97262,"It stuck well (be careful about alignment) and holds well, but it sure does makes some mild noise on top left corner when pressed. Overall pretty good. Edit: my phone fell and the screen protector cracked immediately and glue seems to have disappeared. I kept 3 stars because it saved my screen from cracking.",3

102381,Did not fit window sill,3
99971,I like the layout of the days in the board and it fits my refrigerator fine. Those are the good points. The bad points are that only 2 of the round magnets actually function. The markers write but won't stay in the board with their magnets (plus they don't mark very well). Overall I'm happy with the board but the accesories are fairly useless. My advice is that if you need accessories don't count on these and be prepared to get some from another source.,3

176999,"This pair of glasses is cute, although a little bigger than it looks, but it does not affect my favorite pair of glasses. But I bought the glasses in order to stop the damage of blue light to my eye. I have to say that they did a good job in this respect.",5

26485,"I ordered two of these. One came broken. It was packaged okay, so I believe it was broken due to the mail carrier tossing it onto my porch. The one that did not break, I love. It looks nice on my counter and serves its purpose. Updated review: Ok so the salt cellar that did not break during shipping pretty much shattered at the lightest touch after 3 weeks on my counter. I can no longer recommend this item, clearly they are not very durable at all.",1

1162,"I order hundreds of items from amazon every year and usually leave no reviews, but I am compelled to write about this item. As other mentioned, the glass is extremely thin and feels like it will crack at any point. The metal cover doesnt sit securely on the glass and it feels like there should be another piece holding the metal to the glass, otherwise if you lift the lid, the entire contraption lifts up. If the teapot is anywhere 3/4 full or more - watch out because it will leak no matter how hard you try. It feels like the good reviews either received another item or are fake.",1
1020,"....like just about every other page!! I couldn't believe when I started reading this (with Book 1) and around the fifth chapter, things started feeling freaky. Dialog didn't continue, descriptions faltered, and why? Because every other page was missing. When I checked the other books in the bundle, the same thing occurred. Unfortunately, there's no way that I can find to complain about this to anyone at Amazon. I tried re-downloading, but as I 'm in the midst of another bundle (and this is the first time this has happened since I bought the kindle) I haven't checked to see what's what yet. I will edit this review with an update when I have done so.",1

17250,I had read some of the other reviews prior to purchasing but didn’t think much of the ones that stated it smelt like gasoline. However those were the ones I should have paid attention to. It was so strong I had to return it. My wife even asked why there was the smell of gas in the house.,1

41477,"OK. I am officially done buying cheap garden hoses. Seriously. This thing burst in 32 days. Yes, I left the hose spigot on, but we didn't even break 90 degrees a single day during the month that I had this hose. It burst and was useless in literally 32 days. Amazon, thankfully, accepted my exchange on this hose, even though it was outside of the return window. But now, I am about 15 days into my second hose, and I just can't take the kinks! Literally kinks just by pulling it out. I am returning this hose and buying a hose that is more than twice the price of this one - and 30' shorter! Hoping that 'more money' doesn't equal 'more problems' in this scenario. I, for one, am completely done buying these multi-ply hoses. I am going to invest more in heavy duty, all rubber hoses, and hope that they last longer than a month! Any hose brand that claims ""never kink"" - either in the product title or product description, is a liar - and most likely, their hose kinks worse than any hose you've ever owned! Who would have thought that I would start critiquing garden hoses! I guess they are right - your interests change greatly as you age.",2

40450,Item came in excellent packaging and in a timely manner. The reason for the 2 stars is because it contains high fructose corn syrup and it was purchased for my disabled husband and he can't eat food with this ingredient and I wouldn't have purchased if known otherwise.,2

I liked the product so much I encouraged my sister to use this product to and she saw a quick reduction in her active hormonal acne in about two weeks using it one nightly.",4
146603,"Ran a little big on me, but I would rather it be loose than tight. I may put it in the dryer and try to shrink it a little if it bothers me while wearing it. In fairness, I bought a 2x and I probably needed the lx. I thought it might run small because of the price.",4

158685,"This wallet is amazing. The only reason I don’t leave a 5-star review is that the keychain was not made for a small amount of keys, it’s either you have 4 keys or you have over 8, the bolts weren’t built for for example 5 or 6 keys. Otherwise, this product is a must have for all men! Definitely recommended, sturdy, solid, overall great! Go buy it.",4
