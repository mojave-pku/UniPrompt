85784,Glad the girl didn't die. The story line was too long. Some parts kept repeating itself. The book should have been shorter. Kept on dragging.,3
98749,"Works well, but takes up more space than I was expecting. Photo makes it look smaller than it is.",3
87578,"You get what you pay for I guess. It was quite large. I measured my son and ordered a size smaller than what he would usually wear, the jacket was so big around the waste and the material was not very nice. I did return it and ordered a different one.",3
112066,I don't care for the dropper. I bought this for my car to keep mice away hard to get in tight places,3
96394,"Bought for my husband, he's a size large. Unfortunately, the fit around the arm is pretty tight. The rest fits true to size. He still wears it hoping it will stretch. Its a nice shirt, feels soft, I'd recommend buying a size up just in case.",3
93624,I absolutely love this high chair. The print is adorable and it is so lightweight it's perfect for a small house. My only complaint was the cover was not removable so when my son's diaper leaked on the non wipeable part of the fabric I had to cut and sew the cover to ensure that it was removable. Safety belts still come through and my son is still secure and I don't have to worry about gross stains where he eats. I'm not sure who thought non removable was a good idea for a high chair.,3
106525,Easy read. It dragged.I skimmed a lot. HEA.,3
108218,"Disappointed! I have a Cat and on the test strips, the code I can only see is for a dog. the cat code is wiped off!! i have to buy more strips",3
104626,"I bought this for my mom who had vision problems. I thought this would be the same as the 4 compartment one. This one has a lip separator for each pill box which is a lot more difficult for my mom. The other box allowed you to slide the pill box in place. It is okay for the normal person, but not if vision impaired. Also the lid doesn't close down flat unless you click it closed.",3
102434,"It's exactly what I excepted it to be. However, I just want to state a suggestion/improvement to the product. It would be nice if you have a quantity of 4 sets of legs. That way you could use an extra set to raise your stand a little higher. So I will have 2 spare plastic platforms and 2 outfitted with all the legs. I needed to raise my monitor just a tad more than what was provided. So, I ordered another one just so I can raise my other stand.",3
92390,"Ok read... fun little book, and easy to read. Not sure I can give it more than 3 stars simply because those attracted to its message will have come to it for a purpose of sorts. It is pleasant and even teases to spark the imagination, but I would need something... else. It points, ha, to something but leaves us in the end wanting more.",3
100737,"The first one I bought didn’t fit right so I purchased another, still no luck. The material is fine and they are the cutest thing ever. The problem is the leg area was too big. My dogs back legs would come out and it was actually a bit dangerous because they would get stuck in the clothing.",3
103352,I like the product so far. Packaged came with product oozed out all over container box. Fault of Amazon I think as it was mailed in an envelope (get a clue) Smell is light and husband says it smells like tea. I will update,3
114677,Liked the lights and hooking up wasnt that hard . I dont like ive only had on for 2 weeks and 3 of the led bulbs stopped working .,3

194470,I recently planted vines on 90 ft of fence. The brand name drippers would have cost me $35. These work just as well and cost far less...... and I have many left over for the next project. Highly reccomend! Buy a lifetime supply now while they're still cheap !,5
163429,Great series waiting on the next book.,5

181601,"fast, you adapt very fast to them, it is equal or even better than one with cables",5
175970,Great product great value to complaints even my friends love then saves you money on a tint and keeps the public from seeing your every move I kept two and gave two to a friend she loves them lol.,5
193744,We had a flamingo party and it was suitable for the party theme.Received many compliments from my guests.All off them liked this idea.Full recommend.,5
199639,"Wow! This pillow is so soft and cuddly, you just melt into it. It is large and takes up as much room as a small person. I bought it for my husband, who is recovering from knee replacement surgery. He found it too large to change positions so I took it since I mainly sleep on my right side. Not sure I’ll want it in the summer but it’s nice to have in the cooler weather.",5
199744,"Love, love, love them. I don’t usually like to buy clothes on line, but this was a very specific item I needed and did not want to search all over town so I took a chance and ordered them online, and thank fully I was not disappointed. Holly cow better than I was expecting. Thank you",5

25645,I like the size-but it is not a mini glue gun. It is not the large but it is not the small-medium sized. like the color-but did not realize mini did not accept mini size glue sticks. It has the larger sticks with it and I bought a case of the mini glue sticks. tried a mini and it did not feed,1
5388,Not very good all it does is make a big mess I swear I was very careful it's good for slime but I said just not buying this because if you ever do this in your room when the living room the dining room then all you're going to do is just accidentally make a mess with it,1
33491,"Ordered a large and fits like a small. If you're 5'3"" and 125 lbs, it might fit. Was not allowed to return.",1

However a few months after purchasing the cord melted (pictured) resulting in a minor 2nd degree burn on my leg. Wouldn't buy, highly disappointed and would not recommend!",1

34868,Absolutely horrible! Will not connect and have repeatedly tried to reset it and it will not reset!,1

35548,"Mega pain to use. After fighting this thing for 8 months, I packed it away and just lay the hose on the ground. A gnat could fart and blow this thing over. Not worth the headache at all.",1
10646,"I just received my tree bags in the mail this weekend. I was excited to finally put my tree away and use these brand new bags. I bought the 2 large storage tree bags to break down my 9' tree and separate it into two bags so there would be no capacity issue. The handles may be heavy duty reinforced, but the remaining stitching of the bag is worthless. My tree comes in 4 parts. I put the middle two sections in one bag, zippered the bag and the seam split. The bottom section (largest and heaviest part of the tree) and the very top of the tree (smallest part) fit nicely in one bag, however when I went to zipper it up, one of the zippers fell off. I was glad there was a zipper on the other end of the bag to close it properly. I was not very happy with the product and I specifically bought two so I would not have this seam rip issue. To have the zipper just fall of the end of the other bag without even trying to close it was very disappointing.",1
22560,"We originally ordered these in Nov 2017. The bags were awesome and we never had one break or tear. So when we started running low in March of this year, I made sure to order the exact same product. We did not need to open the second box until a couple weeks ago. I knew something was wrong when I pulled out the very first bag. The plastic was different and it didn't have any ""give"" to it. Needless to say, every single one of them has ripped so far and over very stupid reasons. The corner of an Oreo bag made a 6 in tear and all I did was pick the trash bag up to move it 5 feet away. We are 10 for 10 on damaged trash bags. The worst part... We have a lot of cats. Several times now the torn bags have spilled dirty cat litter all over the floor.",1
24569,The zipper was broken,1
43423,"I hate to leave a bad review because I really like how this works and using it to relieve stress. However, after just a few normal uses, the seam broke and spilled out the rice. I’m not sure if I got a defective product or if it is made poorly, but it’s really frustrating that it broke just a few days after the 30 day return window. It’s not like this is a super expensive item but I definitely would expect it to last more than 1 month for the price. I’m giving it a 2 because it worked well before it broke.",2
62557,"Pretty useless for anything other Than standard Folgers ground coffee. Forget trying to grind whole beans to use in this. The second anything other than a drug store Blend is in this filter, the machine freaks out and starts to overflow.",2
68767,Not very bright at all.,2
71771,"The first two boxes of these seemed good. Slightly thin, but good. The last box I received however is completely unusable. They stink like sulfur, and leave the smell on your hands also. Completely unusable for anything medical.",2
79125,It's a nice ring but colors are not as shown. I wanted a blue ring but that's not what I got,2
66654,"The product is slow and quirky, locks up and poor touch screen. I have geek squad on it many times still happening. Wish I could send it back but we took it on an extended trip and it was nit possible.",2
71397,Not for me. I tried to get ingredients list before buying - I was allergic to some ingredients. I gave it to a neighbor,2
49613,"The picture and description of the item is misleading. They are paint makers, not good for glass or stone. Very misleading",2
79518,They are hard plastic and I feel that once they are on. Putting them on is a hassle. I cannot reach around and put them on once the bra is on and it is almost impossible to put them on first and turn the bra around. I live alone and needed someone to help me with them. Not for me but maybe okay for others.,2
60372,I ordered the correct part but when I tried to line the holes up they didn't match. The holes in the rail were about 1/32 of an inch off. The screws were also the wrong ones. Wrong thread. I sent it back. It looked good. Seemed to be well made and if it fit probably would have been excellent.,2
43701,Some items were of better quality than others.. some items only lasted 5 mins with my dog who isn't an active chewer.,2
60923,It will cover the case but that's it. It's not a snug fit and adds a lot of bulk to the case. It needs to be thinner and tighter.,2
73050,"Two day shipping meant five days to start off with then when I installed the fixture today, both ends were bent, the light bulb receptacles had to be bent and manipulated to make them appear straight and one of the cages that hangs down is broken. After all of the rigging I had to do to it to make it work, it’s not worth it to return the light but I could have gotten better quality for this price at a big box store. Disappointed..",2

61580,Followed instructions but still leaking badly.,2
130316,Product was as described but it just didn't work for me. I was really big when I ordered so it didn't provide much relief. Still was a good product.,4
140316,Finding a good server is difficult and i cant make my own to play with friends but the campaign is fun.,4
152823,They are very cute. The only issue is they are so tiny and the screw backing takes a few tries to put on a wiggly one year old.,4

155550,It was very pretty but breaks easy,4
140803,I wish I'd gotten one with a warm dial and a light to show it's on.,4
127016,I always use a little of this and a little flouride paste together and I love it. I prefer the powder version of this but I’ve used the paste several times and it’s cool too.,4

141688,"These do indeed appear to reduce the vibration noise generated by our large freezer-on-the-bottom fridge. But here's the thing to be aware of... The thought that you can put the pads under the rear rollers and slide back into position (as per the instructions) is a farce. Between the weight of the fridge, and the rubber of the pads, they simply do not slide on the floor. At all. They sit put and the rollers simply roll right over the small top lip of the pad. I even tried to oil the floor, hoping they would glide on a slick surface. No, Ended up having to place the fridge in place, and with the aid of a helper, tilt it forward and push the rear pads into place with a stick while looking under the fridge with a flashlight. Then (much easier), tilting the fridge backwards and placing the front pads in place. Bottom line is this... they do seem to work well, but installing them was a pain in the neck. Almost too much so.",4
139517,Nice skirt! Material is light! Just A little snug and a little shorter with heels on.,4
158657,Shoes fit well but were very heavy,4
