123753,"Wanted to buy one of the new fancy dish drainers. As if it would make washing dishes more fun! None of them fit in one side of my divided sink. Funny, but I had never thought of my sink as small. Gave up my dream of fun dishwashing and bought this drainer of old reliable design. It fits and works perfectly. Some times tried and true things are best. Only thing I would change is having glass holders incorporated into sides to keep mugs and glasses from rolling over or taking too much space.",4

134289,My 2 year old son loves shapes right now so I got this. He likes the pieces and naming them and they liked putting them in the house. Bad things about it is the door to get the shapes back open my kids couldn’t figure out easily how to open it which it is hard to open and then it easily breaks from the hinges. The door is now broke somewhere.,4

Here it is: I love how the tracker fits because it's not uncomfortable at all. I also like the colors because it's not over the top. I bought the black and blue one. It tracks everything and even gives you message notifications like phone calls and text messages but, you only see the messages once and it's gone after you tap on it and read it and if your phone is connected to the device and in close range. My only flaw really is that the battery life doesn't last for more than 2.5 days and then it'll need charged up again. The distance is in km not miles. If anything changes, I'll let you know.",4

I am not the biggest fan of the scents of the candles as they are very strong but they function exactly as described which is great. I'm not sure that there is a way for them to function with a less strong scent. I will probably keep they closed and just as cute shelf pieces instead of burning them very frequently. I would definitely give these candles to someone with a pet as a gift. They are wrapped very nicely and look very professional.,4

I wish it had a strap in the front so I can pull it down and block the sun from coming down through the front. I'm sure I'll find a way of using it that works for us and I like it well enough so far.

You don't get much for the money, but as a crafter, I do use this when I want some ""play time"". Also, the head has a ""v"" shape tip, so it is difficult to use in small areas.

He turns the timer on randomly during the day because it's the bat signal. Great to give as a fun gift if the person you're getting it for likes Batman or buy it for yourself.

The two included remotes already have batteries installed. So, you'll need 18 AAA batteries which cost roughly $15 USD to purchase.

158503,I got these for my mom who likes to watch TV before bed but always complains she doesn't sleep well. I'm hoping they help. I tried them on myself. They are comfortable and stylish and do a good job of blocking the blue light. She says they are comfortable on her nose which is a big deal because it is her biggest complaint against wearing any glasses.,4
124972,I like these little things because they're small and cute and I work in vineyards so it feels personal but they aren't perfect. if you stick the bottom point into the crease of the book hoping that it will sort of wedge itself in there and stand upright it just falls over. basically the rubber is a little too thick so it doesn't tightly wedge in there but I mean it's a place holder so it is what it is. I'd recommend them.,4

136721,"I bought the K2 to give myself additional room for at least one of my kiddos and gear. The seat is basically useless as the back has zero rigidity. I sat on the seat and just let the back side flip down to give myself and extra long seat for shifting around. The legroom is great for me at 5’2” and probably will be suitable for up to an average height man or woman. The kayak itself sit very well made and inflates/deflates within minutes. I used an electric pump so much quicker. It definitely will take a little longer with the manual pump that comes with it but should still be reasonable. The only issue Ive noticed is the the bottom portion tends to lose air. I noticed on both trips after coming out of the water, the bottom had deflated just slightly. So I would recommend taking the manual pump with you for longer trips in the water just to be safe. This is the only reason I’m giving just 4 stars. Overall, I’m very happy with this kayak. I’m new to kayaking and this is a great one for beginners or leisurely paddles around the lake.",4
150265,"At first this product didn't seem appealing at all. It feels very greasy when you put it on your skin and it does not smell good. I found that if I wear it at night while I'm sleeping, it is much more tolerable. I have been using it on my feet at night and it has really softened my heels. It doesn't take much for it too work. I am looking forward to using it for DIY projects. This product doesn't give off the best first impression but it really does work as a moisturizer. A little goes a long way with this product so this sized jar should last a long time.",4

126331,I usually don’t write reviews but felt the need to share my opinion on this one. My 6 year old broke his elbow requiring pins and a full arm cast a week before spring break. We wanted at least one beach day... even if it was just playing in the sand and not the water. I purchased this product but was really nervous at first telling my son to not submerge his arm completely under the water- well he listened like any typical 6 year old. With in 5 minutes he was swimming with the fish. I checked it right away and his cast was completely dry. Very pleased with this purchase! The only thing I didn’t like was how hard it was to put on but if you follow the directions (like I did the second time) it wasn’t bad at all. He didn’t complain of it being too tight on his arm either. Great product!,4
145475,"This cat tree is really pretty and fits well in my one bedroom apartment. It was a bit of a headache to put together (but I guess that's a bit to be expected). My cat is a bit uninterested in it right now, but I suspect that before long she'll discover it (hah hah I think she's a bit fearful of it). I have a small 1 year old cat (probably not fully grown, maybe 10 lbs?? idk). It seems large enough for her, though the small pad on the side that she could theoretically use as a step to the next level looks like it might be too small (but maybe she'll figure out how to use it anyway). I can come back and leave more info later when she starts actually playing on the thing. Anyway, it's about what I expected from amazon (because the parts were all there and it didn't seem to be a knock-off of an original product lol). I still can't wrap my head around how expensive these things are given the materials are a bit cheap, but it appears steady enough. The fabric that was used is a nice blue color (exactly as pictured on amazon) and it's very soft. The specific things I would suggesting changing in this model are (1) make the board material a bit heavier/more substantial, (2) wrap the fabric covering all the way around the underside of the boards that are higher up because the top two levels underside can be seen when standing, and (3) make that small ledge a bit larger. Otherwise, the tree seems really great, and I think the cat will enjoy it.",4

146609,Works fine and quite easy to handle. Definitely help the messy chore.,4
124266,"Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this product, except for the fact that I'll have to do some modifications. The fabric super nice and thick, no need to worry about seeing through. I got the red, and it does appear a little bit lighter than the picture when in daylight, but nothing that bothers me too much. I have two very small issues with the dress. The first one is the sleeves have some holes, and they're a little bit too low for my liking, the sleeves are a perfect length for me naturally, and the some holes are a little bit higher up which stretches the fabric. I feel if you had shorter arms, this wouldn't be much of an issue but for me it was since I'm a little bit longer there. My other issues that I'm quite busty, and the corset comes too high up. It comes up about halfway up my bust, so I'm going to remove the top couple fabric eyelets.

39975,"Bought this after watching my neighbor use a pole saw(different brand) to cut numerous branches and low bush. Ordered this one and what a disappointment. Saw would not cut anything greater than 1"" in diameter without stopping. Then wood chips backed up in the chain saw cover binding up the blade. Checked everything over and seemed to be fine. Note I have two regular chain saws, 2 cycle hedge trimmer, and 2 cycle tiller so I am familiar with these engines. Had to return it and probably will go down to the local hardware store and buy something. The extra blade I got for it was more expensive to ship back than what I paid for it so I am stuck with that . Perhaps I just got a bad one, but not worth the risk of exchanging.",1

Bag of rice and it was up and going but off a bit. She washed her hands at preschool and it was done for. Wish we’d paid more attention to waterproof watches - this doesn’t handle water well at all. It wasn’t submerged. It’s a bathroom and it’s going to get wet with little hands learning. Very bummed to lose $20 down the drain.,1

4117,I used this brand of screen protector for my Galaxy S6 for many years and was very happy with the fit and ease of installment.

25866,"The Good: Picture quality is good, as is night vision. Both on par with what you would expect. There is a separate base station with it's own storage (via SD card), so no monthly fees to get your data off the cloud. The Bad: Pretty much everything else. The cameras have to be connected to the base station, not your WiFi network, so you can only get so far away from the base station. In my house there is just no way to cover both sides of the house with one base unit. Very frustrating because I already have a mesh WiFi system that covers the whole house and yard. The motion detection is astonishingly bad. It records dozens of little 6 second clips of nothing. I have tinkered with sensitivity, and pointing the camera slightly differently. Nothing works. There is no way to tell what motion is being detected -- most of the time I can't see anything moving. The front door cam is triggered by mystery movements, but ignores people coming to door more than half the time. The ""Activity zone"" feature (which to be fair is marked as beta) seems to have no effect at all. The system allows several different setup scenarios such as home, and away, disabled, etc. There is no way however to have them auto set based on location -- the obvious thing would be to allow my to set away automatically when I leave (or my phone does anyway :)) IFTTT integration would solve this problem, but alas non is provided. I deeply regret purchasing this -- the system is way overpriced for what you get, and what you get is disappointing at any price.",1

The other seems to be ok, but Amazon is refusing to take back the broken compass they sent me.

I would have lost two others but I could tell they where stressed so I helped them hatch. My problem with this incubator is one 1) you can't see the humidity rate in it. There is no humility monitor built in. 2) it's very hard to see inside. You have about and inch on the sides but when chicks start to hatch the sides fog up.

107063,These are cute nail accessories but would have been nicer to have some instructions for use or at least tips.,3
93022,"I purchased this because several reviews said that their phone screen didn't break when in the case - even when dropped. That was not the case for me. Everytime i've dropped it, even just a little bit (on the side and a short distance), it has left my screen with a crack. For someone who isn't as clumsy as me, im sure this would be sufficient.",3
115623,"I've been using Pureology for a while now. I love that they are a vegan, cruelty-free line. My hair has been feeling really dry lately and since I've been using Pureology's moisturizing shampoo & conditioner for a while, I decided to mix it up and get this Precious Oil shampoo and conditioner instead. Like with most Pureology products, I love the way my hair feels. It's soft and bouncy. However, I'm not in love with the smell. It's heavy and perfume-y. And my hair continues to smell like the product for at least a day or so after washing. It kind of gives me a headache. I won't be buying this one again, but I'll certainly be buying one of Pureology's other lines instead.",3
90054,"Usually when we get the same size with other suppliers it fits, but this time came a little bit oversized",3

94922,Need to have a larger bottom strap,3
94287,Button was scuffed and not put on strait when it came.......,3
82945,The fabric is very nice. I like the feel. It’s not scratchy. It’s easy to tie to the comforter. I also really liked the directions that came with the cover itself for easiest way to get the cover on the comforter. I have a king sized so that was really helpful for me. When I went to zip the cover up I noticed A LOT of loose seems and loose threads along the seams of the cover. Especially around the zipper. Very very disappointed by this. I’ve decided to keep it as I like all other aspects of this cover. I got mine in white and it’s true white. I just wish the quality was better. That really was a disappointment for me. I’ve reinforced the seam as best as I can by hand. I will just be sure to maybe but the next cover in person.,3
90679,the package was a little damaged when it got here the plastic on the side was open and the little pieces were all around.,3
115910,I would like to get the bottom cover replaced as it wore off and broke in less than 4 months..,3
100631,This child seat is of average quality. The mounting is not secure. The bottom plastic is easy to scratch the leather chair.,3

83305,I expected more character development and a more complex plot. I found the book to be repetitive with too much time focused on the character's internal struggles and not enough on intrigue.,3
98872,"No inch ruler, only cm.",3
112969,The product is fine and as good as any other similar charging pad but the circular shaped pads all seem to have the same flaw - you have to place the phone in just the right direction to get it to charge. The stand type chargers force you to put it down in the right way but the circular pads obviously don’t so they’re not as good.,3
83845,The bracelet broke the next day randomly beads everywhere but the case is really pretty,3
113618,"This product depends upon: Solar availability, care of water level, and 'patience'. In addition, it really needs more detailed directions, and how to deal with the intermittent spray/no spray. It does not just 'start up' and continue running with direct sunlight. The fine print on the back of directions suggests you leave it out of the water in full sunlight for two hours. This is really a good way to 'charge' the battery. I still need to try this. Who knew you could 'charge' a lithium battery? I am working on the fine tuning this requires, because when it works, it's really great! Yes, it is slightly overcast right now, and it does spray intermittently. Also, the needs for water need to be monitored. With a good capacity it does well. In lesser water volume it needs extra attention . I was inclined to give up on this, but do enjoy it so much when it functions. A work in Progress.",3
106523,"Item is OK, but over priced and so so quality",3
111006,The outer carton was intact but the product wrapping was all torn. There was no damage to the papers themselves except for few small indentations on the edges but after flattening the defects the papers should feed through the printer without jamming. The bubble wrap inside the carton were totally flat. These comments were true for each of the three cartons I received.,3

Once the propane bottle is inserted, you can hear and smell the propane and the clicker will NOT start the flame. It’s necessary to use a separate lighter device (which we never had to do on the first one). Not sure if something in the quality of manufacturing changed, or if we just got a dud.",3

105248,Smaller than expected. Disappointed.,3
90673,"This book was in many ways a typical Riley Hart book, which means it was well written and had an awesome cast of friends and real/found family which always adds so much depth to her characters and her books. Actually, that may be the biggest reason I love her books in general. I way enjoyed the protagonists Ash and Beau and the progression of their relationship. I guess for me, although I was glad to spend time with Kenny, Beau’s brother, it was sort of understood that Beau needed to stick around close to home to help with Kenny, and yet other than occasional speech issues, Kenny seemed to be functioning just fine. So to me he came across more as a plot device than a person because I just couldn’t get a handle on him. So for me the book was good, but not great.",3
90849,Alot of stuff but not as useful as i thought they would be.,3
89037,"Good characters, good, light mystery with intrigue. Pretty quick page turner. Several typos. Will read book four and see if editing is better.",3
109566,"It worked wonders on the copper bottoms of some of my pots! They were shinier than new BUT it ruined two very, very old cookie sheets, rubbing off all the finish so that I had to toss them out.",3
118609,"The glue that makes these lights adhesive is very weak. I hung these lights in a straight line behind my tv to provide some ambiance. Less than 6 hours after installing, they were hanging off the wall and needed to be held up by tape. I ended up super gluing these into place and wish I had not paid the ""extra"" to buy lights that were ""self-adhesive"". You are better off buying lights without glue on the back and installing yourself. Flexible is also a misleading description for this item. I wrapped these lights behind my tv in straight lines with ""rounded corners"" so I didn't cut the strips. The moment you try to hang these lights any way besides straight (i.e. corners) you WILL HAVE TO USE SUPER GLUE. They do bend but if you aren't holding it in place then they go back to their natural state - straight. The remote control works well but the lights shows are not as customizable as the description made me believe. If you want to have the lights change color, it just cycles all the color values. You cannot have it just cycle between blue and white or something like that. I don't think these are actually capable of doing any colors besides those pre-installed on the remote. Trying to use the RGB +/- buttons to tweak the colors does not appear to do anything. These are super bright! Only aspect of this item that warrants more than 3 stars.",3
113476,Super small bag. Other than my chrome book I can’t really fit much else . The quality is good though.,3
85481,"I couldn't get it to work with my setup but at least it was an easy return. I would not buy this for a pond, which was my use. The cord is really short but more importantly, it is not grounded. It seems like an electrocution risk.",3
91560,This is what the driver did to my yard today!,3
80496,It is extremely small and it might fit a 2 year old girl but definitely not a four year old. I have to return the item.,3
105604,So much smaller then I thought they were going to be,3
101774,Its very soft seems durable. Took less than three weeks to get it and that’s with ordering on Xmas day. So far so good except the paints chipped on the bottom but that’s no biggie. I have yet to use it though.,3
103260,"Was a little disappointed as the photo showed it looking Silver/Black but is actually bright yellow/Black. The quality is good, I’m still using it and have no issues about a month later.",3
92802,"Tested this product out, I let the ink sit to soak the brush for a day so it was 100% coated, but that's mainly cause i forgot about it (it should take only a small bit of time to soak to the brush). Looks like it's made for short, tiny/skinny lines, because when you try to go bigger/thicker/curvier, the brush paints/looks like like a frayed, dried marker. Also, the package comes with only 2 ink cartridges, theres not one in the pen. Yhe entire thing is in a different language(not a bad thing), so if you dont know how cartridges work with pens or any details you'll have to look it up!",3
91848,"I've had the humidifier for a couple of weeks, and I've followed the manual. However, I can't keep the water from seeping into the base of the unit.

119934,"I bought/received two of these. The first one required a return because while the green light powered on, the speaker wasn't working and I was unable to hear any noise. The second one arrived without any problems, but I realized shortly thereafter that this isn't the ideal sound machine. I planned on using it every night for my son. However, it runs on batteries and I began to worry that they'd eat up those batteries relatively quickly. I ended up keeping the device because it was my oversight that this doesn't have any support for A/C power, but we stopped using it right after. I bought another sound machine for my baby with a plug this time. Now all my kids have identical sound machines which works fine for us.",3
97860,Not too good quality,3
87909,"Disappointed in this gate. Overall it’s exactly what I was looking for, purchased to keep my toddler out of the kitchen. The install wasn’t exactly a breeze, but wasn’t terrible either. Was actually really satisfied the first 2 days - however by day 3, the latch is already sticking and you have to jiggle the handle/button it to get the gate latched. For the price it definitely should’ve lasted more than 3 days. So now I have to decide if I want to send back or not, which is extra annoying since it was a hassle to put up in the first place.",3
87499,No instructions and the shoulder pads don’t really attach to the vest. Kind of not clear how to use them correctly. Would also be nice to have labels on the weights so you can see how much they weight.,3

112489,Not a bad game. Bonus money could be more. Some of the games are a little childish,3
111014,Breaks very easily. We’ve been through 2 in a few weeks.,3
102693,It is a nice piece but I think the cost is more then what you get. The wood feels like a cheap plastic coating on top and all the parts where not used but came with no instructions. It works well for the time being.,3
109785,"I purchased this item to burn into wood for decorative pieces. The pen does not get hot enough and if it does, the heat does not last long. I have to keep walking away so that it can reheat. The tips unscrew easy which forces you to have to continuously screw it back which involves using the silicone tips or turning the pen off completely to tighten the screw. Overall, it has made me frustrated enough to give up.",3
85165,this product has a lot of features but the laser is odd shape and flickers. other than that it's ok for the price. nice for night use for varmint. mounted on my 223. no problem with reticles sticking.,3

102401,"Trust the other reviews and save yourself the aggravation! I really like the print on this pillowcase-thus the 3 stars. However, as others have stated, the zipper opening is ridiculously tiny!!! It will take a team of people to wrangle a body pillow into the tiny opening on this pillowcase. It's half as big as the small end of the case. I guess they must have only had tiny zippers on hand? Anyway, after struggling for 10 minutes, I was completely frustrated by my inability to fit the pillow through the zippered opening, and just gave up. I could see the signs of stress on the pillowcase at the zipper's end, and am afraid it's going to rip next time I try to put a pillow in there. Bummer... :(",3

This Drinking Bird dips like it is supposed to, but its dipping motion causes it to scoot all over the surface - including off the table before you know it.

115818,"I have had issues with stress and anxiety from my cat. We thought we corrected the issue and learned we had not. To attempt to find something that works for my cat, the vet suggested calming treats. After some research on different brands I found these and the price was right. I ordered them. They are too big for most cats to take straight, so I have to cut one treat up. We only use them every other weekend when we have the BFs daughter. My cat doesn’t particularly care for them and won’t eat them freely. I have to come up with creative ways for him to ingest them. I paired these treats, with a diffuser, and a calming collar. That seemed to relax him to the point he wasn’t aggressive and urinating outside the box. I think a combo of these treats and the diffusers really helped. I would give him one in the AM And then another in the PM, unless he displayed behavior that required an earlier dosage.",3

The thing that I like most about this helmet is the adjustable back. My three year old and five year old can both wear this helmet, which is great! I wasn't sure if this would fit my five year old, his head measures 55 cm, but the small was a perfect fit. The helmet also has a padded chin strap which makes it comfortable to wear. My three year old often refuses his helmet, but I had no problems with this one.",5
199538,"Received my wig on time & had a gift of ventilated wig caps included with it. The wig looks exactly like the wig advertised. I have a fairly large forehead , but this cap is comfortable & fits perfectly. The hair is full & dense & the curls are beautiful. The mixed brown & blonde color is exactly as described & beautiful. Curls are soft, very realistic, & without that high shine that most people hate. Because it’s a tight ,curl, you will need to either finger comb & or shake it & use a pick to style it the way you want. The wig is compressed on delivery & because of that I shake it first , then I use a spritzer containing water & a small amount of a detangling leave in conditioner that I spray on the wig ,before I shake it a 2nd time & style it. It’s a lot of hair which I like because it fits my face. However some ppl might want to tweeze out hairs or use other methods of reducing the bulk. The only thing I could ask for to make this wig better is for it to be a lace front. I highly recommend this cost saving, beautiful wig.",5

181912,"I'm usually the type to save up my money to buy legit, more expensive products from reputable brands because I believe the increased cost is a superior investment in the long term. But this time I decided to go the other route after doing my researching and finding out the ludicrous costs of keyboards from brands like razer and corsair. I was hesitant at first because this product is obviously from china and from a not so known brand. But after looking at the high reviews from other customers, I decided to take the plunge. I went with the stainless steel, blue-back lit option. So far after a year of use, I'm happy to report that this product is worth the cost. For only $40 you get a well made product with good (but unnecessary) features. The clicks are very tactile and is a joy to use. They are extra loud which some of you might prefer. But be aware that the loud noise might be an annoyance to others. I had to use my laptop keyboard in my room at night to not awake my roommate. Tha back lit feature is welcome but after using it for the first month, I leave it off. Actually, I'm only writing this review because I enjoy the typing experience on the keyboard so much and am using it to write this. Overall, a good $40 investment if you enjoy typing and are seeking an entry level mechanical keyboard to experience it.",5

185512,"I often use my Iphone 6S plus. It's always out of power, so I bought this cell phone charging box in Amazon. It's really good to use, it can be carried in real time, it can be put in your trousers pocket, it can be put in your bag, it doesn't need to use charging wires, and it can protect your Iphone 6S plus, let's go. It is free from wear and tear. It's not very big, and it weighs just right. It charges really fast. There are many reasons to like this situation. One reason is that it feels smooth but not slippery. So it won't slip away from me. Gold: Another important reason I really like this charger is that you can use your iPhone charger! Therefore, you don't need to carry extra cables with you, or you don't need to use two cables. If you don't have Bluetooth headset, you can still use the headset adapter. Gold: In addition, it charges very fast and lasts a long time. I think I can charge my cell phone twice when a full battery is charged",5

I am paranoid and double seal all my bags, of course, it stopped after several times, but i know it is normal. Because the seller told me there is a protection design. By the way, some guys may grasp wrong way, the bag should be loaded in the correct position, just like the picture i showed.otherwise,it's impossible to do vacuum and make air out of bag.

195560,"This T-shirt is GREAT. I was really surprised., because I don't usually order T-shirts online. I'm a funny one to fit (5'3"" and over 200 lbs, most of it in the middle, which makes it hard to fit most clothing). So I ordered the XXL and it fit perfectly. Now, like every single thing I put on, it hugs up to me too much on my gut, but that's my gut, NOT the shirt's fault at all. Once I lose about 10 lbs (of the 50+ I need to lose), it will fall and flow just perfectly. Usually, I have to order a size larger than I wear just to fit my middle, then the shoulders and neck are too big. With this shirt, the shoulders and neck are perfect, and will be even once I lose the 10 LBS. Can't wait to order more colors of these!! Love the material and colors.",5

These exclusive RexBeti quality hex keys have a desired appeal while also featuring an elongated arm to help reach any challenges while minimizing possible danger to the hand.

66075,Purchased or my sister as a girt. She swore by the brand but this model lasted her only a few months before the strap broke. It also was not effective in keeping her food cooled.,2

56646,"I really liked this bra, it fit great which many of don't, but after owning it for less than two months it's already broken. There is a hook on the strap that attaches to the back and it broke off. The hook allows the straps to be warn criss-cross if you want - which I never did - but the down side is the hook easily bent, would hook onto shirts I wore, and then the strap would come off. Many times I would have to bend the hook back in shape in order for the strap to stay attached. This morning the hook finally broke. It's such a bummer to finally find a sports bra that fits and seems to be supportive enough to be able to run in it only to have it break in less than two months.",2
68193,Seems thiner compared to other wash tape I have used in the past. Probably won't work on dark colors.,2
73646,"Honestly, the size is amazing for my bunny. Great large wide cage love love LOVE the size. but absolutely HATE the way its built. so many damn pieces, it is so hard to get the top of the cage on to the bottom without a five minute battle. Makes cleaning so dreadful. I have figured out zip ties in ever corner and every where really secures it to be sturdy. but seriously, I don't know how any one can give this a 5 stars with no issues with it what so ever. PLEASE make this cage better.",2
72462,The interface is clunky. But the really annoying thing is the menus are static and risk burn in on the TV. The small amount of information that is displayed should float around the screen and there should be a screen saver option. Also the cube should be able to read me a book through the stereo without turning the tv on at all.,2
58143,"Was expecting a lot more from the author since online he speaks horribly of modern poetry as if he is writing some ""new to this earth"" stuff. Some poems are good, but they aren't all that.",2

77772,There very dim and one of the parts came broke. I’m using them but very disappointed,2
77572,"Liked this at first but took it on a 2nd trip and the light doesn't come on now. So useless in the dark. Would not buy again. Easy to set the alarm, seems durable, and I like the 8 minute snooze. Downside is that the light is bright and a little hard to look at when you're half asleep and snoozing it (not like the old Timex Indiglo which was visible and a softer light). It's a little bigger than I was expecting but I didn't really look at the dimensions. Would buy again.",2
69205,"I seriously recommend you find a different product or spend the extra money on a quality product! After reading many glowing reviews I decided to try this Takstar. I immediately regretted my decision. My batteries would get so hot that you could feel the heat emanating from the product. I attempted to use it anyway, despite my better judgement. The sound quality is ok, at best. WARNING: The Takstar not only eats batteries, but it makes them so hot that they melt into the product itself! After examining the product and information thoroughly and going through three different batteries in this way...I had no choice but to throw it away. It's a sad waste of money.",2

49727,"I needed some new tweezers that would be good at getting those newly grown brow hairs that are so hard to pluck. Unfortunately, these did NOT do the trick. I usually don't feel a thing when I tweeze my brows since I've been doing it for at least 20 years, but these hurt. I don't know if it's the fact they're too sharp on the edges or what, but they wouldn't pull the hairs out smoothly. I ended up sending them back for a refund.",2

The tear doesn't let air out, but since its along the stitching I can tell it will only get worse. Other than the tear the float is very nice and I'm sure I would have spent many happy pool days in it.",2

40665,Extreme bias. It seems that the main focus of the paper is to discredit President Trump often with views that are either dishonest or only halfway factual. Near complete absence of positive accomplishments adds greatly to the bias. I won’t be renewing the subscription.,2

76784,Too big! Need to return please!,2
59146,Anybody else honk it’s annoying that you have to unplug the player before takin it out of the case? And you can’t open the player while in the case. I have a few design improvements in my head that would make this a much more desirable product. I also wish there was a strap that went vertical so that the player would actually be flat and easier for my son to see the screen.,2

It is easy to install, I’ll give it that.",2
50813,These are not as bold yellow as they are pictured. More of a pale yellow-greenish yellow. I was hoping for a school bus or sunshine yellow. Disappointing.,2
46340,Perhaps it was due to a shipping mishap but this arrived with pegs broken off. It does seem sturdy thou and didn’t have any splintering wood pieces. This is much narrower than another 60 count racks I own as well(the dimensions may be listed but I didn’t think to look at them due to all my others being the same size),2
42302,"Like the size and paired easily with the phone. Issue is when I started running, the control piece was too heavy, it kept pulling the right side headphone out of my ear. I tried several times, but they made for an unsuccessful run. Returning today.",2
40797,"As stated the quality and power of this unit does not match its price. The top panel controls are so so, Bluetooth on it is crap, and the remote only works by a weird 3.5mm cable with very limited range signal receiver on it. Oh and the sound quality is only good when you keep the volume modest though little bass to speak of. When you crank it the speaker quickly begins to distort. Literally just gave the device away.",2
68632,arrived late and the book not good enough !!!,2
57373,"Product said 100% cotton so I bought on Amazon because the tie dye online store was out and had rave reviews of this particular shirt not having poly stitching.

53849,Liked the idea of it but it's very bulky and the magnets SUCK,2
47998,Whoever designed the cage and this product is evil. The bottom pan in the cage is practically useless because it is so shallow. They should either include this product with the cage or make deeper pans. Putting this thing together and getting it to fit in the cage is a nightmare. Say goodbye to being able to close the cage doors!!! Yet another poorly designed and difficult product from Midwest. Unfortunately I only got this cage because it is the least horrible in a bare market.,2
53803,You get what you pay for. The Olympic Barbell fitting is too large for most bars. I can’t imagine that a CAP barbell would be this large either or no other brands would fit their bars. The two pictures show the discrepancy in sizing from standard Olympic barbell sleeve diameters. Don’t recommend. Spend the extra $0.10 a pound and get something that won’t shake on the bar.,2
63770,"This review is only for the stripped pattern, as I haven't yet tried any of the other designs. I am average sized for an American woman, but I couldn't get the stripped part of the tights above my knees; the design had absolutely no give. The standard part of the tights (where it transitions from black to tan) didn't seem to have this problem, so I think the trick with this product is being mindful of the design you choose.",2
65596,Because of the prongs are plastic they start to slightly rub away and move at the lightest use of measuring something wood or metal. Thus you are adding space and making an inaccurate reading. Upon first handling the tool it can keep slightly moving due to it being plastic. Just sitting there it can change the reading.,2

40926,"Bought these to keep my new stove cleaner so that splatters would not get on the burners. They don't look the greatest, but they did cover the burner. These are thin and cheap and if you turn the wrong burner on, the paint on these will flame up in a short time. I threw mine in the trash. If I buy covers again, I will go back to the solid, heavy, enameled ones that are safer and look better.",2
77634,Liked the grill but 1 lamp quit working on first try.,2
63475,First time time trying to use this the plastic handle piece broke off. If that already wasn't enough the umbrella nylon material feels like a paper thin nylon jogging rain jacket shell and I am skeptical it would hold up to any strong rain/wind. The stitching was already coming apart before the first use and to add insult to injury the vinyl smells terrible -- a mix between rotten garbage and plastic that has melted in the sun.,2
49868,"I bought this because I finally finished with a bottle of Mesmerize from a few years ago and thought it would be nice to try all the products. The roll-on and body wash are just okay, but the body lotion was awful and had a weird, off-putting and cheap smell that didn't compliment the cologne at all. This new bottle of cologne is very weak and after about 1 hour there was no scent left. Nothing compared to the bottle I had just used. Not even close. The bottle and cap look different, too. It was like a very weak knock off. Not buying again.",2

57283,"These casters were simple to install and seemed to be of decent quality. After testing them out on my hardwood floor, I was left with a couple of concerns. 1. The wheels will catch debris, and unless they are maintained consistently, will end up scratching the flood. 2. The wheels only have one point of contact with the floor, while traditional casters have two. While this decreases friction and helps them move easier, it could leave indentations in some flooring surfaces. 3. When moving while seated, the wheels can bind when changing directions, which was annoying. 4. This last issue seems a little silly, but these wheels move too well. I found myself gliding away from my desk unless I had my feet firmly planted on the floor. So, unless you are interested in some racing wheels for your office chair (which these would be fantastic for), I can't recommend them as a substitute for a good chair mat.",2
58763,"First of all, these are not anti-fingerprint. My company cell phone has an anti-fingerprint glass screen protector and this is not it. Secondly, it went on just fine, but the edges don't seem to want to seal properly. I ended up removing the first one and trying the second, only to have it do the same thing. I've left the second one on, but I have a feeling it won't stay on long, so they were both a waste imo.",2
65192,Cheap cheap. Cheap. You get what you pay for. Doesn't last long with a toddler that really wants to jam,2
46618,I liked the product but after three months I could not get a four bar power bar regardless of how long Zi put it in full sun to charge Disappointed,2
74313,I would not recommend !!! I've only had this for two months and now it's sometime charge and other times it doesn't . I am so disappointed.,2
59935,Way too sweet... maybe I’m not used to this style but it feels like I’m eating vegetable with sugar.,2
42142,"Was not the color I ordered, and extremely thin material..",2
77277,i think this product got to hot in shipment and there for its not working as well or it just is not that great.,2
46786,These shoes are nice and light and would dry quickly. However the tie on one of the shoes does not catch and hold so that if worn in the water it would become so loose that the shoe would come off. Therefore it needs to be returned unworn in the water. How is this product returned? There was no packing slip in the bag.,2
63643,"I have a couple products from Radha Beauty that are great. I really wanted to love this humidifier but the warm mist option simply doesn't work. It is also impossible to fill without making a bit of a mess reconnecting the tank to the basin. All of the other functions are great, especially the essential oil compartment. If you don't care about warm mist, this is fine. If you were hoping for a warm mist to help you out through a freezing New England winter like I am, maybe skip this one.",2
58025,Good design but touch sensitivity is horrible:(,2
58860,"I bought this product to keep my young children out of my cabinets. I liked the thought of not having to drill holes in cabinets or having large bulky locks on the outside of handles. I received my order in a timely manner. I was under the impression that “12 pieces” meant 12 locks...super excited about that! I was very disappointed when I opened the box to find only 10 and even more disappointed when 2 broke while installing. So now, I have 5 locks which have lasted about a month and a half. 3 locks have broke off or the adhesion has dried up. Overall I’m not impressed and wouldn’t recommend this product.",2
78656,"I liked it, as did my son whom I purchased it for but it had string out and eventually came loose and pieces lost so now it’s broke",2
75471,Didn’t last long broke shorty after having it,2
64909,"WAY shorter than the pictures... almost comically short. I bought it in a pinch of time for my daughter for a wedding and it's just not what I thought. Also... if you do order, Order up a size or two. Really cute print tho. The pockets are at a strange height too, too low.",2
62340,"The interface with computer is good, the sound quality is good, the delivery was fast and it works well for running. For front-crawl swimming- not so much. I tried different bud sizes and different ways to jam it in the goggles bend, but it still kept filling with water..",2
42532,"Plastic Connection, not too good I returned",2
60984,"The style is exactly what I wanted, and the price was right. Sound quality is very impressive. But the earpiece angle is all wrong for my ears. The part where the sound comes out tends to press against the skin rather than send sound into the ear. I've tried shifting them around, wearing them backwards -- it's no good. Since Sony quit making their marvelous similar-style headphones I've been looking for a replacement. This isn't it! Maybe they might fit your ears and head but they sure don't work for me Advice: save your packaging so you can return them. Better advice: save your money and buy something else. I'm smarter -- and $13 poorer -- for having bought these.",2
60578,I bought this specifically for fast charging my Galaxy S7 Edge which it does not do. The Dual Ports will be nice for charging other devices maybe?,2
41004,Cheaper quality material. Wouldn’t buy again but for the 6 washes they will be able to handle they fit great!,2
45149,"Came with 4 screens. Mine popped off after a few days, my husbands had three cracks in it after 2 weeks. We put on the other two and they worked better, but they soon cracked too. It's not like I flail my arms around, so I really don't know what I must be hitting my arms on, but these didn't last very long.",2
74298,"This product broke after a few months unfortunately. The little pin that resides where the spring is that lifts the lid, came out and it no longer closes tightly, so it no longer whistles.",2
73210,This is the second order for this vehicle. I just order this product on August 14. We installed it within a week we received it. The product cracked at the top within an hour. The vehicle is down again and we are out of $$. We will not reopen this again.,2
59029,The quality of my previous blankets were so much better. This one is not as soft and feels cheap. I will not be buying another one and I have used this brand (they changed their name) blanket for over 15 years. Disappointed does not begin to describe how let down I feel by this brand.,2
70213,I feel very unsafe. I can see another house. And definitely thats is not my house. I don't know what happen...But this is my first time using a inside camera...but when I see the other house I Run fast and take out from my kids room,2
60408,I have ordered more of these chargers than I can count. They all die out within 1-2 months.,2
62632,Wrong color sent. Sent Sierra when I ordered dark brown. Didn’t want to deal with the hassle of returning them but I already had a pair of this color,2
40152,These brooches are not ideal for making an all brooch bouquet. They maybe ideal to adhere to flowers for a combination bouquet as I did.,2
54208,Does not stay on dash,2

42098,"For me (and that doesn't necessarily mean the same for you!) the lights just are not bright enough for nighttime reading. I replaced all the batteries with fresh ones, just in case, and no discernible change.",2
61170,After a month of use I noticed that a 15 foot end section was not working. After having a closer look I discovered the wire was damaged from abrasion (wind plus Tree). The part I want to warn users of this product about is that the worn out section of wire sparked and did not blow the fuse. The lights remained on.,2
48409,"Ok, the appliance works great, except the hose gets brittle and breaks. Try to get a new one and the company doesn't sell it directly, have to go through an appliance repair place, even though I assembled the hose on the bissel in the first place. There's no repair place nearby so I'm SOL. So the thing works fine except a cracked hose, which I've tried to patch together with electrical tape that leaks.",2
77500,Not able to access. Groupon not cooperating. Instructions don't work and they refuse to acknowledge. Waste of money!,2
47463,"Tested it out for about a month - overall found that it was pretty ineffective despite the positive reviews. I had all 4 plugged in different rooms of a 900 sq ft apartment. One in the bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, and one in the bathroom. It seemed to work for the first few days, which is why I'll give it 2 stars. However after about a week/week and a half we saw roaches/ants/other bugs again. At one point, I saw a roach crawling on the wall directly across from where it was plugged in in our bedroom (less than 6 ft away). We also saw ants/roaches in the kitchen despite having it plugged in all the time. We tried moving them around, putting more than 1 in a room, etc but no luck. We're having an exterminator come again today and I'll be looking for a better solution. overall, seems like more of a gimmick than anything",2

I should have checked the reviews and ""skipped"" on the vinyl. See what I did there! ;D Bad review is just for the Vinyl option ... not on the music. Amazing music.",2

I used one for 2 weeks straight and it didn’t do anything. I use this when I feel the symptoms get a little worse but I don’t think it does anything, can yeast gain an immunity to boric acid? I don’t think so.. ineffective",2
44895,"I purchased this based on the reviews. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. I was nervous when it said to take 4 pills two times day. I started the first day with 2 pills twice a day to ease into it. The following night I started with 4. Nothing. It wasn’t until day 4 when I had a bm. It’s a joke. I mean, 4 pills at once says enough, not powerful. Everyone is different, just didn’t work for me.",2

53838,Purchased this monitor in February of 2018. Within the first month there was screen tearing and dead pixels. I turned off the monitor and it started working again just fine till about a week ago. Now its more persistent than before. Be warned when buying DELL equipment. Luckily I bought the extended warrantee.,2
71423,What a waste of money. This thing is huge pain to assemble and it is just continuously falling apart. If you touch it even slightly wrong the whole thing falls apart. Don't store anything valuable on this. Very flimsy and weak.,2
67294,I was disappointed in both the small size and the thinness of the product. It seems cheaply made,2

41833,"I was hoping the 2x coverage ment that it would cover finished wood well, but it does not. The texture of the finished wood leaves the grain unpainted. I tried 3 coats to get the basic coverage needed, which is not economical or time saving. Might be best for plastic or metal painting. Won't buy again.",2
69660,"I did not like the smell. The lavender smell was overwhelming. It seems that there are two different scents called lavender: one is mild, which I love, the other is offensively pungent, which I do not care for. This mist uses the second kind.",2
67231,"I purchased this blender in July at $90. Looks nice, has plenty of attachments and seemed like a good deal. Used twice a month, it worked fine. Around 6 months in, I began to make smoothies daily. Sometimes twice a day. After a month of this frequent use the motor began grinding and making the screw that holds the attachments come off mid-use. I went online and read how to tighten it up and did that. It lasts a day or two between tightening sand you have to hold the blender or cup on tight so it doesn’t fall off. When I called about the warranty, I was told to find a box to pack it, drive it to a drop off location and once they received it back they would send another. About a 2 week turn around. Because I use this daily, I will be just replacing it instead of dealing with the hassle and I won’t use this brand again.",2
