127855,Makes greAt coffee but coffeemaker does not allow your hand to get into that coffee pot to clean it; therefore coffee residue stays in bottom of pot. I like the attachment that removes chlorine from the Warne. Auto brew timer is a great feature.,4
152307,It's everything it says it is.... Works perfect for us!!!!,4
120267,"Well in the picture it says it has 2 vibrators when it really has only one. Other than that it's light and very versatile, I use it for my herniated disc and my epicondylitis and it's great that it's wireless cos I can take it with me to trips and restaurants and stuff. I just think the publicity has to be more accurate. It wouldn't hurt if it really had 2 vibrating points, and better yet, that not only the middle part vibrated but all 3 sections we're functional. Just an idea for Homedics.",4
130126,I like this book. Glad Rebecca and Alex realized that they love one another. Sad that Heather had such hate for Rebecca that she would hurt people,4
156282,This pot is on point. Very good. No sticking.very easy to clean and cooks perfectly fine,4
133660,"These fit well and are very comfortable but are rather frail. Best hand washed or, as last resort, washed on delicate/cold water in the washing machine. Do not dry in the clothes drier if that can be avoided.",4
157316,"Not really a blue light at night, more like a yellow white light. Still, it's better than nothing.",4
141204,"I was skeptical but my better half ordered two of these. We made use of the suggestions from other people who bought these and gave them a good review. Very sturdy. We put them together with the addition of gorilla glue on the pegs. We assembled them and let them sit overnight to let the adhesives dry and do their job. The cranky comments from people who didn't follow the instructions, moving the item right after assembly, not assembling them properly, etc. are tiresome. This is not heirloom furniture but it does the job if you put it together properly.",4
153551,Love the look of this costume. My daughter loves it - good for twirling! :) Only complain is cheapness of accessories - the gems on the wand fell off after 5 minutes of trying it on. Hopefully we can glue them back on.,4
153131,It is beautiful but it slide off the table a lot.,4
141379,Basement humidity is much better using this,4
147747,My daughter got this book for Christmas. It is great to be given so many ideas of things to draw. I just wish there was some sort of instruction or a picture to copy. It is literally an empty book.,4
144727,"Nice looking, appears to be well-made. Not as lightweight as I would have hoped, but perhaps it can't serve its purpose at a light weight. The tightening screws, handles, etc., are sturdy, and legs are stable. Will work well.",4
136619,"But the metal join on one side has a small snag. It isn't enough to stop me from using them, but it is noticeable as I knit. Otherwise they're great, and I like the finish on the needles--not so slick my work slides off but smooth.",4
140855,"Thought that I would stand upright for the most part, but it kind of folds over when it is full. It is durable and lightweight for taking to the laundromat",4
128778,"as advertised, loved it",4
128391,This game is a lot of fun.,4
148765,I also bought the solar ones--love it. My advice is to get the solar and not worry about batteries,4
150547,As noted in at least one other review product arrived with no top. When I have purchased this product in a pet store it has always had a top on it. This is my favorite aroma of the other colognes in this product line; last only a day or so which is disappointing.,4
124668,Love it and results!! Only thing is it was pretty messy,4
137341,Bras are very comfortable. Perfect for breastfeeding.,4
137402,"Fast-paced romance with a little magic thrown in for good measure. Not an intensely deep story, but still a fun read.",4
155376,My dog loves these treats. Just wish they were a little less expensive.,4
120130,I love these glasses. Very good quality and they look great on me. I'm happy.,4
131492,"The window of time to return this product was one month. Although the product broke one week after that return window closed, the merchant was very responsive and was able to rectify the situation by replacing the product. I’m very impressed with their professionalism and responsiveness to the matter. They are definitely customer oriented.",4
159639,"They're a little looser than I was expecting but I think I'm just in between sizes (xs and small). Overall, length is great.",4
138131,"Loving it so far, although I do feel the suction isn’t perfect but enough to do the job.",4
131197,"The bottles says to take one, three times a day. I take one a day and lets just say that has been plenty.",4
120335,Very cute! Fits the note 9 well.,4
129935,As advertised though heavy and need larger bite.,4
136014,"Almost as I expected, the picture on the case is faded and not as clear as I would've liked.",4
123297,This movie was funny however some parts didnt play well,4
155661,"Using this in my work computer for meetings instead of those ugly and uncomfortable headsets with the arm mic. The sound quality is very good, both hearing and speaking (with the mic)",4
125507,"Great material, I have washed it twice with no problems and no wrinkles.",4
138976,Is good quality for a great price.,4
140632,"Sleeve offers great compression, really helps my tendonitis. Gave 4 stars because the copper healthy emblem and print started wearing off on 2nd days and looked really bad. After a few days was worn enough to peel the rest. Other than that I highly recommend.",4
147442,Great item. Price is right! Just exactly what I needed!!! Super cute,4
130874,Adult wipes. Larger than those purchased in 99 cent store,4
139913,Was pretty good and solid. The phone didn't work out for me so replaced it.,4
126197,Top is a little big while bottoms are a little small but still super cute.,4
141460,"Beautiful dress, just did not fit",4
151287,"I got a defective unit, but manufacturer was quick to replace it! Great for charging my Apple Watch on the go.",4
144299,"How can I replace LED, I bought this item and the light only worked for about 2 month?",4
152763,The controller functions well overall. the only negatives are that the dpad is nearly unusable and that the rubber pad on the left stick wears over time.,4
148564,"I think these are a great value if you are looking for something cute. You get a variety of cute patterns for a fantastic price, and I definitely think they are worth buying. They are made out of a soft knit cotton t-shirt like material which is just what I wanted. Just know if you want to use these to workout or just casually wear them for a long time that you may have to readjust them as they like to slip back and then off in those instances, at least on my hair which is really sleek. I also have a medium-large head so that probably plays a part. It's definitely not a deal-breaker and I am sure once I wear them more they will stretch out a bit.",4
122279,I like the magnetic capability. I wish the product came in colors. I will have to paint it and hope that it will still be durable.,4
133981,"Kind of expensive for boxes but they are good quality and shipped faster than expected. There aren’t a lot of options in this size, I recommend these!",4
140536,For indoor use only . Gravel collects around foot too much to be useful outdoors in the Desert. Insole becomes a little sticky after a few hours. Wool insole lining would be better.,4
120299,has all that is needed,4
120440,"Likes: great design, well built. Dislike: I have a tendency to want to lean slightly on the table but am afraid to with the 20 pound capacity.",4
136634,Had hubby install this weekend. Now both sides of garage roof are set to collect rain water this afternoon.,4
138637,Yes the price is steep for a print - but it is the perfect addition to our apartment.,4
155686,Good thickness to the pages but the coloring pages aren't very interesting.,4
130060,"It was cool for about 2 minutes, and then I just didn't see the draw to these. Also, if you have a wireless charger, they tend to get in the way. My wife uses them still, well, until I bought her a new case she can't use them on.",4
154537,It was a gift for my husband. He likes the color and it's very nice. Magnet isn't very strong but it holds about 10-12 bills,4
158117,"I love the ideal of stretchable lids. It goes well on pyrex glass boxes. Just make sure it is of perfect size. dishwasher safe. Do not leak but don't store liquid in container and then hope it to replace your lid. About the zip seal bags, they are ok not that great but fact that it is re-usable I have lot of use cases for organizing my fridge with them.",4
130784,"Looks nice and is good sized. However, the holder for the wipes has already ripped after 2 months of use and when you put a small stack of wipes, it does not close. The closing strap needs to be long and the magnet needs to be stronger.",4
143442,It only worked for about 3 months and stopped working,4
124522,A bit large for a size 8. But it shines so nice!! Looks great. It’s a tad brighter and lighter than my real diamonds but perhaps with wear it’ll settle in. Looks great with my real diamonds! Love it.,4
158467,"I’m 5’5 and bought a Large. Pros: the price, lightweight fabric, very breathable. Cons: top is pretty thin shows bra, stripes are more like a bright red, and the sleeve length is a little too long for me. Mine did come with the belt and pockets.",4
151715,"My end table is metal, so the magnet works great, especially when my wife goes to sleep and I have to turn off my bedside lamp. Yet to be used for work projects.",4
125100,We got these for our living room table. They go well with our decor and they are great for the price (added bonus that it comes with a holder). Bottomline - they do the job while looking great,4
140771,"This rug pad is a good value for the money. Product was as represented and advertised. I would order a thicker size next time--but that was my issue, I got what I ordered and recommend.",4
155054,"There are pros and cons to this product. Pros: it works well; I can see my kids while they sleep; the monitor let's me know when it needs to charge; I like that there is a music button, with the VOX setting, the screen turns off when kids are quiet which preserves battery life; it gives us the option to mount to the wall with 2 holes on the back; it does not connect to WiFi which prevents hackers, so keeps my kids safe; it has volume controls and I can talk to my kids through the monitor which is great when I see them doing something they should not; the monitor for my kids room can twist different ways which is great when mounting. Cons: the screen is small; picture quality is not so great; because of the piece that stands the parent up and the charging cable, it can be awkward to stand up; the volume is not very loud; even though it's given the option to mount, no screws come with it to mount; the speaker control is not great and sometimes my kids can't hear me through it; it only sometimes beeps when the kids monitor gets unplugged. I've given it a 4 because for the most part it does it's job and it's good for what I need it for and that is to be a second monitor to the one of a different brand that I already have. It's not as good as my other one, but it works.",4
122265,Super cute! Just a little smaller than I thought.,4
151095,"I bought these because I needed to keep the moisture down in a few rooms. Mold tends to grow. So far, they are absorbing the moisture and I haven’t seen any mold. I do not smell any of the lavender vanilla scent, but it serves its main purpose.",4
139497,These require that you add your own lead wires; they don't have a square pin on the back like some others.,4
139682,Don't bother with the overpriced stock filters. These are just as good and half the price. I couldn't be happier.,4
130688,"The stylus worked great for a few days. However, now when I try to use it, it does not work. I've only had it for about a week now, and I've only used it about 3 times during school. The buttons on the stylus also do not work. I do see that sometimes the stylus will work for a few seconds while I have my palm rested on the iPad but it stops working once I take my palm off. This only lasts for a few seconds even while keeping my palm on the screen. It also will not connect to my iPad anymore. The stylus is not recognized anymore when I try to pair it to my iPad. It was such a great product at first, so I don't see how it is not working anymore. Update: I contacted the seller regarding a refund and I was granted one with no hassle. I’ve had the new one for months now and it works great!",4
139942,"Not had to put it together, took me an hr, it blends well in my baby’s room",4
151488,"It's really outstanding book. Comparing this book with other book it will be foolish, because you can find the exact information in this book, I'm pretty sure that you will not find any book like this one , It will be very difficult. I highly recommend this book.",4
128998,"the taste is very sweet! the sizing is a bit smaller than expected, but it’s still pretty decent! i would recommend it to anyone who loves honeycomb! 8/10 !",4
140066,I 'd like to see the sides a little higher. We use it to play Canasta.,4
129009,"These diapers are adorable, and are a great price compared to others. After doing some research, these have been highly rated for durability. I unfortunately have not had the chance to use these yet, as they are way to big for my 7 lb newborn. We are using disposable diapers until he can fit in these, which is a little disappointing as we were hoping to avoid disposables this time around, but it's not the end of the world. I have given this 4 stars because I haven't been able to actually try them out due to the fact they do not fit newborns as advertised. Due to the size of these diapers, I anticipate we won't get to use them for at least another few months. I will update my review when we get a chance to use them.",4
127478,Item was canceled never received need credit,4
142418,"These were a little heavier than I expected but, the kids seemed to enjoy!",4
141963,This book contained many cliches pertaining to black people. All in all that didn't overpower the valuable resources given out throughout the book .,4
147697,Liked the size and that the battery life is pretty good.,4
129708,Engaging fleshed out characters. An enjoyable book for a romance. Head and shoulders above other writers in the romance genre.,4
121967,"I buy this tea for my father-in-law who is more of a coffee drinker and isn't fussy about tea. I personally find it fairly harsh and not a soothing beverage. Organic teas that cost more tend to have a better flavor and go down better, even black. Still for the price, it's not bad.",4
152699,"This dress fits well, have to size down tho.",4
147256,"Just want to thank the seller for thier great costumer service..had an issue with battery not staying changed,contacted seller and they send me replacement battery right way...so now laptop seems its working as it should. So super duper happy with the purchases...thanks",4
132762,"When I purchased this I didn’t see the disclaimer about it not fitting some coffee makers. I have a Bunn and the filter is too small. However, I decided to try it anyway and so far it’s working just fine. I hardly ever make a full pot, so the grounds don’t over flow and there is very little sediment in the bottom of the pot. I’m satisfied.",4
156161,Good product. Easy installation. Just what we needed.,4
132246,"Great style, like the fit - only drawback is the fasteners - they come apart",4
137271,be sides the colour the jacket was all I wanted,4
156859,It relatively easy to replace and seems to be working out. I will keep you posted on the durability.,4
155155,"Works well, but you need to figure out the correct flow rate. Test these out prior to your trip for best results.",4
152795,Very good Requires minimum effort . Used only once but I’m pleased with my purchase,4
155261,Good shirt but shrinks an entire size.,4
139838,"Good One, but not his best. Make it a great one Stone wins the day with Lances help Happy reading",4
142413,"Wasn't that bad to put together, just took a bit of time. One board did come without a few of the main holes drilled though. In the end it's a decent table and gets used quite a bit.",4

136816,Very nice item are use it all the time,4
135006,Perfect for around the house. Must wear with thick socks tho because they feel like tiny needles without socks.,4
155525,Great product with fast delivery!,4
142571,Using to feed a beta with the small round beta pellets. Tested it out before installing on the tank. Works good on 24 and 12 hour feeding. Pellet food is very small and it was a little tricky to adjust food release. Instructions are in Chinese none in English. If I didn’t have something like this before I would have been in trouble. It is still new so we will have to see how it performs in future,4
141875,This is the second set of these I've had..and the motor has quit in one of them each time. Guess I will have to send these back too. So disappointed. Edited to add: I am going to change this to a 4 star as the seller has contacted me with an offer of a refund and replacement product. This kind of offer goes a long way with me and hopefully the new set works well.,4
158053,"This is to replace a similar product which I lost, and it appears to be equally waterproof.Tried the leak test seems to look good slight condensation around the edge at the top but I'm sure that will be ok as tissue inside was bone dry.Using for a holiday looks sturdy thanks.Tested these whilst in the garden pool and they worked brilliantly..",4
127951,Love it! Looks great and holds flower pot well just wish they had a little more room between bottom and top shelves.,4
147202,A long book but reads quickly. Writing is clear. Naval action tied to its effect on and participation in the land war. A good introduction to the naval history of the era. More photos would have welcome. Maps are clear but in tiny print in this edition. An accompanying atlas of WWII naval battles would help the reader understand maneuvers and strategy. Recommended.,4

136314,Great quality for the price. Works well with any action cam that has a tripod mount,4
123222,"These socks provide great compression. They do the job and my feet/legs feel great after the end of a 12hr shift. They are thick near the foot which provides great cushion. I have 2 complaints. 1) the foot/toe part of the socks are very wide. Which can make it difficult to fit into well-fitting tennis shoes. 2) The band are the top can be very tight. I end up having to roll it down by the ned of the day. Overall, great compression. Wide toes. Thick sock with cushion",4
150876,Product has potential to be a five star product. The only issue was the stitching along the main zipper started coming off immediately after the first use. Overall satisfied.,4
145700,"The ""but"" here is because I should have ordered the wider banded one made by the same excellent company. The thin band put a little too much pressure on my waist. I love this company, though. I own about 5 different leggings that they make.",4
158177,"Great fit on my shower door. Easy to install once I figured out the proper arrangement of adapters, gasket and screws. Could have included instructions to make it easier but not to difficult with some understanding of how the opening needs to seal.",4
125524,"Very easy to install. It is reversible, so you get much longer useful life.",4
130038,Portable little recorder and works as it's expected. Buttons make it easier to operate than just menu options like some other models.,4
131592,This bag looks amazing....my daughter loves it! The problem I've had with it is the neoprene bags do not work well to keep a cold temperature. Every day her large ice pack is melted and everything in the bag is at room temp.,4
154504,"loose on my small 250cc honda rebel. but the included buckle straps are a HUGE plus to make sure it doesn't get blown off the bike in the wind! I used to need to wrap a large bungee cord around the bike in a couple spots to keep my covers from being blown off the bike, specially in storms, this one has held strong for a couple weeks now without any current signs of breaking. this is a CHEAP cover however, don't hold high expectations for longevity of the cover. it's not super thick and will break if continued to be used as I am currently using it!",4
154261,"This works well to help organize cosmetics and jewelry, particularly given limited storage space in the bathroom. It appears to be well made and is easy to stack, although the drawers can be a tad sticky. I am using the bottom three tiers on my dresser, to store jewelry, and the top levels in the bathroom, to store cosmetics. I like the versatility that you can separate the pieces and stack them as necessary Why four stars instead of five? I wish it were a little larger, and I wish that there were deeper compartments on the top for storing brushes and pencil eye and lip liners.",4
138653,"The antennas work good, once you get them installed and set up your TV to scan channels the video is good. Depending where you have it set up, the picture quality and/or channel availability will have an impact on what is available for reception. By extending them to the maximum height or on/by the windows is even better for viewing your maximum channels that are available in your area. Does the job and the price is good as well.",4
127123,Good seller. Would do business with again.,4
146245,I love the diamond picture. Some of the symbols are really hard to make out( an example is a white symbol on a light gray background). There are 3 different ones in this picture. I am having to use a magnifying glass. Plus all the colors are really close in color. It is going to be spectacular..I was short some beads in one color and the seller was very quick to respond.,4
134130,"What I really enjoy about this duvet cover is how soft the material is and the comfort you get when you touch it. I've had some duvet covers that are simply not good, they are all crunchy and sleeping under them is a nightmare. This one also comes with matching pillow cases and I really like how you can tie the duvet down to the corners.",4

I can lift a 20 lb bag of cat food (not that I do it often, but it's possible for me to do without issue). in comparison, this was a nightmare. I'm using it as a grow light, not for a workshop, so I have no experience with work lights. So the word clamp has specific connotations... They DO NOT INCLUDE, that they must be twisted TOGETHER TO close. It's not like a hair clip, like a regular clamp. I figured id attach it to the shelf above to keep it upright by CLAMPING it on.. You know, like a CLAMP. YOU CAN'T. it needs to hang from a pole. a freaking pole. it's basically the equivalent of a stronger twist tie that will supply power to a bulb. it's cheap - in price, looks and construction. So the only people who will be able to find this useable are those very strong, with freaking POLES!",1

37654,Had to constantly change battery. Worked sometimes,1
15250,"This is the worst scale I've ever owned. I can step on the scale without clothes and then again fully clothed and weigh the exact same thing. It's almost like this scale remembers your last weight and if it's close, just displays the same thing over and over. Other scales I've had in the past are so accurate that you can literally see an ounce difference when you add or remove weight. DO NOT buy this thing if you are weighing in daily or keeping close track of your weight. All it is good for is a generalized number and is definitely not accurate!",1

He felt so bad he didn't even charge me, but he recommended a local watch shop about a mile away. I went there - and he, too, couldn't get the back on the watch. I went to a THIRD watch shop - same story. Then, in desperation, I emailed Timex who said I'd hear from someone within 24 hours - that was almost three days ago. So that's it - I'm done.

The length of the magnet is fairly short. Once I was able to adhere the magnets, I was shocked at how comfortable they were on. However, because the length of the magnet is so short, the lashes look like they were hanging on for dear life. It's like when you wear false lashes and one of the corners doesn't stay on so you have that lash peeking out. I may have to cut them, but I think they will end up looking like corner lashes instead of full lashes. I think with better practice, this may work out for me BUT it might take more magnetic lashes since you have to be extremely gentle with them or else they start to fray/peel off the band and lose its original form. Also, to clarify, you get 8 pieces but they're only 2 pairs of magnetic lashes (2 pieces for each eye), not 8 pairs of magnetic lashes.",3

81862,"This little vacuum is a good value. The main attachment is good for cleaning up pet hair or crumbs--there's suction on the top and bottom so it's great to stick in corners or behind couch cushions, etc. I keep it in my car to vacuum the seats and other nooks and crannies. But it's not the best on flat/hard surfaces. It's also not the best at getting dust if you don't attach the hose. The exhaust on the sides it really intense and might blow the dust away before you have a chance to vacuum it up. Also, if you don't empty the canister after every use or keep it upright, the dirt/hair/dust can just fall right out again. Finally, it's very loud. But for the price, it gets the job done and I'm pretty happy with it.",3

93535,I love my pink work gloves. I work construction most days of the week and need some work gloves that will hold up and last. These are not them. The first pair I purchased ripped on the index finger after about 4 months. I figured that was okay because I am so hard on them. I ordered a second pair and they only lasted me about 6 weeks before the index finger ripped again. I need a glove that can handle real work. Doesn’t anyone make a tough pink work glove? I can’t be the only woman construction worker out there that wants pink work gloves!,3

192343,I was so pleasantly surprised with my husband's pick of this cap for me. Even the description makes it sound fun as it is. Good for a young or older person as I can attest to.

188120,"This toothpaste is pretty great! I must say at first I was a little hesitant using a black toothpaste. I have been wanting to try activated charcoal and this seemed like the perfect option. Less chemicals than normal toothpastes and has probiotics for healthier teeth! For me personally, I like extreme minty feeling after brushing, this does not leave that however, I have noticed a remarkable difference in how my mouth tastes when I wake up! So while the initial feeling is not as minty, I have better breath after extended times. Does not foam like your typical toothpaste however, you brush in the same way! Excited to see extended results!",5

160295,For the price cant go wrong. Ive only had it a short time so cannot make statement regarding its longevity.,5
183357,Works well have noticed a difference in just the first 2 days my dog will start to bark then the coller seems to confuse her and she gets distracted and forgets what she was barking at. The unit itself is a nice size not too bulky my dog is 35 lbs and rather small she doesnt even seem to notice the box. Display is easy to read and all the functions are on one button and easy to change sensitivity and mode settings. I love that it has the option for no shock and a shock option. The product will beep for a few seconds vibrate twice then give a small static shock when in shock mode. Very light shock ive had worse in the winter from a blanket but enough to discourage the dog from barking. In no shock mode the unit will beep and vibrate only. I plan to use shock mode at first then transition into the no shock. I like that it allows you to do this by keeping the beeps and vibrations before the shock once trained the beep will be enough to stop the behavior without needing the added correction of the shock. The collars provided are easy to slip into the main unit while not recommended for tie out or walking are nicely made the nylon one has a well fastening plastic buckle and the plastic one has a belt clip and holes. Both are reflective as well so that is an added bonus. Took her for a swim and the unit survived so it does seem to be waterproof as well,5
175133,IF FIT PERFECTLY. SHE LIKES IT VERY MUCH.,5
191712,We use this outside at the pool to watch movies at night. Plenty bright. Would recommend for thos application.,5

191695,I am so impressed with this dress. The fabric is so soft and stretchy but doesn’t go sheer when stretched. It’s is true to size for US sizing which seems hard to find these days.

161868,"I was skeptical about this. I didn't think it would get as heat as a real dryer, but it sure does! I have thick, curly hair. I used flexi-rods and my hair set perfectly. They recommend drying for 20-30 minutes, however if you have a lot of hair, you know you have to stay under longer. What I did was took breaks, and in total used it for about an hour and 15 minutes.

199547,Love love love this. I am 115 lbs 5’3. I have a larger bottom half and a flat chest. The skirt was perfect and sexy. The top was a bit large around the rib cage being a 32A but put on a busty strapless bra and it fills it out a little more! It’s SO comfy and great quality,5

173781,"I use these daily, and they work well. I really wasn't sure what to expect at this price point, but these were definitely worth the cost, and make the case that spending more would be a waste. I do have to say that they're pretty fragile-feeling, but they give no sign of breaking.",5

62893,"These did not work out for me at all. I wear a Women's size 10 medium and these were too small and cramped my toes. The fabric made my feet feel very hot too. I did like how they don't slip around your foot though. Because they were too small for a Women's 10, I returned them.",2
79853,For the price I figured they wouldn’t be as good as the more expensive ones but they are made of extremely thin sheet metal. Have a 1-2” gap around them and do not even include rubber for the edges just a foam round foam sticky pad for the bottom corner. If you aren’t looking for quality or a tight fitting door then these are for you! If you want something that actually seals up the lowers then purchase a different product,2

45348,The product is very miss leading of the size they are nowhere near what it looks like in the picture. Definitely read the description the pieces were no long that 16 inches and less than a 1/2 inch thick. Better for a small 10 gallon,2

67782,No matter what I do I cannot get these to stay in my ears. I've almost run the lawn mower over them coz they keep falling out. So now they just sit in a drawer. Big waste of money.,2
75651,They are soggy after toasting. I tried to fix that by adding more time to the toasting but they just came out dry and difficult to eat. They also fall apart while trying to eat them. You'll need a spoon... I can get better waffles.,2
54732,"Pillow Cover slick and not a typical pillow material. Would NOT recommend. The REAL Better Homes and Garden pillow from Walmart that has insert included and not just a cover has a cost of $2.00 more and is worth the money, NOT this pillow COVER. DO NOT RECOMMEND this seller's pillow cover at all.",2
45813,Silicon portion does not quite fit and I'm very disappointed that you cant put the phone in the holster with the screen facing out. The picture shows the holster being used as a kickstand but you can't actually do that because the phone wont lock in screen facing out. Also I bought two of these in different colors and they are not even close to the same case.,2

78954,These claim to be hypoallergenic but I don’t believe they are. I have very sensitive ears so I’m very cautious about purchasing random earrings. I read the reviews and decided to give these a go. The INSTANT I put theb in my ears my ear holes ached! I took them out immediately. I have since painted the studs with clear fingernail polish and that seems to be keeping the irritation at bay.,2

I let it soak per directions, longer than required and shorter periods. It does not remove the letters even with a lot of scraping. I removed the letters with a heat gun. The adhesive left behind did come off with the product. Very disappointed. Not worth the high price. Would not recommend for vinyl letter removal.",2

However, less than two years after purchasing, heavy use with my Ryobi brushless trimmer caused the batteries to overheat and the area around the contacts melted. Almost ruined my trimmer, as one of the batteries almost wouldn't come out. Neither are currently functional. I have purchased 4 of these, as I gave two to my son-in-law as a gift. I also own some of the actual Ryobi batteries which I have owned for years, and have had no problem. I can't recommend Energup at this point, unless you are only doing light-duty stuff.",2

That being said now that I’ve had them for some time and haven’t really used them very hard. Just mainly a few hours a week.

Tried it at the grocery store and the scanner couldn’t read the screen. The film is also very dark, which doesn’t look good on my white phone. Finally, the surface isn’t perfectly smooth and has an uneven texture to it. It was easy to install, but that is the only thing I liked.",2

We had initially thought it was great, but are now very disappointed.",2

49671,"Used six of these on a recent family trip. Four flights later, two of them were bent. They are made of some sort of metal, maybe aluminum, and if they get tossed around or mangled in the luggage processing facility they will bend. The idea is good - I like only being able to see your name on the info card and your address and phone number covered but having them bent up after only one use? They need to change the material to a silicone or leather type of material that can handle being tossed around by man and machine.",2

58386,"The back of the case is nice, slicker than I thought which is fine, still comfortable, but the overall materials (rubber/plastic casing) is pretty flimsy. Though the most important feature, the lip for the glass screen, is just too short by a mm or 2. So, if you use a glass screen protector, like zagg, when putting phone face down, you will be sitting on the glass, not on the case's lip. Also, I dont believe that if this phone was dropped that it would actually do much for protection. I was under the impression this would be a bit more rigid, like incipio or incase. Full edge shock protection is quite a stretch.",2

76244,Actually I have had nothing but trouble replacing a strand of lights from the one's I bought last year. I have now bought quite a few that did not match.,2
74377,"First, this product did not fit my 2004 Honda CRV, as advertised, without cutting off the tow hook, a task I couldn't have completed if I was trying to install this at home. Secondly, the day after installation we loaded a bike rack and a single bike onto the hitch, only for the back driver side bolt to immediately shear off. When I contacted the company, they were polite but unable to answer my question about the size or grade of the bolt. We ended up going to Uhaul who generously gave us some of the extra carriage bolts and accompanying rectangular plates. All of those bolts were at least a grade five. The bolts in this package are not labeled with markings to suggest what grade they are. I ended up asking the Pep Boys crew who installed to replace all the bolts, and in addition to the one sheared bolt, there was etching along the others, suggesting that they too were weakening. While my situation is now under control, this hitch caused quite a few extra headaches, and I would be wary about trusting that it fits the vehicles it claims to fit and that the quality is sufficient to hold even a minor load.",2

68895,The orbits do not get big at all the bottle they came in is very small!,2
44511,"I purchased thos fishing tackle kit, however I did not realise how small the kit is. Unable to use it will keep it in storage.",2
76487,"The fit is to put it in the words of my wife, ""old man pants"". Which just means it was very baggy in the wrong places. Compared to other pants purchased that are regular fit, it appeared too lose. However the fit with regards to size appeared to be accurate as the waist and length was correct, just the style appeared outdated. To be clear, I'm not comparing the fit to ""slim fit"" type styles. I'm comparing to regular fit as I had ordered these for work. We have business casual but wear ties, no coat or jacket. I'm hopeful this will be updated as the price is very economical and I purchase these with the attitude it's a uniform.",2
66766,The design makes it very hard to wash baby's lower body,2

56262,"The design I got was pretty cute, it’s the black one with the stars on it. Unfortunately, it’s cheaply made, because one week after use, the black started rubbing off and you can see the white underneath. Also in the photos, you can see on the edges it’s starting to break. Overall wouldn’t recommend. You can get a much better quality one for a few dollars more.",2
57899,They are cute in person. I bought the xl and they fit my daughter who is a size 4/5. Very disappointed in fit.,2

50017,Didn't fit well. Pops up in the middle which makes it difficult to text.,2
48186,"I have two very specific things that I HATE about this clock. (1) The most dim display setting is still tremendously too bright. It lights up the entire room and (2) when you wake to radio you can not turn the volume down to wake you more gently. The radio comes on quietly for about 5 seconds and then becomes significantly too loud. When I read the directions, it says that the wake to radio volume setting can't be turned down, because they do not want you to inadvertently set it to no sound at all (and thus not wake you up). I appreciate the need for a minimum sound setting, but it should be one third of what it is now. You must turn off the radio once it wakes you up, because no one would ever want it this loud. BUT, the clock LOOKS cool, the time sets itself, there is a cool USB charger for your phone. Still the two flaws listed above make this a clock radio that I would not recommend.",2

61238,Cheap product broken after one week of use...,2
71465,"It looks great and is reasonably well made. But I'm sending it back for three reasons. It smells like mold. The zipper is sewn in a way that the edge of zipper gets caught in the teeth as you zip it up. Super annoying. Strap is sadly too short. I guess I fall into the ""particularly burly"" category, as the product description cautions. I'm 5ft 9in and 185 lbs. Worn across the body the bag is at the level of my stomach.",2
79218,I'm really bummed. I was excited thinking I got a good deal read the good reviews but this product didnt work. and tended to hurt my teeth 😔,2
71925,Yes it pumped water. The tether was too short to keep a consistent contact to run the pump. But when it does run it doesn't shut off when the water is gone. Returning it.,2

61882,Would be great if it wasn’t so lightweight and cheap that the pieces fall over constantly.,2
78069,Packaging came in fine but once we tried it on ourselves the staple on the side barely held. We actually wasn’t able to use this at all for our Pirate Party. Bummer because the quality and colors looked great. However once you try to assemble it just doesn’t hold up . Maybe you can try it on yourself and tape it on the side? Or you can try re-stapling the whole set again..,2

69983,"I purchased this toaster after reading many reviews of the Oster 2-Slice toaster in hopes that this would deliver the same quality toasting. IT DOES NOT!

62251,The plot was really weak. It was like watching a cheap Hollywood movie where nothing in the plot surprises.,2
41146,"I don't know how they can list up to 16 mile range. We just used these for a drive from Florida to Pennsylvania. It probably should say range of 1.6 miles. It definitely did not have over a 2 mile range. If you were close to the other car they worked fine, but honestly anything over a mile was bad or not at all. These did not meet my need for them at all.",2
