53966,product material and style is perfect but is sizing is not perfect,2
43942,My puppy has shown little interest in this toy and it was smaller than expected. I would recommend for super small/young puppies. Not for medium puppies over 10 weeks old.,2
44691,While I really appreciated the fine mesh on this. After a couple months of semi regular use the spot welds that hold the arms on fell apart. Booo...,2
44934,Three months later and the heel fell off completely in middle of school.,2
71227,"Not sure whether they are old stock or just cheap cells, but the batteries Didn't even last a month before I noticed they were already blinking red. Went ahead and ordered from Invisible fence, even though they are 3x the cost of these they last at least 3x as long and I don't have to worry about my dogs getting out because of a bad battery.",2

166022,"I wanted to find a large number alarm clock. This isn't a name brand, so I was hesitant to purchase it, but I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. Projection is clear and can be adjusted as needed. This is truly great.",5
160214,I bought this one as a backup as binding tends to wear down. But I have another one like this and I've had four 5 months. Still works great.,5
189585,Very cute. My wife loves them. They are raised and have a great look.,5
187013,"This is very pretty, the abalone has good qualities. The chain is as it looks in the picture and is a very strong and attractive chain. This pendant is fairly large, check the measurements. Some things are made to look big and are quite small. This is a decent size.",5

175765,"I cannot get enough of this series. These books are funny, suspenseful, exciting and sweet. On to the next one!",5
186932,"Worked good, she got horny quicker lol",5
1508,Absolute horrible. Tips broke off of all cords within a month.,1
23224,"I bought this for my daughter as a first straw cup however, she can’t even use it. The straw is too short and doesn’t even reach the bottom of the cup rendering it useless. I would avoid purchasing.",1
29913,"I normally don't write reviews but I am incredibly upset at the quality of these headphones. Within two months of ownership, the headphones died suddenly. They will not charge or turn on. They are still in otherwise perfect condition and have not experienced any damage whatsoever. Do not purchase these and expect a long lifetime. Sennheiser is also incredibly difficult to work with regarding the warranty. Look elsewhere if you plan on spending this much.",1
28000,Don’t think I can write a review because I never got what I paid for.,1
13439,I haven't received it yet,1
34750,Don't but this.. In 3-5 months the battery is useless and the company is no Help,1
29406,The case is almost an inch too big for the galaxy tabs. Doesn’t fit at all,1
24841,"This is delicious jam, and I frequently buy it for my husband. However, both jars were broken. Although they were wrapped in bubble wrap, they were sent in a lightly padded envelope instead of a box. Now I have to try to get my money back. Let's see if this company stands by their service.",1
153555,"Not very consistent in elastic stretch/size, but very cute!",4
121493,2 reasons for 4 star first is it's too white. That might sound silly but it's even whiter than the face plate it comes with it so white it's extremely noticeable. Second it's really loud it ticks like an old dang clock.,4
129694,Good looking product.,4
155657,Don’t expect to fit a lot in here . It’s a little smaller than expected it will do for short hikes.,4
130384,The purse could have been a little larger. But basically like it.,4
137590,"Thought it would have more of an orange flavor, thus 4 stars. Tastes more grapefruit like. Was impressed with how I felt the day after a heavy workout. I was not as sore and tired like I normally would be. BCAA was the only new item I added so it had to be that.",4
155178,"SHORT AND CLEAN ROMANCE. IT WAS A LITTLE TOO BRIEF, AND TOTALLY IMPLAUSIBLE, BUT I STILL LIKED IT. I WOULD READ MORE BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR.",4
159751,"Well it works great, and is the best doggy dental solution I've found so far. The only problem is my dog chews the wrong end because it's easier to bite pieces off. If only it were double sided instead of having the cute handle.",4
85356,"It is okay, but it's not exactly what I should have ordered.",3
95722,"great product, but as like almost every other brand, their lightest color was still too dark for me",3
88455,My product arrived one was open and it spilled all over the box! :(,3
82238,"Bought to try. Works surprisingly well. Wish it was larger, considering the price.",3
101885,"The collar works, but the prongs must be situated right under the dog's mouth. If it strays even a half inch in either direction, the collar doesn't detect any barking - even on the highest sensitivity level. I have the collar really tight and it still swivels. I'm afraid to make it any tighter. The prongs are already digging into him.",3
97292,It wasn’t as good as I thought it would be. The side doesn’t hold it in real well,3
83966,"Does not last as long as I expected, particularly in the heat! Works well for a couple hours though.",3
90234,it was a little tart..,3
