199658,"I purchased this tracker due to my daughter being a new driver and concerns about her safety. It took seconds to install and I am not a tech wiz. I dowloaded the app to my phone and can also track using my laptop. Within minutes from installation, the tracker synced with the app and I was able to track her car. It allows me to see her speed, received notifications if there is sharp turning or braking, and also provides a history of where she has been. I can get exact coordinates of her location and times which has already come in handy in a big way. We received a call from the police department that there was an accident and the person who was driving hit another vehicle and drove away. The vehicle was similar to my daughter's and she was in the same town when the accident occurred! I was able to pull up the tracking history and see she was not in the same location where the accident occurred at that time through the tracker. Also, her vehicle did not show any damage thankfully. The tracker saved us a lot of hassle and concern. PS She is unaware the tracker is on her vehicle. If for some reason it is removed, we would be notified as well as the unit will send a message that it has been tampered with. Overall, very pleased with this product.",5

Took a chance on the small and looked hella amazing in it! My arms felt comfortable, and I was able to keep them on without cutting it like follower customers have stated.

This gives you a sense of relief and a calmness that a lot of other vitamins and pills I have taken have not. Not only did it make me feel calm but it also has made me feel less depressed and has made me able to live a better quality life. Usually I toss and turn to fall asleep and this has significantly decreased the time it takes to fall asleep and stay asleep. The pills are easy to swallow and does not have a nasty aftertaste.

9733,In December I purchased two LxTek five pack 952XL in anticipation of a planned distribution for a small nonprofit mission group that i work with. After some delay the printed project got underway. When printing began I discovered that only one out of the four 952XL black cartridge was functional. A 75% failure rate is much too high for any product. Unfortunately due to the delays in the project my time for recourse through Amazon Prime also passed. I love the idea of reused/re-manufactured cartridges but there should be some checks on re-usability before marketing.,1
16382,"Bought in October...Burned up in January. The blender worked great....until it didn't. It was used once a day from October to January. Each morning, I made a Rocket-Fuel Latte. No ice, no nuts, nothing dense. One morning, it began to make funny noises, the blender slowed down, and as I turned it off, it began to smoke and produce a very odd smell. Braun customer service seems to be set up to deny claims. I still don't have a new blender-- they only want to give me the bottom part, but the things that turn the blades are locked up, too. Still in limbo using a cheap blender from WalMart.",1

5685,Not worth a buck. Just awful.,1
29395,"Definitely not what I thought I was getting. It does not cover as much as the pictures show (and I have a short torso), it rolls down, and didn't smooth or flatten anything. Instead it made me look round and pregnant. I ordered a 3X and you can tell they are made for smaller people, not truly for bigger girls that have a little more to smooth out. Very disappointed.",1
30774,Horrid product. So disappointed that I chose this over a new iPad. iBooks (iPad) Have much better features and you don't have to deal with crappy advertising blasted all over the home screen as the fire tablet apparently does. Bought another for gift and am embarrased to give it now.,1
37991,"I contacted the seller and will update this once they respond...if they do. I ordered two strands of lights. On the first one, the last 3 feet didn't light up. This was annoying, but I was planning to hide that portion of the lights anyway. On the second strand, ONLY the first 6 feet lit up. That means almost 90 feet DIDN'T.",1

13902,The worst water jug I've ever bought. After 3 uses the lid no longer screws onto the bottle. Making the jug utterly useless. I recommend you look elsewhere for a water jug.,1
13889,Instructions are not clear! While following the manual one of the panels which were screwed on one end but not the other fell and so it snapped!,1

16490,"Cheaply made. Shoe glue all over sides of sole. A found a string hanging, I went to rip it off and it started unraveling the inside of the shoe! Worst shoes I’ve ever bought. Not comfortable at all. I bought because someone said she was a nurse and wore them with no pain during clinicals... I don’t know how. No arch support at all. Don’t waste your money",1

27135,This was a BOXED SET. Supposedly with multiple books. I paid full price for the set and only received one paper back. Very deceitful. Dont buy from this seller.,1
17161,"This is the tenth book, and honestly I am finished with the series and the author. These ""books"" compare to chapters in other authors novels. Consider this, at around $3 each, if you have purchased part one to part ten, you are now in this for $30 and the story isn't finished. I purchase a novel because I want to watch the characters develop, grow, see them overcome hardship and conflict, and I want to escape into their story for however long it takes. I actually enjoy a number of authors that use multiple books to tell a story. Meghan March is a master of this. I wish Hannah the best on her literary journey but I won't be following her or her writing anymore.",1
24582,"We looked all over Amazon for a new set of luggage and finally settled on this set after comparing price and reviews. Our main concern was the durability of the set. Well our fears were realized on our 1st trip. The luggage was nice and light, rolled well, had great space inside but when we picked up our luggage at the baggage claim, the largest one was missing a wheel. It had completely ripped off of the case, exposing the fabric inside the shell. The middle one lost one of the bumpers on it's spine, exposing two metal studs. Luckily United had 2 new suitcases that they swapped out right then and there for us. It just seemed like the better way to go instead of filing a claim and purchasing this set a 2nd time. We really wanted to like the set too...pretty bummed at the quality.",1

I switched him to this gradually over the course of a week, mixing his old food and this one together. After getting to full portions of this food, he would get really bad diarrhea. I kept thinking maybe he’d eaten something else, so kept him on this food but it lasted another couple of days. I switched him cold turkey back to Blue Buffalo and immediately the next morning his stool started to improve. Not sure what he is allergic to, but he definitely didn’t tolerate this food. I’m grateful for Amazon’s return policy because this food is not cheap. I will continue to look for another alternative to Blue Buffalo.",1

The pole caps break easily. The net doesn’t even fit around the base of the trampoline. I was unable to get this assembled until my husband returned from a long trip. We just got around to putting it all together after two months. Now it doesn’t even work and parts are breaking. A waste of money. For the money we spent, I could have bought a new trampoline from Sams Club or Costco.",1

31797,Embarrassing. I am a wedding planner and bought this along with a bubble machine for a bubble send off. It literally would not blow ONE bubble with this solution. Not one. We ended up mixing dish soap with it to make it work even a little.,1
28666,I am rating this way specifically for the iPhone X. I had this exact case for my iPhone 7+ and I liked it so much that I ordered it right away for my new iPhone X. I am very disappointed that when you take the phone with the thin inner case on it does not work for wireless charging. I think anyone who makes accessories for the X should point out that it does not work with wireless charging. Unusable for me. I have two other thin cases that work fine with wireless and even the thick OtterBox does.,1
12781,Not a fan of this at all. I have worn Angel for years and can verify that this does NOT smell like the real deal. Disappointed that it is non returnable,1

18782,"I ordered these bowls from THIS listing and paid the upcharge because I liked the color scheme of the 100 year anniversary edition advertised. It matches the color scheme of my kitchen. The ones I received are different altogether. A different color glass, different color lids, and the worst part is that the set I received regularly retails for $15-20 which means I paid double for them. I'm beyond irritated that I spent the extra money on these and did not get what was advertised in the listing.",1

1395,Returned it. Inner lining is very low quality.,1
30991,Didn't work for my son. I tried everything. I followed the steps. tried over and over. I have been trying since before he was 3. He was doing good once I stopped this and now he has so many accidents a day. This did not help. It was a waste of money. Do not buy. I have potty trained 3 other children so its not that I do not know what to do.,1
6346,"I really was excited for these but unfortunately I haven't had but a month, I have only used a few times and one of them is messing up. It's choppy or statistics and then causes the earbuds to shut down and flashes red and blue. Not sure why and they came with little info. I haven't used much because they are pretty thick and don't want to stay in my ears. I read the reviews and was worried this might happen so I bought those ear buddy's to go with. But they only helped some. They still want to fall out. So I have only used a few times while at home. But as of the past week I am having a hard time getting the right one to stay on and work. Every video I played was choppy real annoying to listen to. Not sure if I should buy a replacement one or return looks like I only have till February 11th. I just didnt want to upset hubby by returning they was a gift from him. These would be awesome if just a bit smaller and of course the sound was better in the one that is messing up.",1

66584,"You get what you pay for with this record player. Turntable itself feels light and made of a thin metal. The arm is metal which is nice but the lever to adjust the needle height dosnt work, causing the needle to fall on its own. It assembles easily and plays out of the box. At lower volumes it sounds good with the included speakers but at higher volumes it falls apart, so I would only suggest to use it in smaller rooms. Also out of the box one of the speakers play much quieter than the other, after switching them and getting new wires nothing seems to work, and with no balance control on the system I may need to get new speakers all together. I wouldn’t recommend this record player, all in all very cheaply made, can’t imagine it will withstand the long term",2

76796,With all the great reviews I thought this would be a great bath bomb. Instead I found these had little to no scent to them at all. They don't fizz very well either.

I have had my 4th generation iPad since 2012 and it has always been in mint condition... until I got this cover with the keyboard. I discovered a crack on my screen this morning, and I'm pretty bummed. I've never dropped my iPad and am super gentle with it. If my iPad was newer, I'd be much more upset - but I'm just upset that I bought this cover and now my screen is cracked. I can only guess that it's because of the keyboard and no cushion in between the screen and the frame of the keyboard? Who knows.",2

I have a 400 mbS internet speed from my provider, my phone is steady at 320 mbs speed and laptop does not exceed 200 mbs speed, so, my phone is faster than the laptop. I tried getting help from Dell since at first it didn't exceed 49 mbs and they helped me get to 200, then they turned me over to the software department which sold me a package of $150, service and software. After almost 2 hours with them on phone and laptop they actually slowed my speed even more and then admitted that the laptop does not have the capacity to go any faster, I was fuming. BOTTOM LINE... NOT WORTH THE MONEY",2

45056,"I’m confused by the good reviews on this book. I will say that some of the author’s comments are good enough to assist the reader in their own reflection, but most are plain, lacking insight, and feel rushed...and some are just stupid. Take February 8th for example, where the author says “The next time someone gets upset near you - crying, yelling, breaking something, being pointed or cruel - watch how quickly this statement will stop them cold: ‘I hope this is making you feel better.’ Because, of course, it isn’t.” Face palm. There is nothing remotely Stoic about responding with sarcasm to someone who is upset. I like the structure and premise behind the book so much that I keep wanting it to get better.

They asked for first initial, last initial then middle initial and they obviously should have put the middle initial in the middle but we got ours as the last letter.

72654,I got this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old. This car is fun and fast. However during the first ten minutes of use parts broke off and we are no longer able to steer the car. He was very disappointed and so was I. I would think an offroading remote control car would be plenty more durable but this is car is very fragile and parts break easily. I'm sending it back for a refund.,2

One of the male customers on Amazon gave feedback and called it a nut and bolt and he is exactly right i thought he was just joking when I read his review. He was not joking at all. This little device has a little bolt and you screw the back on. It will not even leave a tiny hole in your garment, it will damage your garment and leave a large hole in it. I telephone the company and told them that it is regulation size and the eagle globe and anchor look really good,but the back of this device is not for a collar. Do yourself a favor as I will do, go to an Army surplus store in your area and all the branches are there. The lady that I spoke to at this company didn't really give a rip. So, don't waste your money or time to return to Amazon, which I did without any problems from Amazon, and I got my money back.",2

My ISP replaced the wifi router and I'm still having problems with the lamp. Today I plugged in the second lamp and it works without any problems and is much brighter. Dumb me - it took 6 weeks to figure out that the the first lamp was bad and now I'm stuck with it.

While I see they tried to do a good job on the instruction manuel it's not clear enough that it explains the complicated little maneuvers to remove the screen and the little ribbon connections safely and to reattach the little covers and parts. A youtube video is a must. I don't recommend this kit. It's very easy to bend a little pin on the ribbon connector sockets and ruin your phone.

I gave 4 stars because it must be attached to a hard part of the pack and play.

Not really a big deal, works fine if you attach to hard area.",4

142611,I LOVED how easy it was to put this together. Usually my husband and I cannot be in the same room after we put furniture together this was a breeze. The only problem was that the king size frame was just a tad to small for the mattress so we just put the little part that doesn't fit at the head so it's not as noticable.,4

I was disappointed with the size of the bottle thinking that it won't last long but I only needed a small dime size to get a good lather. After drying my hair, it felt so soft and silky. I don't think it's because I changed to a different shampoo because I do that pretty regularly so that I don't get buildup from the same product. I haven't used it long enough to see if it would help with my hair loss yet. I'll update when I run out.",4

132626,"I have a young, year old cat who loves this toy. Often before bed, I toss it around, and I love the exercise he gets. I noticed he sleeps better, as well. Sometimes, I attach two of the feather bunches. One that is soft and fluffy, and the other type that is thinner and more rigid. He loves the combo. I can't fault the company for the beating the feathers take, as he is pretty rough with it. However, my frustration has been with the wand. The first one I had lasted about six months before it had issues. The second one didn't even last a month, so now I am on my third one in two months. I am giving this third one a try, and if I have the same issue, I will start looking at a competitor. I really do like the quality of the feather, which makes this choice difficult.

Remove the white paper from decal and place the decal on your desired location use credit card to smooth out and peel transfer paper off making sure your letters are flat.

Overall, nice to use. I initially reviewed this lower, but upon support from HP Customer Service, realized that my printer was shipped with an ink cartridge that was old / dried out. So the poor printing was simply a bad ink cartridge. My only criticism is that this was clearly aged inventory in Amazon's warehouse - the printer showed with a sale date that was a year ahead of my purchase (and HP nicely updated that with the warranty information) and the ink was close to it's expiration date.

120664,Very nice product no issues putting it together. Everything is solid metal. Not sure why anyone would complain about a plastic screw holding the lightning jack. It allows for stand to adjust to your case to fit on to it. Easy enough looks nice. Cords not being built into or power is a plus in my opinion. Easy enough to replace a bad cord in the future.,4

127181,"The machine is wonderful. It is fast, boots instantly and there is plenty of memory and hard disk space. I use it for engineering work (CAD and structural calculations) and it is replacing a previous two monitor HP rig. I work with two programs simultaneously and the monitor is fantastic at that. My only complaint is the input devices HP includes with it. The mouse is awful for CAD. The no-button design is a nightmare for dragging and dropping with CAD applications. It had to be replaced with a wired HP mouse. The keyboard is nice and small, but after a few weeks it started to repeat keys. I contacted, and spent a considerable time with, HP support on this issue. After the support session it improved; but after several days the key repetitions came back. So I finally replaced the keyboard with a Logitech mechanical keyboard and I am happy with it. So now the machine is a dream! I am an old school computer user and enjoy the tactile feedback of the mechanical keyboard. The fan is certainly a bit noisy; but it only turns on from time to time, so it is not a concern to me. The sound is truly better than other all in ones; but, if like me you take music seriously, get a set of external loudspeakers.",4

141855,I've used it once and overall think it's fine. I like that it's stretchy material so I can pull it up over my son's car seat. I wish it had a strap in the front so I can pull it down and block the sun from coming down through the front. I'm sure I'll find a way of using it that works for us and I like it well enough so far. I like that it's bendy material as well so I can fold and store it away.,4
122375,"The color looks natural and has covered the few grays at my temple better and longer than any color I have tried so far. I have had compliments on it's color and the conditioner leaves it feeling like silk. Easy to apply, even for an amateur like me. No burning or horrible smell. I have paid a lot more for not as satisfactory results.",4

153337,"I have used this adapter cable on both Windows 7 and Windows 10 and it works fine under both systems. Windows picked up the device on both systems, I did not need to use the included CD to load the drivers. The build quality of the cable seems good and the plastic used for the connectors is solid. My only problem with this adapter is the COM port number change each time to attach the USB port to the PC. The serial plugs have little numbered labels on them, but those don't help since the COM port numbers seem to be assigned randomly to each connector. I don't find it a hard problem to work around. I just run puTTY on each port to see which ones are talking. This works fine for my purposes, but it would be nice if the COM ports were consistent.",4

UPDATE: Joyce from customer service reached out to me and was wonderful!! I exchanged for a couple of colors, which I really like. Like I said before, I'm new to gels so I used this top coat with the Modelones color and it works well! I will try more colors in this line.",4

Also with the face mask, spectacles cloud up on very cold days--have to remove spectacles. Plastic clip between ear flaps broke in about 2 months on very cold day.",4
137577,"I read the reviews before buying this rug and noted the inconsistency in vibrancy. Some folks said the rug was more saturated than the pictures, while a few said they were disappointed by how dull the colors were. My rug arrived today and after rolling it out, I also thought it was on the dull side. But overall I liked it. The funny thing is that when I came back to the living room later in the day, the colors looked much more saturated. I thought maybe it was the difference in lighting - natural vs LED. But, after walking around the rug, I saw that the colors look different from different angles and depending on how the threads are angled. I’m attaching three photos: 1) saturated side 2) less saturated 3) less saturated after I dragged my feet across the rug in a couple areas. I’m guessing it will be more consistent if I vacuum over it? Outside of that interesting issue, it looks exactly as expected :)",4

121005,The hair out of the pack is very soft & silky. Hair has a slight smell to it (hopefully it will wash out). The bundle are very thin. Im going to buy a scale because there is no way these bundles are 100 grams. I will be updating after wash then another after install! Update: I was able to wear this hair from mid July to early September. The photos show the hair from initial install to last week on use in order. Hair comes back to life after each wash but starts to get more and more tangles. The hair sheds like crazy the hair wasn't as full as I like but was well worth the price. I will buy again,4
149098,Very nice. My wife was happy so I'm happy. We would not hesitate to purchase again.,4
137883,"I bought these pegs for a peg board that came with a work bench from Harbor Freight. The work bench itself is not the highest quality, and I was worried that the pegs wouldn’t fit correctly. I received the pegs and to my relief they fit. They do take some wiggling and force to get them into the pegboard, but they work perfectly. They are durable and sturdy enough that they hold all the tools that I have mounted with them, but pliable enough that it is possible to get them into peg boards that aren’t the highest quality. These hooks will probably outlast the work bench itself.",4
127290,I like this eye cover very comfortable. I use it every morning as day light gets through the windows. In the warm days it feels very warm and sweaty on my face as it covers almost half my face. The rubber band strap is already pretty loose and I got it not very long ago.,4

133690,"This is an excellent product. I’d consider it an almost essential when camping. Boils water in minutes. Can cook on it as well. My only complaint is the weight. It’s a lot heavier than I expected. I was expecting it on the day it arrived. When I saw a package on my porch, I picked it up and didn’t know what it was because it was much heavier than I expected. Not sure how much lighter the titanium version is but it may be worth saving up for. My pack is heavy enough without adding more weight than necessary. Remember. Everything adds up. Ounces = pounds, and pounds = pain. Keep plenty of twigs handy to get it going. And keep plenty of sticks handy once it’s lit. It does burn through sticks quickly.",4

This year was no different - stunning pictures, great size for jotting in appointments and reminders, and a good way to show support for the Club's work keeping the most beautiful parts of our country intact and available for public awe and recreation. And what a good thing I was ordering it for myself, rather than as a Christmas gift, since it arrived with crushed corners and there would not likely be time to return it and take a risk on another one.",3
85212,"Where to start ?:... it took about a month to ship, which really sucked. Once it arrived the package was very flimsy and not very protective also not discreet at all!!! It said TOY in all caps right on the package . The instructions were in Chinese but it did have separate ones In English but very small print ! So small I had to use a magnifying glass just to read them. Works how advertised but I couldn’t get the remote (which was bigger than I expected) to work until I charged everything fully for a few hours, i does have an indicator light and flashes while charging , I had to sorta plug the dc cable in just right and move it around so that I could make full contact in order for it the charge ( took me about a day to get this thing fully charged ) . Very soft and smooth texture , The head swivels in a circular motion which I didn’t even know it did, but not to be too graphic it just isn’t strong enough to do that while it’s in use , not a very powerful vibration either but it is quiet . It was an ok buy .",3

107481,So these shorts are not cut like the pictures. The leg opening is oblong from side to side. Not front to back. So you dont get that natural stretch on the side. Instead it kinda flares out. Not really flattering. The material is soft and super stretchy. I'm debating to keep it.,3
83499,I have read all the wonderful books in this family but I'm sad to say that this one was just good not great. What happened to dialogue between the couple - most of the relationship was in their thoughts not in what they said. What happened to bringing in the family members and the fun of their dialogue. What happened to make the heroine such a whiner - the constant I'm not good enough. Not to mention the contradictions on what's said in ome chapter such as the great mother that leaves her son alone overnight by himself while shes on a date. The Male characters had the alpha attitude these books are known for and that saves the book.,3

115828,Didn’t really like the case but only a personal preference issue.,3
106526,It definitely transfers files at a very fast speed for 3.0. And it is definitely capable of fast charging. However it is constantly dinging and connecting and disconnecting every other second if it's ever touched while in use. I have to sit my phone down still on a countertop or something and not hold it in my hand. If I'm trying to transfer a file I need to do that also and just touch the screen gently to not move it or it will completely disconnect and try and reconnect which would ruin any file transfers and progress and will mess up the charging as well. I feel like it's not plugging in deep enough into the phone like the original cable does.,3

I relaxed my muscles as the removal instructions told me when i tried standing up, but even though I could feel the rim it was like it kept slipping out of my reach every time I tried to grip it! This panicked me because I was in public and couldn't just lay on the stall floor to fish it out. Also, the cup seemed to disappear up there the first few days (my cervix height changed which is normal but made the whole removal time a pain).

The spout instead of a straw was also a major plus for easy cleaning. Unfortunately, this product had a nauseating odor when we got it. I ordered two and both had such a strong smell that it took countless washing, air drying and soaking in vinegar and soap for me to even consider putting a beverage in it. Several weeks later it finally seemed to dissipate and is now being used regularly without any problems. This little bottle would be absolutely perfect had it not been for the chemical odor.

Very disappointed and it fits loose on the back for a small shaper. I will keep it though for jogging in the summer when I want to have loose fitting shaper. I wish they made extra small size for someone like me. I've never been disappointed in slimming products except for this one. However, it is comfortable if you don't want anything that is tight and it is a nice thin material. It also gives me a little bit of breast lift. So I concluded that I will use adjustable material for my waist so that it will fit right. This shirt is not adjustable.",3
86040,"I’ve had this case for a couple months now. It fits perfectly and it looks great on my phone. I’ve dropped it a couple of times and it’s held pretty good. I did get a crack in my screen protector with my recent drop. One thing that bugs me is it says it’s scratch proof, but it’s not. After having it for a month or two I had scratches all over it. Now it’s all over. I bought it for the fact that it was scratch proof, so I was pretty upset to find out that the description was false.",3
96697,"I like the colors, the delivery was fast, they are a bit smaller but it was that some of my pattern isn't lined up correctly. I did put in for a return but I'm going to go ahead and keep both packages and support this company. Plus I work 2 jobs and just don't have time to send them back right now.",3
98998,I thought that this case would work with wireless charging but it does not. It's also fairly challenging to text and use the screen and fingerprint reader through. I don't want to use it as a full time case but for vacation in water it seems very useful.,3
107684,"I’m only giving it 3 stars because of the colors. They’re definitely not like in the picture. Also a lot of fuzz fell off of it when I put it on my bed, it got everywhere. It’s soft and lightweight but still disappointing.",3
91905,"This is really cute, but it's about half the size I was expecting (my fault, I didn't pay attention to the dimensions...I just went off the pictures). We still use it daily, just not for our intended purpose of storing blankets :)",3
80849,"Whoever designed this bottle has never used it. Can’t pour out without spilling, even when using a funneL unless you are directly pouring it into a tank. I mixed drops of this with gallon jugs which becomes a sloppy mess. Where’s the economy if you are spilling this stuff?",3

90596,"I wish the description had been more clear. These cannot go into any normal, candelabra-type fixture. They fit but then the ""pop"" and blow out the bulb. I thought it was a defect until I realized that these are meant for low-voltage fixtures. Instead, all of mine are trash now.",3

102082,"It's ok for patching a small spot & it sticks well, but it was thinner than the popcorn finish on my ceiling so I'm going with another option.",3
116103,Small and lid broke just after a few months of use. Liquid wont stay hot anymore because lid wont seal properly. It worked great before it broke.,3
101906,"I have a small collection of books related to using meditation to manage anxiety and disabling back pain. My therapist recommended this one, but I really liked my original book on using mindfulness to help control pain much better. Some psychology books drone on and on. This is one such book. The info is okay but the presentation is not very engaging.",3

91347,Too small my son just use it like for 2 week before left it!,3
95910,When it came only 3 of the 4 little dots were lit up so I thought whatever i'll just charge it. I left it on the charger over night and it never lit up so I'm not sure if it's broken or what but it's pretty disappointing. I'd return it but I really don't want to go through the hassle. EDIT**** I am adding a star based off of how good and responsive their Customer Service Team was. My charger ended up not working and they immediately emailed me and offered different solutions to see if my charger would work using various different methods. Ultimately none worked so they offered a replacement but I was actually leaving for vacation so they gave me a full refund. I was very impressed with the responsiveness of their CS team and trust me when I say if you have any problems with your product they will be quick and responsive and willing to get you a solution.,3
119830,The numbers were almost impossible to see. Had to use a magnifying glass,3
82652,This product is beautiful. Have had a wonderful time putting it together. The only upsetting part is that the letters/words are not legible. This was going to be a gift. Its going to take me a little longer to figure out how to adjust. Hopefully the makers can either enlarge the letters or find another way to add the verse so that it is not distorted.,3
110341,"Lots of things to like, but the mug didn't work for me because the handle slips too easily for my situation. Can't fault anything else.",3
103010,The hard plastic piece in at the foot needs to be moved lower or moved over so your foot doesn't hit . It's very annoying to hit in the night.,3
80113,"Not the best quality, but do the job, once you reinforce with nails and glue.",3
112859,The image above is not all what the shirt looked like but it was for a joke and it fit so all was good.,3
104917,"I had the same issue as another reviewer; they run easily. I like the open toe, which is the reason I purchased. They don't stay up that well as the nylon is not very elastic compared to other brands - more like what I imagine nylons were like years ago LOL. For petite women, the inseam is a little too long because the nylon is not elastic enough to hold them up. I need the open toe, so will keep wearing them until I find another brand.",3

93167,There is no way to get it out unless you take a knife and slide it under the edge. It needs a handle or something,3
