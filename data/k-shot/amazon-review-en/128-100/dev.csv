190574,This product was exactly what I was hoping for. I noted immediately that all of the strands worked since there were some reviewers that had problems. There is a teeny little piece of plastic that needs to be pulled out of the battery compartment before the strand would work. Some of these pieces of plastic had fallen quite far into the battery compartment which might have left some reviewers thinking it was out. I had no problems with my lights working and they were exactly what was advertised and exactly what I expected. I am using them for Halloween costumes but they are so pretty I may recycle them afterwards to put in a vase or something for a decoration!,5

The dimming switch is the best part- with just a touch of the finger you can either turn it off and on or make it brighter or dimmer. The wireless charger is also a great feature.

182494,"Did not love some lack of alignment for the 4 hard-drive screws so the SATA connector had to be re-seated, if you're installing this in a mini or macbook pay attention to this, because if the HD screws stick out you wont be able to place parts back. The instructions included do not advise to replace the two retention screws at rear SATA connector, however the holes are pre-driller. Otherwise I am thrilled with this product, will update if fails, but looks sturdy. Don't forget to unglue non-grounding stickers from old Superdrive and re-glue to this enclosure on a Macbook Pro.",5

I cannot have any light in the room when I'm trying to sleep, that really bothers me. I was worried as this did not sound like it had a complete ""off"" mode for the light, but I thought I'd try it. There are 4 brightness settings that can be adjusted by the big button the top at any time. I was very happy that the lowest setting is almost completely off. In the night, the lowest setting is almost not visible at all. Additional features I like are the USB ports, which are great for charging my phone.

I would highly recommend this alarm clock",5

1428,"I bought it, installed in, went on vacation and started using it when I came back. The suction mount is the worst I've seen in a dashcam or any product. It just doesn't stay put. I had to stick it twice a day for a week and every time it would fall with a thud, without any bumps and while it was parked at night. Second, the recording feature is all over the place. I liked their button settings which make sense. But after setting it up, the camera records randomly, says the disk is full (even if it's set on loop recording) and after formatting and changing card, still gives the error. The other day I found a bump on my car and when I checked the camera, NOTHING was recorded in the parking mode. So, I'm past the return window and should have tested it before going for a vacation. Seemed like a good product from the reviews. Maybe I got a bad unit. But in any case, check it if you buy it, but LOOK ELSEWHERE for a reliable unit.",1

Check before and after each use.,1
33675,"I bought this to try to balance one of my tires. When I got it I noticed that the unit was not balanced when I put it on a perfectly balanced floor. The bubble would always tilt to one side. I tired to use it and figured I might be able to compensate for that by shimming one side of the unit, but I could not get it to work properly. Part of the problem is that I noticed when you put the tire on there you have to tilt the unit a few times to ensure the weights you have placed on there are actually in the right position. A few tilts and spins would change the location of the bubble and with this unit not being calibrate properly that task was nearly impossible. I contacted the seller and after going back and forth for days, sending pictures, etc. and finally getting frustrated and telling them I will never deal with them again they finally refunded my money and told me to keep the unit. Fortunately the unit is made of aluminum so I can easily recycle, which is the only thing its good for.",1

Won’t purchase again.",1

32887,No problems with the product as it came as described however it appears El Garage is apparently code name for SAM'S CLUB!

1460,"The batch that I received was permanently affixed to the paper backing. When I tried to peel the stickers away nothing but paper came up behind them. Either way, these are probably not ideal to use on a wall. Based on what I saw I'm guessing that even if the stickers did peel off of their backing correctly that they would not be easy to remove from a wall even if you didn't leave them there for very long. I was especially disappointed because the label said this product was made in the U.S.A. - which I would like to support 100%. The alternative product that I ended up using (it is amazing) was made in England.",1

The case that holds the phone didn't come off from the whole wallet, so when answering a call, you have to put up the whole wallet to your ear. I literally put it on my phone to try it out and took it off and placed it in a drawer ever since. Waste of money.",2

First I noticed the metal plate for the magnetic holder did stay on right. The case is just to rough for it to stay stuck to. Second the part of the case where you plug the charger into broke right off. I'm not even sure how it happened, but it did. Maybe it was just a fluke. I don't know. All I know is I wasn't happy. Although it was just $39.99 it's still money I spent. They are supposed to be rugged. Oh, well. At least they will take it back and refund me the money. Not sure if they are refunding shipping. I forgot if I paid to get it sooner or not.",2

53541,"I got a pair of these boots from my son-in-law 8 years ago and loved them. I wore those boots out. After enjoying these boots soo much, I thought another pair were the logical choice. My initial thought when receiving the new pair was ""well...these LOOK similar to my old ones."" They felt a bit cheaper. Not as quality construction. Yet, they may be better, so I gave them a chance. I wear these boots 5 days a week as a security officer. Nothing overly strenuous, an inside job for the most part. After wearing the boots for a couple months, I noticed a crack starting on my left boot, in the crease where my toes bend back. I added boot polish, thinking maybe it was dried out or some issue was there. The crack has gotten worse and I am now seeing the same problem starting on the other boot. I dont know if this was a one off or a fluke, yet it changes my desire to buy 5.11 boots in the future.",2

I like her efforts to not make this a POV book; I really cannot stand POV books because you're just wasting your money on something you already have read. However, the storyline was kind of deja vu, pond intended. Like can we get a new antagonist? I feel this story could have been great but adding the same conflict from previous books of the series into the mix was a complete letdown. I am deeply disappointed. Honestly, I think the reviews on this book is based on her popularity and not this book.",2

71164,"Looked the look, and style. Liked the fact that it’s cool touch and quiet. However, if it’s only going to last four months this is not a good buy. So disappointed that it quit working already. We just bought this for my mother for Christmas and it’s the first of April 2018. Seriously, could have bought a cheep plastic one and it would’ve lasted longer...",2

66541,"Beautiful rug, just not sure why I received one that’s dirty? When it arrived it was not raining outside, yet the rug was damp and had a weird smell. I was putting the rug down and noticed a ton of dirt coming out of the rug onto the floor. There are also mud stains on the underneath of the rug.",2
63061,This product looked nothing like this. Much larger flags and really spaced out on the banner.,2
53980,Edges peeled up after couple days. Dropped phone once and it destroyed the protector around the camera hole.,2
58925,"I was expecting it to be made sturdier, but it is made with a soft material and does not really hold its form when inside my purse. The color is nice though with lots of pockets to put all the little items I carry in my bag. I just wish it was more structured so I dont have to constantly re-arrange my wallet, eyeglass case, and makeup bag every time i remove it from my bag.",2
66997,"These are nice, but the dangle doesn't need much to come off. Loose clothing is key.",2

62724,"First, mob was involved. So over them. There were errors. The characters were wishy washy (at least to me). Just over it.",2
77171,"Nothing wrong with the product. I ordered 2 of the same size, they sent 2 different sizes. I have no use for one, don't want to bother with a return. Disappointed since it was such a simple order!",2
63767,Was not happy with this product.,2
70289,"These are a tight fit for a 2X. Also, WHY print the label in black on a light colored shirt. It shows through the material. It's nice there isn't a tag but I would rather not see the printed label on the back of the shirt.",2
41321,Mine has a hole right in the middle of the sponge in two weeks although I handled it with great care.,2
53245,I’m 5’1 and 115lbs. Ordered a small and the shorts fit okay at best. They’re on the larger side in the waist for me but the length is alright. If you have longer legs I could see how they would be on the shorter side. I was sent the wrong color and there was no paper work or tags in order to return them to get the correct ones.,2

63022,I wish disnt buy it. Waste of money for the price,2
50962,Not impressed at all. Coffee smells & tastes burnt.,2
57744,"Okay, so these are super cute, though they don't fit right or stay in place. The material allows for it to slide backwards on your head and there is barely any give when trying to stretch it out. Cute if you're just lounging around, but wouldn't be a functional accessory when going out. Cute styles though!",2
43639,You will likely have damage to the finish.,2
71920,Cute jacket but at least 2-3 sizes smaller. I normally wear M (8-10) and had ordered a L based on reviews but it was still too small across the chest.,2

60833,It did not have a very strong vibration. was not able to please my girlfriend.,2
75899,I bought this and within a week I needed a jump start in my car. It completely fried out when the car was jumped. They sent me a second one and apparently if you try to change the name of the bluetooth connection(say to the name of your car) it will no longer be discoverable. Connectivity was often dicey as well. It would randomly drop or just fail to connect and the sound would often cut out even though the phone was less than 1 ft from the receiver.,2
75351,Slips off belt during normal activity. Will use for another purpose. NOT right for a Gun Belt Pack.,2

At first it wheeled like a dream. Being able to roll on all 4 or tilted on 2 wheels was really convenient. However, the 3rd time I used it the wheel broke off. I ended up having to carry it all around the airport. Really disappointed with the quality since I initially thought this was going to be a great purchase. The hard case seems like good quality and doesn't scratch or dent easily. But I wouldn't repurchase since it didn't last long.",2
63773,After checking it had the correct model number I found when it arrived in NZ it wouldn't work with my existing Davis Vantage Vue climate station. Turns out US models communicate on a different frequency from the rest of the world. An expensive mistake.,2

I got it on the 17th of July, and as of today, the 6th of August, it already has torn on the outside. I have never got it wet, I have never done anything other than keep it in my pocket, and it's already starting to fall apart. If it didn't have lots of pockets and the like inside to make it convenient for carrying all the stuff I need, I'd have given this a 1 star rating. But I have to give credit where it's due, if the material were more sturdy, this would be a great wallet. It's a little big, but all things considered not bad at all. I'm just worried by next month there won't be anything left of it.",2

137978,The hair is not human hair but it looks good for the price,4
124045,"Love the style, the fit is one of the most comfortable I've had in a long time although a couple pair do seem a little on the small side.",4
130047,Fine product and the fact that it comes individual packets is useful,4
157930,"These are really in a separate category when it comes to nutritional bars. Great quality, just wished they tasted better.",4
142227,"As many have noted, seems to be well made, and the actual product seems to perfectly match the pictures with the listing. Came with a tool to remove the old band, and new spring bars for the new one. Only gave four stars instead of five due to the initial stiffness. I actually opted to wear it with the band one notch tighter than needed for a couple of evenings, which seems to have broken it in. Now fits perfectly.",4
142429,Longer words would make it better. I get bored after 15 minutes as the same words pop up frequently.,4
159303,Great fit and perfect for work and after work events. True to size and color!,4
134515,With all the weight I've gained I'm always surprised when something is too large. I really dislike returning anything so I'll just wear it under my poncho. The fabric is exactly as I expected so not disappointed in anything but the fit.,4
121242,Just a touch wider than I had hoped. I am 5.5 and weigh about 140. The medium is a bit to wide at the bottom but a good longer length. It fits nice through the busy and shoulders.,4
134773,"Great swing very durable, wish the chains were longer and came with springs and a hanging kit as I know all of the material used to build this swing might have been about 40 bucks..",4

155093,The Montgomery series is my favorite Samantha chase series and this one did not disappoint. I also love a good second chance romance. I'd highly recommend this to everyone I know.,4
130687,Nice quality beads. Would have given 5 stars if clasps included had been a little better...nothing like making a nice necklace to have the clasp keep breaking making them unwearable.,4
142775,Good storage and pretty simple assembly. What I don’t like is the top just fits on with nothing to really secure it. I ordered another one that has a zipper top and much prefer that one.,4
155623,"The product works very well, I’m pleased. Small and compact easy to use. Only negative thing is the small print on the instructions.",4
142275,"I give it a 4 because of the sturdiness. The top is a little soft, so putting a drink on it and then another causes it to move and give. We will likely put a piece of glass on top so it doesn’t feel like your drink will fall over if someone picks up or sets down another one. Other than that, very attractive and looks nice with our Chair King set.",4
143058,"This works well, it is very easy to install. My main suggestion is don't loosen the screw too much when removing. The only things I would like is for it to swivel for uneven ground, and to be about 4 inches longer. Not big issues, but would be nice.",4
134209,"Great product, gives off lots of light we have two of these in our laundry room 11x14 ft and the light level is amazing",4
144069,"Overall, does a great job cooling a medium sized room.. It is however a little bit on the loud side, but not enough that it keeps you up at night.. It’s just white noise to me..",4
136262,Improves grip to 3 fingers instead of one!! But won't go in by back pocket.,4
138955,"Worth the money, but unfortunately most airlines rejects the purse height. Too high/tall to go on an airplane. If you're not using it to fly with your dog the bag is precious. My dog liked it. I recommend it still.",4
132671,Makes you think as to the evidence of ones faith and the necessity to be able to articulate the reason why you believe in Christ.,4
143768,Laura is the perfect heroine for my type of mystery - intelligent and realistic. She is independent and personable. The story kept my interest without the addition of a cop boyfriend or baked goods.,4

159146,Very compact and cheaper than other options. It works great!,4

155060,"The padded straps are very comfortable, but both they and the band were somewhat short. I'll probably need to go one size up.",4
143757,Really enjoyed this sexy read by a new to me author! I thought the plot was intriguing and the main characters were perfect for the story! Roman and Quinn had such an interesting dynamic and definitely held my interest! Looking forward to reading more from K. Sterling.,4
154248,Works as described. Just what I needed for my car but battery life is terrible. Does come with USB charger so I just leave it plugged in charging while I'm using it.,4
120045,Looks to be great fun.,4
142308,"This dress is classy! There's a reason it's an Amazon pick. It's a slightly stretchy material which is great. The sleeves were slightly loose as was the dress as a whole but it fits great! It hit me right below the knee. I am 5' 3"" and 175lbs if we're being completely honest. When I measured myself before ordering I measured 41"" bust 36"" wasit 45"" hips. I ordered a xxl. This is the dress I decided to keep out of three that I ordered. You could wear it to church as the v neck isn't too low very modest but it's great for a wedding it any dress occasion.",4
141837,Good product for the money.,4
129001,Great buy! The plastic is hard to take off. Kind of wish they used foam instead to protect it. I still have plastic on the bottom of it and it will not come off.,4
130772,"Everything in one place now - not carrying multiple units for different items. It is a bit heavy, but not anymore than the 3 things that it replaces.",4
130275,They are cute for work.,4
126914,"I know this seems counter-intuitive since this isn't an antiperspirant, but this natural deodorant has completely cleared up my hyperhidrosis. Perhaps I've been reacting poorly to the chemicals in the traditional deodorants I've been using? In any case, I really love the feel and smell of this product and I'm glad it's natural and isn't tested on animals. Plus, it doesn't mark up or stain my clothes! My only wish is that the sticks contained more product or lasted longer. All around, highly recommended.",4

121644,"I agree with many reviewers that this book is a recycled version of the first one. Plus, it's hard to explain time-travel to a 4-year-old. I much prefer the original story. However, my kids (ages 2 and 4) LOVE this book. They will pick it over the first one almost every time. They think the diapers and the ""tacos love dragons"" pages are hilarious. They also love the last page, although the pictures include multiple cultural references that they don't understand. So, who am I to question a book that my kids love so much?",4
131330,"Great oil. Just what I needed, although, the packaging left a lot to be desired. I had oil spillage everywhere when it was delivered. The company needs to wrap it better.",4
149798,"As expected. Not much protection with this minimal case. I would say it's not the best choice for a $950 phone. But if that's what you want, go for it. Fits well. Get what you pay for.",4
143498,Very soft and comfortable.,4
155140,Loving this..I might buy different colors,4
135435,I love all her books and try to read every one. They are always a great read.,4
150319,"I read reviews that I should size down and regret doing this. They fit, but just so-- I would have much more velcro to work with if I bought my true size. I didn't consider wearing my Apple Watch while working out and the velcro straps do effect this. The strap has pushed the button and turned off my watch mid-workout. VERY frustrating. I am working on a solution and trying to make it work!",4
122869,4 stars because it looks more like yellow than gold,4

149802,"It was a very fun and easy build, took about a half hour. I am 6'2 and I fit perfectly; the back and head support go a real long way. I have been able to stay comfortable for hours of gaming. Only draw back I have had is the arms are needing to be tightened constantly.",4
123185,Good quality for the price.,4
121459,"Instructions are very thorough, and it comes with 2 of everything needed (which is rare). Application was very easy and honestly one of the best feeling protectors I've ever used. Feels like I'm using the actual screen. Only issue is keeping dust from sticking to the adhesive side of the protector before you can get it applied. Hard as I tried (removed, cleaned and reapplied 3 times), I couldn't get a 100% dust free application. However, it is bubble free adhesion like the listing states.",4
120363,"When hitting the volume up/down button you can feel the give in the case and you can feel yourself hitting the buttons, but not on the power button. It feels hard and I can't tell if I am actually hitting the button or not. Case is really nice though. Very slick.",4
155208,"Looks good. Just not as durable as I thought. My brother seems to like it. Wasn't very expensive, so satisfied.",4
158159,"Not rigid like you’d expect, but thoroughly adequate . Fully loaded, it sags just barely.",4
133950,"I like this product and it holds a lite AR15 on the wall just fine, however my other gun seemed too heavy for the mount as it seemed to sag and droop a bit due to its heavy barrel. Also this is not designed to really work on a wall with lath and plaster or stucco!",4
141157,It was exactly as I expected it to be. It’s perfect for my kpop photocards.,4
159292,"I love this. But I can’t use it, and here are the reasons: PROS: -Color true to the picture. -Arrived on time with no scratches. -Closes perfectly (not loose like some flimsy stuff). CONS: -the bag part is veryyyy small and would only hold a phone . It should be called a belt with storage but definitely NOT a bag of any sort. So, I was going to wear this on my trip to the beach but it didn’t fit anything and I had to carry my big bag to be able to hold some cards.... I still loveit and wear it as a belt = )",4

147190,Great material and well made. Very comfortable,4
121101,"This is the third one I have purchased. It last about 2-3 years and gets a lot of use. It is the most comfortable float for sitting and floating around the pool with a drink. It will deteriorate faster if you leave it in the sun, we store under roof. Good quality. Not a kids toy as the mesh can be ripped, but this is mine and I take care of it.",4
152676,As others have said it is a little softer in the front but still has a little bit of shape. The quality other wise is pretty decent and the price was appropriate.,4

123402,Good size and nice color,4
146196,"I just want to say don’t buy this case if you’re not delicate with cases which is odd coming from a lifeproof review but hear me out, the water testing passed flawlessly, the sound was great, but whenever I called someone they said they could barely hear me even when I had the port open for chargeing port, that piece broke off within days as well. So overall I wouldn’t recommend buying this case if you treat your phone like a piece of wood in winter. I gave it 4 stars just because of everything else",4
156876,I believe this has greatly reduced my incidence of purple bruising. I select this brand for its being vegan and reasonably priced.,4

130007,"These are beautiful but two shelves were warped and it is highly recommended for the seller to provide two set of anchors for the bottom of the unit. Without additional hardware my items would be falling of unstable shelves. Not good as they come unless you have a handy person available to make that extra adjustment with extra hardware, disappointed, because they are so attractive. Need to be stable though!",4
148836,Batteries work. Comes in nice reusable packaging. Gave a 4 star as I haven't charged them yet. However they're currently in my son's high use toy and haven't needed charging yet.,4

139484,Great service and on time,4
156947,Great for normal sized footballs. Not great for Youth sports balls.,4
141652,Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Fits great and was delivered rather quickly.,4
152612,These are great for my journal. Some of them are too small to fit my smallest point pens. I will try felt tip. The case is a bonus! My children even use them to doodle.,4
151790,"Work uniform shirt is white, these are great to use to remove the coffee I spill on my shirt 5 times a day.",4
124789,Comfortable fit. They fit ok with over the ear hearing protection. The main drawback is the neck cord that comes off a little too easily. You really have to jam them on far.,4
155499,"I would love to give an actual review and will update if I ever receive the darn thing. UPDATE: I did finally receive this counter. It works as intended and allows me to keep better track of total fish caught, if getting one if those days. Much easier knowing how close to getting to that Crappie limit. Only 4 stars due to time to receive.",4
122582,"If you're not going to be using it every day, I definitely recommend this case. It's very nice looking and gets the job done. Because of the price, I would never expect it to hold up everyday wear and tear for longer than a couple months, but I'm happy with the purchase. Would buy again.",4
152632,"I bought the plant for the large leaf and used it as an accent piece in a bedroom. It comes in a rather small pot, so I placed it in an attractive taller planter, sat it on something to raise it up and covered the top of the pot with dry moss. That gave me the height I wanted. The leaves can be adjusted and the stems bend a bit. Good piece for the money.",4
148995,The clasps break too easy. The chew necklaces are awesome though!,4
152319,"Looks impressive on watch, changing its looks to a premium watch. Adhesion and durability will be proven with age.",4
141326,"Purchased this product after I read the reviews, still didn’t know what to expect but when I received the product and tried it for the first time I was very pleased. I had lost all sexual desire and it was like she woke up from a long sleep with tingling and sensation. My husband was so very pleased. This product does work very well!",4
141567,Used on a custom guitar case. The metal parts are a little lightweight.,4
149479,"Really strong for there size. I have other larger ones that are stronger and have an L hook that works better for hanging things from. If space is tight then these will work for light loads (small wire brush, manual etc etc) I don’t know if I would hang something that weights 10 lbs from them, feel 5 might be safer. They are better then what you can buy in most hardwares stores.",4
154441,Excellent fit and finish. Performs as expected. Would definitely recommend this product especially for the price.,4
129011,This helps keep my daughters hair frizz free. It does leave a bit of buildup if you use daily but a good clarifying shampoo once weekly tackles that problem. Smells ok,4

137346,Good deal for the money.,4
127365,"First time around I read the book, then I got the audible version read by Steve West. He's excellent and brings life to the wonderful story. I liked the writing very much - a bit otherworldly with plenty of adventure and mystery. Why not 5 stars? I use the same rating for all books, so I reserve 5 stars for true masterpieces. This is by no means a masterpiece but it brings a lot of reading enjoyment.",4
124223,"This was an exciting read. My only complaint was the reluctance to address race. I am still not sure if Peter is white or black. It took awhile to acknowledge the color of other characters.I just found that disconcerting. I mean the dog's appearance was loud and clear. I don't care but like to ""know"" the hero.",4
147609,"The sound quality is extremely good, although the BT connection is weak and with a small range. The band doesn't have the best of the grips either, making it slip to the sides very often.",4
156204,Love this sippy. No leaks and a simple design that is easy to clean. I like the bigger size. I don’t like that my kids can peek off the silicone parts.,4
132754,"I did a lot of research on this style. I wanted one that wasn't as bulky as mine, but still had plenty of room to carry enough for 2 kids plus my essentials. I love that it has an extra compartment in the front. Most that I looked at didn't have this. I also really like that you can access the inside from a zipper in the back and has the extra cell phone compartment. (I actually use it for my wallet.) I'm not super impressed with the insulated pockets, though. My kids' milk cups barely fit in them, and it's very hard to zip once they are. The insulation part has also come loose and slides down. Other than that, my only complaint is that I wish the inside liner was a darker color. I already have a stain from my sister's drink spilling into it which isn't a big deal, it would have just not been as noticeable if it wasn't so light. All in all, very pleased with my purchase especially for the price!",4
135230,"I love the full year row of calendars at the bottom, Since I use this calendar for work and often am working months ahead, this is great! I like the days past and to come feature, as that also helps with my job. I like the holidays and moon listings. Not a fan of the lack of white space. Last year's calendar had the month name inside the white space and that allowed me to write special reminders of upcoming events. This one doesn't have that small amount of white space so noting advance events is trickier. With that bar of white space, this would have been a 5 star review.",4
140947,These are a nice quality cotton pant. They run large and I do not know why they are so costly. You can buy shapewear for less. You can go down a size with no problem.,4
137980,"Brie captured the spirit of Captain Marvel better than I had expected. It is a good, fun movie, which happens to be a superhero movie with a female lead. OK? I liked the plot inversions from the source material--some purists didn't or thought there were ill-timed jokes. I'm definitely going to check out her other movies.",4
155003,I like that you are able to stand the tablet up! Not sure it would give a good amount of protection if tablet was dropped!,4
149441,"Nice eyeliner,glad I tried it!",4
128454,"Challenging, makes me frustrated but I keep coming back to play.",4
152247,"Strong scent, takes some getting used to. Lathers well.",4
142044,Dress cool and comfortable but wasn’t a good fit.,4
128206,"If you are interested in 30 Day Paleo Challenge, then this book is for you. From this book I learned how to start my Paleo Diet Plan. This cookbook includes the Paleo Bed and breakfast recipes, Midday Paleo meals, suppers from the Stone Age, soups, salads, and a few leftovers from the Paleolithic Era, a few good Paleo Desserts and Beverages. All recipes are saved with simple ingredients and easy cooking directions. I found this book very informative and useful. It is well written and good organized. I really got much new and important information on all my questions on this topic. I liked this guide and would recommend it for those who want to lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle.",4
149601,Really nice product. Keeps the stove looking neat and clean. I do wish the actual stove pieces were silicon and more resilient but so far it's been a few weeks and these are holding up fine. I love the side panels for the countertops!!,4
158498,"I really like this space saving toaster/toaster oven. Would like if the unit was an inch higher ... very low space when using the oven part. Would also like a timer for the oven. Finally figured out the ""pop up"" for the toaster ... tried the old fashioned way ... simply pushing up on the toaster lever... well that didn't work. Then I found the cancel button and that's actually pretty nice. On the whole, I love it.",4
153682,"Want to look like a fluffy cloud and get clean? This product is for you! A tip I would give is, use as directed. I left this on a little longer than directed because, well I was enjoying being a cloud and I liked the tingling, but my face was kinda itchy and red after I washed it off. The next time I used it, I kept it on for the directed time and I had no issues.",4
133521,Nice table runner! Well made and great addition to our decor!,4
80504,They fall off my sons face,3
110083,For non stick this is the most impossible item to clean. Thumbs down. But it sure is cute.,3
82006,After purchasing this we realized our dog prefers beds with a vertical edge surrounding the center cushion.,3
101427,"Third humidifier I purchased for apartment this year. This one feels exceptionally cheap, difficult and messy to take tank off, open, fill and re-assemble.",3
115075,Hard to spray into the toilet without it leaking all over my hand. Would not buy it again.,3
112391,"It's a nice band however the description says it expands to 9 inches, the reason for buying this one. I was disappointed that it was only 8 inches and is difficult to go on over my husband's hand.",3
103683,"This was great, until it started leaking after only 5 months..",3
112109,Don't like how cheap it looks. I know its rubber but I can't stand the squeaking sound it makes on waxed floors. Also dislike the apparent seam down the middle of the shoe.,3
116848,Worked great for a couple of weeks. No longer runs. Disappointed. Cause it worked really good for awhile.,3
96774,"not exactly what I was expecting, it almost seems like you get a random selection of earrings based on a color and category (large and bulky, or small and dainty). I was hoping for something specific within the picture and I did not receive that.",3
106489,"It takes forever to heat. I suggest filling it with distilled water, plug it in and the go gather your items. With that being said, once it gets going I was able to steam 3 items before it needed refilling (1 denim shirt to freshen, 1 sweater that was wrinkled and a cotton shirt that was folded) Works well. I ended up returning the steamer. It was really not that powerful and it took forever to heat/steam. The company does offer great communication.",3
98799,Cute boot but really meant for someone with big calves. Leather creases very easily.,3
99486,"I’ve bought 2. The first one had agood life and I replaced it due to cover wear. It was still doing it’s job, just looking ratty. The 2nd one started to break within a week. At this point so much has broken off the edges I need to replace it already...after weeks now, not years. I’ll be replacing this with a different brand. Leaving 3 stars because the first case was pretty good, and perhaps I just got a lemon. For the current experience I’d stretch to give it 2.",3
104506,These pacifiers are VERY large and my breastfed baby wouldn’t take them. I was happy with that since they were so large and just looked odd when she was trying to use it,3
110465,"Maybe it's just the one I received but if I squeeze then release the handle normally it doesn't take a full bite the next time and I don't get a full pull on the next squeeze. I have to release quickly so the handle snaps forward. Once I figured out the trick it works fine but it's irritating. I use this a lot, a number of times a week. Everything else about it is great.",3
91977,Arrived with spots on the cover.,3
93099,"Received Feb 2018 - Excellent bag, very sturdy however, the description states 3 insulated compartments inside.... none of the compartments are insulated. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this bag. Very disappointed! Update May 2018.... approximately one month after purchasing this bag one of the clasps that attach it to a stroller broke. Instead of just returning it I contacted the seller to ask how to replace it since I really do love it. However, they never responded to my emails. I am more than disappointed!! This bag states “Lifetime guarantee”!!!! It’s a shame that such a good product has to get an awful review due to bad customer support.",3
94344,Mirror has distorted reflection because it bends easily. A bit flimsy. But my granddaughter likes it.,3
91052,"Product was top quality, but I wasn't in love with this flavor.",3
107982,"Cute & fun to wear, but size was way larger than expected.",3
113677,Cheap option for a fun and funny outfit. Size is off and fabric is not pajama qualify.,3
98280,"Mine worked fine for about two weeks. I opened it to check batteries and had to dodge wasps upset that I was invading their new home. They had entered through bottom drain holes or side vents. There may be other solutions, but I taped over the openings and drilled new, smaller, drains. Easy to do but should not be necessary. The gadget works fine. Very happy, but design invites bug problems.",3
102753,These are very thick and make shoes tight if not use to this thickness. But super soft and comfy otherwise.,3
101061,Problems with the part in front.,3
92709,"The Grunt tee’s are very nice, they fit really well and they look live foo...this one with the red white and blue eagle is my least favorite.. I really like the plain white 👍 I probably have at least 10 Grunt tee’s.",3
85037,"Cute imitation, but I don’t think it will last long. A bit bulky too.",3
92404,The product is vey basic. Doesn't include screen protector and case. This can generate additional costs It is not updated with the latest operating system or security patch level. The product presents an issue with Hotspot WIFI and Windows 10. Hardware a some poor.,3
115630,Smaller than expected,3
100623,"They seem ok. Very light, chopsticks look like picture but packaging/label was completely different. Even a different companys name on them.",3
107061,They had 2 scratches in the outside. I returned them,3
104903,Produces lots of fun but a lot smaller than I expected for the price.,3
88169,Ordered once and returned due to it being broken. Ordered a second time and it was broken again but not as badly so we kept it.,3
85367,No instructions were included in the box so when it came to filling the water gun with water it was confusing where to pull up the cover or unscrew it. You need to unscrew it. Once that was taken care of they were fine for the first day. On the second use one doesn’t hold pressure and one does.,3
114555,Paint was just okay. They could make a better product to do touch ups with for people who are serious about doing it the right way. Paint dries to quickly.,3
115627,"It was great starting out, but after the one yr mark it went from cutting hair to pulling.",3
116672,"I really liked the look and feel of this shirt and actually purchased two shirts (greg and blue). Unfortunately I had to return the second one because I noticed that both would retain (and even magnify) my B.O. This is troubling for me personally because I don't sweat much and my normal workout cotton tshirts never smelled like these. Now I know why some other fitness shirts cost more and it's because they are odorless. I don't normally write reviews but was compelled only because I want other Amazon buyers to know. Like I said, the shirt looks nice, fits well and does keep me cool and dry, but the smell is going to drive me to buy other brands.",3
107451,"The looped fabric ring to hold the weight of the strap does not work efficiently, and will tear when holding excess weight. I would advise another bag.",3
115249,"It’s an ok textbook. A whole lot of poorly worded problems and unexplained solutions that don’t follow the format of the examples. The textbook does provide detailed calculator instructions, and it’s much more convenient to flip through a book than scrolling endlessly through a digital copy. I had both a (maybe bootleg) pdf and the rented hardbound text, and I found myself using the hardbound textbook most of the time. This textbook is definitely worth no more than the rental price. Let’s be honest, though, you will be learning most of the material from your professor and Khan Academy. Like Mr. T said, I pity the fool that has to teach himself statistics with a textbook. Or something like that.",3
103972,"Great fit, however gap between the buttons are spaced to far apart. You will need to wear tank to hide bare skin.",3
116504,"This pillow was reasonably comfortable, if not somewhat noisy. My biggest gripe is it has started leaking air after 4 overnight trips. Perhaps this is a problem for all inflatable pillows but I think I will go for a compressible pillow next.",3
80888,Already chipped only had it for 2 months but for the price it’s decent.,3
90545,"Seems like a decent screen protector and really easy to install, but the case pops it up. It won't stay down all the way.",3
118081,This worked well. It isn't that loud and it doesn't t play blue ray DVDs. For both of those reasons I would not purchase again.,3
100568,"Product did not work as expected. Lots of leakage. Coffee very weak, even with following the instructions explicitly.",3
114818,I like the bed but I did not recieved the correct hardware to assemble the bed. I've try to contact them but have not gotten a response about getting the right parts.,3
87885,Bought this for use in a big rig. The stabilizer cup is a great idea but doesnt really hold onto the arm tightly enough.,3
107212,It was just ok for me. I'll try again. Let's see what else kate canterbary has to offer. Can't wait.,3
97216,"The only change I would make, is the lid and silicone form should be threaded. Water gets under the clear inner bucket, which bulges the bucket. Just a thought.",3
116266,"The color was lighter than anticipated. It's very thick but still doesn't hide blemishes as well as i would have thought. Definitely waterproof and does last a long time. this tube would probably last forever as it only takes a very small amount. The biggest problems I have are tat if your skin is even remotely dry, it will cause your face to look even more so and flaky. I think it is also causing my face to break out.",3
97803,Works well with my low/ akward shower head. My only complaint (pretty big deal though actually) is that the suction cups that hold it in place are almost flat. So they don’t work very well. Otherwise the design is good.,3
89131,It could be better. I ordered 10 rolls as described on Amazon but I got 9 rolls instead.,3
80305,I have pain in my feet at the end of the day .Pain flows up my leg.,3
90911,It was pretty but very flimsy.,3
90278,"These are nice patches, but they do not iron-on. After one wash everything fell off, so if you buy, expect to sew on.",3
86196,"Well, this holder will not take a iPhone 10 with a case, and will not take a galaxy 5s with case.",3
101089,"Well It was not what I expected. It is as described and works, but it is very thin. I will have to just go out and buy another one. I would say this is more for a cheap landlord trying to get a small apartment ready for someone. Im worried the kids will pull on it too hard and it will tear off the hooks. That is how thin it is.",3
104422,"With about 4"" of litter in the box, I grabbed the handle to move the box a few feet and the locking clips broke. This box is not a good value for the money. Spend a few more bucks and get a unit constructed of thicker material",3
104782,It was ok. Some of the info seemed a little stale ut the rest of it was a fun read.,3
93508,"when your baby uses, you should be careful because they can squeeze their fingers all the time! on those age, they want to open it themselves.",3
80885,"When I pull the yarn through, it gets stuck on the light. The light should be moved back on the hook about a half inch. Nice concept; just didn't work for me.",3
117572,"I usually wear 7 in shoes with a heel and 7.5 in athletic shoes, but I definitely should have ordered a 7.5, maybe even 8. The heel was taller than I expected, but that's my fault for not knowing the height of a heel a wanted.",3
107947,"Very much like the one I had as a child. It has more plastic then the earlier version, but its still durable.",3
87571,I received email with manual attached Response was quick.,3
83123,Too slippery; just a little bit of sweat made this thing impossible to hold positions.,3
109072,I have been wanting to try a weighted blanket for my insomnia. I loved the weight of it and I was able to go asleep pretty easily with this one but I would wake up in the morning so hot! I even started sleeping with the fan on because i was falling asleep so easily but I had to return it because it's just not working to keep me asleep.,3
85547,Still taking initial box. Will report back later,3
84766,has trouble charging and now won't turn on at all.,3
91928,Loved it; I could not put it down. Stayed up way too late to finish it. You will not regret this purchase,3
88433,"Use in the shower! The water SHOOTS out and could fly across the room quite easily. Even if you keep your mouth shut while using, it will shoot, spill, or fall our of your mouth. Not trying to drink my dirty, gum water haha",3
87739,Item arrived bent. The package was in perfect condition so I can onl assume that it it damaged at the warehouse before packaging or while being packaged.,3
116133,A little large for ear,3
83441,Purchased this unit in July 2017. Discovered that it died in October 2018. Don't know how long before that it quit. The fan stopped working so no air was being circulated.,3
111340,Very disappointed because my light does not work on my glasses,3
89827,Some of these smell good and others smell kind of 'ok'. They cause a strong allergy response and causes my nose to burn and other times cause a headache. I stopped using them.,3
109897,I was really hoping this dog bed would last longer but I'm afraid to say it lasted 7 months. It's really starting to fall apart and it wasn't cheap,3
95096,Works good but prefer my silicone bowl based on more kernels pop. The popcorn bottle necks in this one and starts to burn. Portion size is smaller too.,3
87979,These are definitely not for high impact. MY breasts feel like that move around like crazy in them. I also dislike how the pad is removable and the way it is makes your breasts look awkward and very pointy.,3
104581,My hamster gave up trying to get the treat out. It was also hard to get them out when I tried to put in fresh treats. If using smaller treats it should be easy but you want it to be a challenge to stimulate the hamster to enjoy working for the treat.,3
94892,Gave away...wanted a month organizer,3
117393,My box is constantly dropping my WiFi connection and my router is 5 feet away,3
100866,"I wish the cream portion and the liquid portion mixed together better. I bought this for two reasons: My eyelashes and my dad's eyebrows. His eyebrows are salt and pepper at this point and we'd like them darker. My hair/eyelashes are brunette but the ends of my lashes are blonde. I tried this on myself first three times. Although it seemed to dye my lashes a little bit, I couldn't see a significant difference. The texture of the product is odd; the mixture doesn't actually mix well together which may cause problems. I tried it on my father. It's not as good as using regular hair dye on his brows but the fact that we can use this multiple times makes this more economical. We leave it on him for 15-20 minutes and I really have to COAT it on his brows. Once we wash it off, they are darker but not as dark as with hair dye. Using regular hair dye was much easier to do on his eyebrows but paying for an entire box just for brows wasn't worth it. I'm going to use the rest of this product but I doubt I'll buy it again.",3
97065,"This television series is not strong on story and character development, but a lot of good little skits inserted in each episode, here and there.",3
111702,Good protection for the device. It gets scratched easly,3
114734,"I like this case, but it's somewhat difficult to get the plastic bumper part on and off. And once I finally got it on, it cracked after a few weeks, after very gentle use and no drops. I still have the rubber part of the case, which is fine and offers good protection on its own, but it looks and feels weird without the bumper.",3
119842,"unfortunately, it was sitting on a table on my covered deck and the wind caught just the charging top only and blew it off. It was very lightweight but the charging lid broke on the landing on the ground.",3
100239,I could not get the motor to work for rotation. It doesn't do anything other than local stations (within 20 miles). It's advisable to take any figures of distance with a grain of salt. Cut that figure in half and remember; no antenna can get past 70 miles unless you're on a mountain. You may get close to 70 miles with a big antenna.,3
82939,"After only eating one of these, my tongue was raw. I am not sure what the issue is, but this happened to me and my daughter, my sons were fine. I've had these before, so I am not sure what happened.",3
84569,Their ok. I didn’t like the sound quality it was kinda low. Gave them to my wife she likes them though.,3
119708,Not happy with these. The do not give me the light I really needed for my back yard area.,3
81249,Wasn't satisfied at all.,3
97227,"It made my camera work, but the materials are inferior to the original.",3
104396,Cute but the bedding STINKS! Really really strong odor.,3
97418,Good but WAY over priced. I will not likely purchase again,3
88842,I tried a lot of Vit. C serum. This one is okay. I love the scent. It's not that thick compared to others and it's just gentle to the skin.,3
85803,I do love it but it could have been just a little bigger around. I’m a small woman so it wasn’t too bad but the bottom of my jacket does get wet and if the wind blows only the part under the dome stays dry. But I love that it goes over my face I just wish it was a little bigger around.,3
110552,"These are really nice, very well made, and far prettier, but I found that a pair of small channellocks works better.",3
84584,Took 3 days to charge my 12v marine battery for my camper,3
115409,Fall apart pretty fast and are as my daughter explained very itchy bras.,3
119654,I am rating this 3 stars because i had ordered a large as it said it would fit a lab but instead i got something that is much smaller. luckily i got this for my rabbit and not my dog as she is medium sized and it does not fit here. i would say it is a decent product as it is sturdy but the size was small. the nice thing is my bunny does like it a lot,3
88630,I like it overall but sometimes it gets so staticy,3
95393,Ok I quess. Didnt see any results though,3
105638,they are very thin material wise. dont know how long they will last,3
118111,Following women going through problems and how they come together to support each other.,3
108589,"I would love to review these, but have not had a chance to use any yet.",3
86492,It worked very well for one of my dogs and sometimes for my other in training. Major problem with durability. Hasnt't even been two months and the button caved in and it's no longer operable,3
119382,Not making vain go away and it said on the inter net,3
85196,Very plastic looking at close up,3
106088,"First off, it reads dead on. It’s easy to use...but it’s a bit flimsy. I used it twice, took it back in the house and noticed the metal probe was no bent in the plastic housing off to one side. How the heck does that happen? It still works though and it was cheap.",3
92546,"I love Arnold and his story to be very uplifting. I enjoy the insights he provides. However, many of the chapters could have been condensed into one chapter. There were so many details provided that I found to be tedious.",3
108762,"I had really high hopes for this duvet cover as so many people praised it. I just washed it today and dried it on the delicate setting and it came out incredibly wrinkled. Since it is cotton I did not want to dry it on the normal setting. Should I have done so instead? The pillow cases were so wrinkled I had to iron it. Someone had mentioned that when they took it out of the dryer it was nice and straight. Also, as I was putting my pillow in, some of the stitches went loose. For the price, I was definitely expecting something better.",3
101522,The holder arms are too short that makes the strut get in the way of other spring components. Have to use wrenches to twist rather than impacts.,3
87073,"My old console tray had a small main area which held my old Galaxy phone just fine, but not my Galaxy S10 :-( So I got this because of its larger main area. But it really does seem backwards. there is not much of a lip at all on the back. The front 1"" wide front section has almost no lip towards the front, so I can't think of anything that you could actually use it for. The two side areas, while also not having any lip to constrain items to the rear, can at least hold a chapstick without it falling out for almost a complete jeep trail. (This is for a Jeep, right? don't you think items might be subject to some small bumps in it's normal usage? ) But it does hold my phone flat, so I don't have to dig in my pocket for it.",3
102033,Very comfortable. Too bad they fall apart so quickly. Uppers cracked and peeled even when polished and conditioned. Lasted maybe 4 months. Soles were still perfectly fine.,3
82518,It is very hard. Can't really be used for dodge ball. Works well as a basketball though.,3
108533,"Arrived and it was sooooo long. I figured it would shrink in the wash but it shrunk by over a foot! I am now wearing as capris. Still comfortable but I ordered them for the winter, not summer months.",3
98823,Love these bags but they didn’t come with any twist ties or any other way to close them. I don’t think I’ve ever bought treat bags that didn’t come with at least a basic twist tie. I ended up having to buy additional items to seal the bags. FYI it’s very hard to find twist ties alone to purchase in stores!,3
83197,"It's not as textured as I expected, it's also lighter than I expected (expresso brown). It also feels flimsy and is pretty small.",3

96122,It's came in good condition the Box was packaged Vine it just took several days to charge it and have to reset it several times for it to connect to my app,3
106315,Nicely made but a bit too small.,3
102443,"The top was guaranteed to not roll down, but this rolls down on me.",3
87178,it tastes very good. but it's too similar to frosting and not very slippery.,3
98646,It didn't hold onto the plug so I had to use a magnet and it wasn't long enough to reach a couple of the plugs that were deep in the heads but works well just takes some rigging,3
82561,"These are too small. I wanted somewhat tight for assurances, but these were just too small. I even sized up - I wear a 16 on bottom but ordered xxl. The leg holes are too tight. Overnight MIGHT be okay but I cant walk in them. Disappointed.",3
84880,"I could shove in 8 passports, but I couldn't comfortably close the wallet with so much bulk inside. If you don't actually need to keep 8 passports regularly, this could be useful. I returned mine since I need to carry 7 passports while travelling, and this isn't cutting it.",3
107676,"It works, but dries very slowly. Also, it’s got a strong odor. I use this for fine detail gluing, so I’m right on top of it. I then saw the warning on the tube that it can be cancer-causing. Great. Probably won’t use this anymore for up close projects. Was just getting tacky after sitting for about 10 minutes, so not ideal for quick hard gluing.",3
119216,These are not compression but they are a decent top. They are not long and sit just on hips.,3
