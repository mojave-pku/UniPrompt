The silicone unfortunately ripped and got stuck to the glass on the bottom the first time I tried to use it so the seal is no longer functional, but Amazon provided a full refund and I didn't even need to return it so great customer service and it didn't inconvenience me. If that didn't happen to the pan, it would have worked perfectly.",3

83406,I ordered the wrong phone size. Not the company's fault. I looked at the return policy and I only get two bucks back if I tried to return it. It looks like it's a nice quality just bummed about the return policy. Ordered the correct size from a different company with a better return policy.,3

83834,I was disappointed in this book. It is obviously self published. There are a lot of errors in the recipes as well as the information.

The speaker is not too loud and it doesn't provides that Home Cinema Theater experience I was expecting. If everything around is quite, I can have a decent sound. Third, the battery life is good enough. Fourth and last, the Price is too high considering what I mentioned before. For this price I would be expecting a decent, strong BT Connection and a louder volume sound. Bottom line, it would be a good shopping if the price gets cheaper.",3

The reason I'm holding back from 5 stars is that the neck cord does get a little bit awkward at times, but more importantly the bluetooth range is really problematic. I've been using the headphones for about 4 days now, and half the time when I slip my phone into my front jeans pocket (a totally normal place for the phone to go), the audio on the Porta Pros starts stuttering. Take the phone back out, audio clears up immediately. I don't have this problem with multiple pairs of Bose bluetooth headphones, nor with Apple AirPods - each of these maintain an unbroken audio connection even when my phone is clear across the room.

90676,"We do not have a specific complaint about this product. There is no indication that it is anything other than what it claims to be. After replacing the screen, the iPhone 6 Plus became nonfunctional but that is NOT the fault of the product in any way. Everything an experienced expert needs is provided. Instructions are a bit unclear due to translation challenges, we believe. We resorted to a recommended video to augment the printed instructions. Even though we followed instruction carefully step by step, and were successful in replacing the screen, some step was not done correctly. OUR EARNEST advice is this, The operation of replacing the screen is not a DIY project. It takes experience to overcome those steps that do not go as smoothly or easily as the instructions say or as multitude of video seem to demonstrate. There will be something that is not exactly the way it is presented and there will be some connection that will not be able to be removed and replaced as easily as one is led to believe. Again, there is nothing wrong with this product. There are a couple of things better than any video showed but the overall procedure requires some expertise we did not have - obviously, since we now have an iPhone 8 Plus and the 6 Plus is simply a repository of data for us to collect through a WiFi connection if necessary.",3

184267,"I have a Sprinter RV. We are going to tow my Prius up to Minnesota from our Florida home. That way we'll have local transportation while visiting this summer. So, I installed a rear view camera with a 7"" monitor on my drivers console. Unfortunately, with the large windows in the front, there is an abundance of sunlight coming in and made the monitor difficult to see. So this deep sun shield is perfect for that problem to be solved. If you need to shade your viewer, this is how you can do it. Always a clear and sharp picture.",5

170887,"This little compressor really has power. I was looking for something to keep in the trunk that ensures you can always pump up a car tire. This thing is pretty small for what it can do. It is easy to operate and if you know the tire pressure you need, you set it and turn it on and it shuts off when that psi is reached. The cords are long enough and the case it comes in was an added bonus that I wasn't expecting (I may have missed that in the description). We plan to use it to blow up pool floats as well since it has the little attachments for those or for balls. Very happy with this purchase for a great price.",5

9669,Purchases to try to help my cat. 16 years old with a heart and kidney problem and walking a tight rope right now. She would not eat it and I did not even realize that it was supposed to be refrigerated after you open that. Or a girl that she would not eat it. I contacted the seller asking if I could return the unopened tub since I got two tubs and I believe they made a fair offer to return the money for one tub and help me just throw out the rest of it. So I supposed to get half of the purchase price back. Figured that was fair enough. Problem is when they refunded money they only refunded a quarter of the purchase price instead of half. Not sure if this was a miscommunication. So I am still trying to work on it.,1

If you are listening to music, this works well. It has extended base that will give music some additional punch. Unfortunately, my requirements is geared for communications rather music. When I first installed this, it took a while for the BT to connect but once it did it was faster the next time. If I listened to music and had a call come in, the BT dropped off, sometimes it would drop off and then picked back up several times before it stayed on. I would have to say ""hello"" 3 to 4 times before the person on the other end could hear me. One of my trucks is a diesel, the noise canceling was NOT up to par, others couldn't hear me over the engine. I would pull over and shut the engine down to continue the conversation which negates the reason I bought this device. I would then hear the person on the other end but they would fade in and out.

60656,"I want to give this a 5 star review but simply can't because it's HUGELY flawed. The big flaw here is how your GoPro (etc) mounts. It mounts just fine but you can't properly fit the thumb screw in place. The more you tighten it, the hard it is to tighten because it hits the frame of the light. I can't believe they were able to even sell this the way it is, it's that bad. That said, without enough work (and a screw driver) you can tighten it down but make sure the housing for your GoPro will stay with this light permanently because having to unscrew and re-screw it would be a huge pain. Dedicate a GoPro case/holder/frame/housing (whatever it's called) just to this and it becomes better. The other issue is that the battery doesn't last long. A few hours probably but that's not long. The charger blinks orange and green while charging so you'd think it would turn green when done, right? Nope, blinks orange and green forever regardless. So you just have to charge it for hours or overnight and assume it's fully charged, and hope it is. The light itself is amazing. If they'd fix these MAJOR flaws this is easily a 4 star light and works greast with my GoPro Hero 7 Black.",2

I contacted BLU about this and tried of few of their steps to solve the issue and eventually had to send out the phone. After 5 weeks I got my phone back and tested it, again I was not able to receive calls. I should mentions that I tested the sim card on my LG and everything worked fine. so I contacted BLU again and told them I was still having issues, after jumping through the same hoops with hard reset etc. they finally agreed that my phone might be faulty. I received a new phone after 5 weeks and everything seemed to be working correctly, now I'm starting to get the same complaints from friends and family that they can't call me.

The first replacement filter lasted 9 days, and clogged on the 7th day. Same for the second. The third filter has been in used for 23 hours and the meter already indicates 1. This is after only one fill up of the 30 cup container. Zero water support did not want me talking to their quality control or development sections. They also said when the filter clogs you remove it beat rapidly on it, then reinstall at which point you will see bubbles from the trapped air being released. Again this was not so. I never saw any bubbles and the filters failed within 24 hours of preforming this procedure. They also said no difference between filter provided with the product and replacements, yet the results demonstrate there is a big difference in quality. When you call customer service the canned announcement states if you do not want to wait press #1 leave your name, contact information and a Customer Rep will call you back. I used this option twice and I never did receive a callback. The majority of customer reps I spoke with, including their supervisor who was exceptionally rude and condescending. Added info: The fourth filter clogged almost immediately. Only one 10 glass of water ran through and it clogged.

That to me just screams yuck, and I thought it was incredibly disrespectful. Beyond that the entire story kind of leads up to her finally finding out hes a male escort and it was not even an exciting climax. She gets told and is like ""oh I feel so stupid, I should have known."" Should have known? Who in their right mind would ever expect that? And then all he does is apologize and says he loves her after literally 4 dates of straight lying to her and shes like ""oh he loves me? Hes so sexy I cant resist!"" Like really? Have some self respect! Then shes more appalled that hes never done oral with a client then anything else. This book fell completely flat, honestly wish I could get my money back.

70669,This was a Barely Serious Book Club selection. I would not otherwise choose science fiction published in 1969. A challenging read. No one at dinner had completed reading the book except the member who chose the book. She explained its significance in the evolution of sci-fi and some of the plot so I picked it back up. The incredible journey of the two main characters across the ice that also leads them to understand each other is truly epic. I read for pleasure and escape. This book while worthwhile required a lot of effort.,2

I've had other cheaper desk bikes that i was able to tune to a lot more resistance that gave me a much better work out, and at home I have a much better desk bike that uses magnetic resistance and works very well.

139231,"Excellent product for the price. I wish I had a good work bench to mount this to because I did sets of sights holding it in my hands; yes it can be done! I gave this four out of five stars only because of two things. 1. Does the handle bar slide left and right, because it didn’t for me (maybe I should have tried harder). This exacerbated the issue of me needing the pusher to be further in to rotate the handle. 2. Needing a bit more height on the rear sight mover and possibly a deeper mover. To explain, I was mounting rear sights onto a red dot plate , this was only slightly problematic. Once I had those mounted I needed to mount the plate to the pistol. First, I needed to have the pusher only engage the plate, not the sights which are suppressor height (needing more depth or height in the pusher). The height of the pusher negated me mounting the plate properly and I had to remove the slide and manually mount. Perhaps mounting the plate first would have been more workable but I was using the already mounted sights as a point of reference. One other thing to add, perhaps tick marks on the pusher instead of just on the frame (they are small and harder for me to reference than if they were on both to help with centering). All and all, this is a good quality tool for at home or even shop use, time will tell as I use it more.",4

132174,"4 stars... and i'll tell you why. Negative: The bar was not fully coated with the black rust resistant spray, there were small parts at the knurling that had silver/iron streaks where it was not fully coated. Positive: Structurally solid!! Comes oil sprayed for rust prevention, knurling on this bar is superb! Grips better than any curl bar i've ever used. Feels heavier than most curl bars i've lifted at the gym, which I like! I really dig the fist decal, doesn't seem cheap. As I'm writing this review I see that the GOPLUS black coated curl bar is out of stock and its only showing the chrome one. OVERALL: Worth buying! Just not having the knurling fully coated in black was a tad disappointing, but I know this bar will last years to come!",4

Thr first thing that I like about these earphones is that it doesn't come off as easily when I am sweating or even just running. The previous ones I had these hardships and thankfully, these fix those problems. Another thing that I like about these earphones is the Bluetooth range is actually stronger than the ones I had before and even when I cover my hand on the side that has the Bluetooth receiver, it doesn't cut off the sound. Also, there is a case and my previous headphones didn't have a case. In that case (no pun intended), my previous headphones didn't have protection and they will break easily. But there is one gripe I have, which I mentioned before, which is not having a functional Play/Pause button. Whenever I press the button on the side of the earphones, it won't pause or play music. But, when I hold it to get my voice assistant and then press it once, it works. So, I hope this issue get solved once there's another version of these.
