87578,"You get what you pay for I guess. It was quite large. I measured my son and ordered a size smaller than what he would usually wear, the jacket was so big around the waste and the material was not very nice. I did return it and ordered a different one.",3
112066,I don't care for the dropper. I bought this for my car to keep mice away hard to get in tight places,3
96394,"Bought for my husband, he's a size large. Unfortunately, the fit around the arm is pretty tight. The rest fits true to size. He still wears it hoping it will stretch. Its a nice shirt, feels soft, I'd recommend buying a size up just in case.",3
93624,I absolutely love this high chair. The print is adorable and it is so lightweight it's perfect for a small house. My only complaint was the cover was not removable so when my son's diaper leaked on the non wipeable part of the fabric I had to cut and sew the cover to ensure that it was removable. Safety belts still come through and my son is still secure and I don't have to worry about gross stains where he eats. I'm not sure who thought non removable was a good idea for a high chair.,3

104626,"I bought this for my mom who had vision problems. I thought this would be the same as the 4 compartment one. This one has a lip separator for each pill box which is a lot more difficult for my mom. The other box allowed you to slide the pill box in place. It is okay for the normal person, but not if vision impaired. Also the lid doesn't close down flat unless you click it closed.",3
102434,"It's exactly what I excepted it to be. However, I just want to state a suggestion/improvement to the product. It would be nice if you have a quantity of 4 sets of legs. That way you could use an extra set to raise your stand a little higher. So I will have 2 spare plastic platforms and 2 outfitted with all the legs. I needed to raise my monitor just a tad more than what was provided. So, I ordered another one just so I can raise my other stand.",3
92390,"Ok read... fun little book, and easy to read. Not sure I can give it more than 3 stars simply because those attracted to its message will have come to it for a purpose of sorts. It is pleasant and even teases to spark the imagination, but I would need something... else. It points, ha, to something but leaves us in the end wanting more.",3
100737,"The first one I bought didn’t fit right so I purchased another, still no luck. The material is fine and they are the cutest thing ever. The problem is the leg area was too big. My dogs back legs would come out and it was actually a bit dangerous because they would get stuck in the clothing.",3

102381,Did not fit window sill,3
99971,I like the layout of the days in the board and it fits my refrigerator fine. Those are the good points. The bad points are that only 2 of the round magnets actually function. The markers write but won't stay in the board with their magnets (plus they don't mark very well). Overall I'm happy with the board but the accesories are fairly useless. My advice is that if you need accessories don't count on these and be prepared to get some from another source.,3

Eventually he learns that Ven might not be mentally stable and that she would do anything to keep Brandon in her life for financial stability. So, he tries to stay away from her to save his marriage. The story is more focused on bringing the dark side of the Asian culture and in such a way that people who truly appreciate it may feel offended. The continent has a diversified culture and offers a lot of things that can be appreciated about. The story line and the author’s writing skills makes few scenes in the story enjoyable.",3

My cable are 16 gauge, and I found I have no use for all the small tubes, so before you bought it, make sure you have to use all the size, some is really small.

Update......At first I have this a one star rating. But the manufacture got in touch with me and sent me a replacement and I haven’t had any issues with it. It has been a good backup battery,3

94474,"I ordered this as a good layering piece and it does a good job at that. Love how it covers my bra straps and cleavage. Overall, the camisole is pretty, looks sexy and the fabric feels good. It's the lace that is stiff and scratchy. I have washed it a few times but the lace is still stiff as a board. I will still wear this one because it looks so pretty, but probably won't buy it again.

92793,"Well written book, though content didn't get me as excited as I thought. A huge chunk of the book was on race and gender. I thought it overpowered the book, but I understand this is her reality. For reference, I am a black woman also, so I can relate. Overall, didn't agree with her approach to sex, relationships, and finances in relationships. If anything, the book makes me appreciate how different individuals are, how different our childhood and backgrounds are, and how that shapes us. Still love me some Gabrielle Union :)",3

96321,"I love Black Panther as a character and I felt this book did him justice. I also liked the way the book showed the political struggle the panther had.

116873,"These would be pretty fantastic gloves if they fit better. I got XL sized gloves and they fit all of my fingers perfectly.

113976,Not really sure about how much use I have for the really big bags. The zippers are not great. I mainly use them for packing and transporting kids' stuff that I want to have air. I don't use them in the washing machine as much. The mesh is very fine.,3

It was pretty uncomfortable walking like that at first, and I would’ve returned them the first day if I knew it’d take this long for the strap to get back to normal.

84069,"Comes nicely packaged, but the build quality is nothing exceptional. It feels like a most of it is held together with glue similar to cyanoacrylate, which doesn't have much flex /impact resistance, without using screws. For the price, I would have liked to see an extra gasket, or at least for the one supplied to have been thicker. It is honestly pretty thin, which seems like it would be more prone to tearing. Also, it's not going to provide much cushion against the rigid edge of the polycarbonate main cylinder which, by design, will be pressing firmly against the body. My final gripe with this is that again, for the price point, this really should have been USB rechargeable; not even including a couple of AAA's just seems downright cheap, on the manufacturer's part.",3
82315,great graphics. Sad that you do not have xxl. I wear large and the xl really hugs me. I can wear it but for a tshirt I would like it a bit roomier.,3

The instructions that come with it are inadequate. I googled how to use similar products and watched you tube videos. Also, it is pretty uncomfortable once you get a good suction. I have a pretty high pain tolerance so I can stand it for a couple minutes. Now for the good: It does work. My lips stay plumped for about 2-3 hours. I wanted to see what I would look like if I got injections and now I know. I have not bruised at all like some of the other reviews have said. Overall, I'm happy I bought it.",3

I would say this, the material for this chair is not that bad for its price. It's smaller than what I expected. I'm 5'5 and the head rest part is shorter than my head when I sit. I'm skinny and weigh 140 lbs and the chair has just enough space to fit me. The padding is not soft but im not expecting anything more considering its price. Im still using it tho for everyday gaming. Not like my back gonna break if i use this chair but If u want comfort then this is not the chair u want to buy.

10646,"I just received my tree bags in the mail this weekend. I was excited to finally put my tree away and use these brand new bags. I bought the 2 large storage tree bags to break down my 9' tree and separate it into two bags so there would be no capacity issue. The handles may be heavy duty reinforced, but the remaining stitching of the bag is worthless. My tree comes in 4 parts. I put the middle two sections in one bag, zippered the bag and the seam split. The bottom section (largest and heaviest part of the tree) and the very top of the tree (smallest part) fit nicely in one bag, however when I went to zipper it up, one of the zippers fell off. I was glad there was a zipper on the other end of the bag to close it properly. I was not very happy with the product and I specifically bought two so I would not have this seam rip issue. To have the zipper just fall of the end of the other bag without even trying to close it was very disappointing.",1

So when we started running low in March of this year, I made sure to order the exact same product. We did not need to open the second box until a couple weeks ago. I knew something was wrong when I pulled out the very first bag. The plastic was different and it didn't have any ""give"" to it. Needless to say, every single one of them has ripped so far and over very stupid reasons. The corner of an Oreo bag made a 6 in tear and all I did was pick the trash bag up to move it 5 feet away. We are 10 for 10 on damaged trash bags. The worst part... We have a lot of cats. Several times now the torn bags have spilled dirty cat litter all over the floor.",1

My entire house is hardwood except for 2 large thin low pile rugs which this thing doesn't even clean. And the intelligent ""sensors"" that prevent it from hitting walls is BS. It literally runs full speed into walls and then stumbles for a second once the bumper is hit, moves an inch to the side and runs into the wall again. Look at the pictures of paint scraping off, that was before the stair carnage. 1st time I used it the damn thing stayed under my kitchen table for 20+ minutes despite me pulling all the chairs out. The manual makes no sense and is written in gibberish. The dust bin is literally TOO BIG for it's suction power. After 2 90 minute runs only then is the dust bin over half full and it seems to only really pick up hair. I want a refund.",1

17347,"It my own fault for not looking more closely, I just assumed it was the same design as the Apple sport band but it’s totally different. See the photo attached- the black band is the official Apple one. The main thing is just that the peg points inward toward your wrist and is uncomfortable. It’s also awkward to put on since you’re trying to pull the male end toward the female instead of the other way around. The holes are slightly too small for the peg and you really have to force it. Pretty disappointing, but like I said it’s really my own fault for not looking closer at the pictures.",1

28581,"I initially loved this armband however there is one very GIANT flaw: the way it connects is not via a magnet, but rather 2 small little clips that hold the metal square which have indentations on the sides. The problem is, if running or moving your arms in any way, the fit is not snug and the weight of the phone (I have an iphone 7) pulls the metal up and away from the backplate and it makes a clicking noise...with every single arm movement. It is driving me crazy! If that small circle in the center is actually a magnet, it is not nearly strong enough to do anything with real movement. If it had a powerful magnet that would actually keep the 2 metal pieces from separating, it would be great. Very bummed. I bought a new case just to be able to use this (my old case was textured and thus it wouldn't adhere). One other thing that bothers me is constantly having the metal square on the back on the phone. It's slippery when you put the phone down face up and any gripping quality of your case is irrelevant, unless you put your phone facedown and can't see the screen. And, pressing the home button while flat on a table and the phone tips/rocks, which is also just an annoyance to be aware of.",1

Amazon, thankfully, accepted my exchange on this hose, even though it was outside of the return window. But now, I am about 15 days into my second hose, and I just can't take the kinks! Literally kinks just by pulling it out. I am returning this hose and buying a hose that is more than twice the price of this one - and 30' shorter! Hoping that 'more money' doesn't equal 'more problems' in this scenario. I, for one, am completely done buying these multi-ply hoses. I am going to invest more in heavy duty, all rubber hoses, and hope that they last longer than a month! Any hose brand that claims ""never kink"" - either in the product title or product description, is a liar - and most likely, their hose kinks worse than any hose you've ever owned!

The thing was very heavy and I was not about to attempt to find a box to put it in to return (as the box it came in had to be completely destroyed to get this out as they had taped and stapled all the pieces to the inside of the box) so we just put that corner in the back and used some extra long deck screws to try to pull them together as best we could. I emailed Suncast and have yet to hear a response after over 2 months so that was not a mark in their favor either.

52932,Product works well and throws the snow a good distance. However upon my third use of the product there is one tiny screw that holds the handle on. This screw fell out and because the handle is adjustable and the screw only has about 3 threads to hold the screw in when the screw came out it stripped the threads making it impossible to get a new screw in to hold the handle on the machine.,2

I was hoping this would be like the Sesame Street I remember (not completely Elmo-centric, but very kid friendly with lots of Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Grover, Ernie and Bert, etc..). It's not. It's like a mix between sketch comedy and some educational bits. Interesting to see how the show originated and to see life in the 1970s, but not what I was looking for and not what I remember from the 80s. Also, each disc only has one full episode. And the disc starts with a warning that it's for adults and not appropriate for today's preschoolers. I haven't noticed anything inappropriate, per se, but as mentioned above it's just not as kid-focused as the show was when I grew up or is now.",2

It was told it would be delivered one day the we received a message that it was delayed so when it finally gets to my daughter, the box is totally in shambles. It wasn't taped up good at all, dents all in the box and my daughter had to ask the clerk in the mail station to give her some tape just to take the bottom of the box up enough so it would the printer wouldn't fall out the bottom before she could get it home. Then she opens it up and finds that the copy paper we purchased was opened and pretty much all the paper was outside the package. What in the world has happened?

The thought that you can put the pads under the rear rollers and slide back into position (as per the instructions) is a farce. Between the weight of the fridge, and the rubber of the pads, they simply do not slide on the floor. At all. They sit put and the rollers simply roll right over the small top lip of the pad. I even tried to oil the floor, hoping they would glide on a slick surface. No, Ended up having to place the fridge in place, and with the aid of a helper, tilt it forward and push the rear pads into place with a stick while looking under the fridge with a flashlight. Then (much easier), tilting the fridge backwards and placing the front pads in place. Bottom line is this... they do seem to work well, but installing them was a pain in the neck. Almost too much so.",4

I can't give a rating on durability because I have not had the case very long (about a month) It seems to be durable. I have had similar cases that have lasted a long time. The phone does not fall out of the case and I like the raised edge around the face of the phone to prevent screen cracking.

Put together dresser, desk, nightstand and other apt items no problem. Cons: needs a multi blade small hand saw had to buy one separately. Also doesn’t come with basic screws/nails for hanging pictures or any electrical or duct tape. Adjustable wrench would also be a plus. All in all a decent set for the price. Just know what you need when comparing - no one needs a 100 piece set where they count items you will never use.",4
157049,"This is a lovely set of 10 fancy fashion doll dresses for 11.5 inch dolls. The dresses are handmade with Velcro closures, and in random colors and styles. I like that they fit both newer and older style barbie dolls, and that the Velcro closures make them easy to put on and remove. They are of decent quality and the assortment I received is very nice, without any repeats, although four dresses do have the same bottom lace. I had to trim a couple of threads that were sticking out but nothing major, and the Velcro closures feel quite strong. I received the following dresses in my set: 1 red dress with lots of lace and a bow with hearts on the top, 1 dress with a white top and layered ruffles in purple, pink, and blue, 3 blue dresses, 1 with multi-colored metallic droplets covering the dress, 1 with a bow around the waist and pink dotted lace, 1 with a neck ruffle and pink and white floral lace, 1 white dress with silver butterfly wings on the top, 2 purple dresses with different styles of lace trim on the top, and pink and white floral lace on the bottom, and lastly 2 pink dresses, 1 with lace and darker pink on the top, and pink and white floral lace on the bottom, and 1 with sequined ruffles. I like this set of dresses a lot, and I would definitely recommend it to others.",4

This is good seller and you have nothing to lose by trying this product. If it works, then that's awesome. If not, you can get a refund. That being said, this product did not help our dog.

I used the old snap rings, shim, and nut. The splash guards inside the wheel well and the front of the engine needed to be removed, to get at the compressor from below. A number of the plastic clips broke and needed replacing. The A/C Compressor didn't need to be removed, but needed to be unbolted from the engine to create space to remove the pulley and coil. Needed a fairly narrow set of 8"" external snap ring pliers to remove the coil. 6"" didn't get deep enough, adjustable square nose pliers didn't have enough space to open.

125386,I can’t mark anything for durability yet bc I’ve only had it a few days. But the case exceeded my expectations when I was searching for a soft jelly like feel type of case. I went with the softer more pastel yellow. Which is incredibly cute but I should have went with more of a mustard for my personal style. The open front case made for easy installation. Previous cases similar in the past are all jelly like silicone through and through. This one caught my attention as soon as I opened the package due to the back part which my phone sits on is lined with a thin layer of suede or a suede like material. This has been the best case I’ve gotten for my iPhone. If you have a tempered screen then the jelly case is the perfect amount of protection. I will look into more colors and variety and will definitely look at this seller first.,4
124001,Seems to be good quality and roomy enough for everything I need to carry.,4
143676,It’s light weight but big enough to hold a small wallet and your phone,4
145911,This complete is overall very nice and for a beginner deck is it honestly the best price. But I have to say that out of the five I’ve bought before this one had trucks that could not be used. The trucks did not even have grooves on them for the wheels nut to screw on too. This was very disappointing but has only happened to me once.,4

153070,"Not bad, pretty efficient when you replace the pad the it comes with, with filter floss. I have a 7.5 gallon planted cube and this thing is a lot bigger than I thought. Takes up a lot of space in the back corner of my tank. But I don't plan on leaving this in the tank all the time. I'm only going to use it when start to see a light film on the water surface. It's not asthetically pleasing, but that's just personal preference. Overall, it's a good affordable product that does what it's supposed to do. I wouldn't use it for anything bigger than a 15 gallon tank though. Pros: - works as intended - quiet - clear housing, so you can see what has accumulated inside without having to take it apart. - easy setup and maintenance - adjustable flow rate Cons: - filter pad needs to be replaced (not a deal breaker) - not asthetically pleasing in nano planted tank - the wire is a little short - the plastic material doesn't feel as durable as other brands, so I would handle with care during maintenance. But only time will tell if can hold up.",4

Both keyboard and mouse travel well so I like that, but there doesn't appear to be a power switch on the mouse, and that would be handy. Also the DEL key is in a different spot then what I'm used to, so that took a bit to get accustomed to. The keyboard sometimes skipped a beat but I re positioned the dongle to a spot closer to the keyboard and that seem to cure that issue.",4

I love that these make it easier to see how much product I have left and also get every last bit of product These are also significantly more hygienic than the jars and bottles than my items originally came in. My only gripe with these is that the lids pop off the bottles quite easily. I wish they were a bit more snug so I wouldn't have to be so careful when I pack them in a bag for travel.",4

151972,"Little taste, but that is exactly as desired, as this product that does not have a bunch of flavor and sugar additives. Very high protein content relative to the same scoop amount as other products.",4
137682,Very easy to use and cuts close to the head. Decent price for the quality I would recommend this product.,4
144428,"Its a great game. But, it's a bit grindy so play with friends.",4
137300,I like it because it looks different. It works perfectly.,4
125447,"Work well! They are a little slimmer/flimsier than ones I’ve used in the past, but that did make them easy to slide not only on the key but also on the key ring. The colors are definitely a bit more neon than I would have thought, but that’s fine! They do their job of easily distinguishing my keys.",4
150041,"This product is easy enough to install. I’ve been using it as a door sensor for under 2 months and am starting to notice an increased notification lag or missing notifications too (door opening but not closing for example which is a bit alarming). Not sure what the reason. Could be that the batteries are already running low, it not likely to be the WiFi because i got a great setup.",4
123509,"Briefly said; this is a great computer fan, but the structure is too tall for my taste. This made having one hand up on the keyboard and the other one much lower on the mouse, a very uncomfortable and weird position.",4
152480,Love them! Bought to laser engrave and they turned out perfectly. I was kind of taken back when they arrived and saw that it wasn't wood but done type of soft paper. But after laser engraving my company's logo on the front it looks perfect.,4
134699,"Really easy to install. Looking great in the dining table. More stable than expected. The only thing that could be better is probably the paint, because it got a tiny scratch on one of the legs. But barely noticeable. Very happy with the result.",4
152041,"Really good brushes. I was happy with the purchase, and I was really happy with the price. Highly recommend them if you're looking to increase your brush collection without spending a ton. I got what I paid for, and more! I love the knock off beauty blender, and it does a great job! They hold and apply makeup well. I have used several times and have not lost any bristles.",4
120161,"Fits as expected, but rides up sometimes which is annoying. Fabric quality as expected.",4
146667,"The hat is of good quality fit ok. The only concern I have is the sun screen shade for your neck. If you do not want to use the shade there is no place to put it,if you put in the hat it sticks out all over",4
144306,"The fit was nice. Like the wide straps, although it would be nice to have something to keep them in place without being too tight.",4
126033,Works well for printing,4

134369,"I haven’t yet finished this book ,I am embarrassed to say although I am enjoying it so much I think I am trying to stretch it out . I have really enjoyed reading about Roberts early days and his family and friends and how his love for music really became his driving force for his life. I love that he was just a fan of rock and roll and blues and just decided to try to be a singer and then just was! I think that’s everybody’s dream . So much Amazing stuff in here it’s a must if you are a real Robert Plant fan .",4
