174698,Especially for anyone who might be in an abusive relationship or has experienced one in the past. Good book and would recommend it. It's difficult to come away and not get something out of it and how persons can easily get entrenched in abusive relationships and the patterns that go with it. KP,5
194368,I am about an 18w and i ordered the 2xl and it fit perfect. One strap didn’t want to fit in the designed hole so i flipped it around to go in the other end and it worked. I am very pleased with this bathing suit and received a lot of compliments,5
189276,"Love them. Comfortable, durable.",5
190637,I absolutely love this mirror! Great product for the price! And perfect for my vanity. I was definitely surprised at the quality of this mirror!,5
175146,My son cannot stop watching this video.,5
178218,Absolutely like new with the latest ios. Could not have hoped for more.,5
178736,This product is better than any expensive eye make up in large stores. Will purchase again,5
171197,Love this product ! Bought it for our upcoming Disney trips as well as the summer since our old one was very bulky and hard to pack. It actually mists not just sprays you with water and the fan is very powerful! Can’t believe how compact and handy it is - 2 thumbs up!,5
165940,I wish I bought these sooner. I noticed a significant savings in just a month as I used to leave to lights burning 24/7 in the front and back yards. These LED lights are very bright in a positive way and help me to easily see my front driveway area as well as my back patio area in the back.,5
185624,Was not able to set it up,5
193502,This works just as it says. Took mins to get hooked up. Great for extending our wifi to our upstairs. Would highly recommend.,5
197782,The quality and thickness are exactly what I hoped they would be. I would buy this again!,5
179450,"Just received the stainless steel spatula set I ordered. Seems to be very good quality, delivered promptly. Time will tell if they hold up to regular use",5
198932,After using these I wouldn’t even consider the fancier twice as expensive self setting ones. If I ever need another set I will buy these again. My family and I go to the dunes all the time and needed these for our truck and camper to get out on the sand. Saved us a good hour or more.,5
177652,"Wonderful product and I will be ordering more,leaves my granite beautiful and shiny, just like I got the granite installed today,I just love this product so much. Thank you AB",5
162863,"I’m 5’2, wear a size 0, weigh 100 lbs and I’m a 36 C. I was worried about the shorts being to big if i ordered the medium.. or the top being to small if I ordered the small, as I am petite and busty. Took a chance on the small and looked hella amazing in it! My arms felt comfortable, and I was able to keep them on without cutting it like follower customers have stated. Love the fact that you can adjust the top to fit your bust! Quality looks amazing and not cheap either. I’m critical in attire and I must say this was nice! Buy it. If your measurements are similar to mine buy the small : )",5
19722,Product was leaking inside an undamaged box. One of the canisters arrived 1/2 empty due to the leak.,1
5685,Not worth a buck. Just awful.,1
29395,"Definitely not what I thought I was getting. It does not cover as much as the pictures show (and I have a short torso), it rolls down, and didn't smooth or flatten anything. Instead it made me look round and pregnant. I ordered a 3X and you can tell they are made for smaller people, not truly for bigger girls that have a little more to smooth out. Very disappointed.",1
30774,Horrid product. So disappointed that I chose this over a new iPad. iBooks (iPad) Have much better features and you don't have to deal with crappy advertising blasted all over the home screen as the fire tablet apparently does. Bought another for gift and am embarrased to give it now.,1
37991,"I contacted the seller and will update this once they respond...if they do. I ordered two strands of lights. On the first one, the last 3 feet didn't light up. This was annoying, but I was planning to hide that portion of the lights anyway. On the second strand, ONLY the first 6 feet lit up. That means almost 90 feet DIDN'T.",1
12226,Received an empty bag,1
21765,The product is not what was advertised! Looks like it was from $1 store,1
12120,This order was dropped in the middle of my driveway. We are in a weather pattern of pop up showers everyday. When I returned home I found the package not safely secured by the garage or the covered front patio. Absolutely unacceptable and Amazon the delivery Person should be fired and held accountable,1
24353,I got one which is made in China. It's not from Finland as its advertising.,1
24016,"Used it once. Put charger on. Never started again, junk",1
28281,Not very good. Did not meet my expectations. The worst experience. Would give it no stars if I could !!! Not high quality. Not what i expected wanted.,1
13902,The worst water jug I've ever bought. After 3 uses the lid no longer screws onto the bottle. Making the jug utterly useless. I recommend you look elsewhere for a water jug.,1
13889,Instructions are not clear! While following the manual one of the panels which were screwed on one end but not the other fell and so it snapped!,1
15854,"Horrible customer service, ordered this item 2 months ago and still haven’t received it.",1
33385,"Im bummed as they earbuds do not stay in place, seems like bose would be such a good brand..its poorly designed at least for my ears which are not abnormally big or small",1
16490,"Cheaply made. Shoe glue all over sides of sole. A found a string hanging, I went to rip it off and it started unraveling the inside of the shoe! Worst shoes I’ve ever bought. Not comfortable at all. I bought because someone said she was a nurse and wore them with no pain during clinicals... I don’t know how. No arch support at all. Don’t waste your money",1
66584,"You get what you pay for with this record player. Turntable itself feels light and made of a thin metal. The arm is metal which is nice but the lever to adjust the needle height dosnt work, causing the needle to fall on its own. It assembles easily and plays out of the box. At lower volumes it sounds good with the included speakers but at higher volumes it falls apart, so I would only suggest to use it in smaller rooms. Also out of the box one of the speakers play much quieter than the other, after switching them and getting new wires nothing seems to work, and with no balance control on the system I may need to get new speakers all together. I wouldn’t recommend this record player, all in all very cheaply made, can’t imagine it will withstand the long term",2
55363,Returned. Daughter didn’t like them,2
66870,Not what I expected ... but I gave it as a gift,2
76796,With all the great reviews I thought this would be a great bath bomb. Instead I found these had little to no scent to them at all. They don't fizz very well either. They do have some moisturizing ability and some do change the water colors but it can't make up for the lack of scent in these things.,2
63374,"Tasted very average, I think. The chocolate arrived in good shape, not smashed or leaking. The chocolate was very dark, but I was expecting something really indulgent, different, and yummy for the price. It didn't really taste buttery or indulgent.. I was disappointed.",2
71050,These shoes were very ill-fitting. They have absolutely no shape to them... sizing is off. Definitely not worth the price. I have returned them.,2
40418,For some reason the flavor really brought me to the holidays and Christmas time in the winter really good flavor but the coloring is bright green and it’s very grainy Textured I am really not a fan but maybe a holiday treat,2
74249,Not sure how or why but there is seepage. The floor still gets wet beneath the pad,2
72894,"I'm really disappointed in this product. I like it (keyboard works well, etc.), but it cracked my screen. I have had my 4th generation iPad since 2012 and it has always been in mint condition... until I got this cover with the keyboard. I discovered a crack on my screen this morning, and I'm pretty bummed. I've never dropped my iPad and am super gentle with it. If my iPad was newer, I'd be much more upset - but I'm just upset that I bought this cover and now my screen is cracked. I can only guess that it's because of the keyboard and no cushion in between the screen and the frame of the keyboard? Who knows.",2
77335,I did not expect this to be such ridiculously flimsy plastic: it’s like something you’d get in a pack fir birthday favors. Not high quality and in my opinion both with nearly $12.,2
77161,"The light seems nice except that the 2,400 lumen description is completely bogus. Not even close. It's no brighter than a 400 lumen headlamp. Otherwise, it would be a great product only if described correctly.",2
59896,"Quality of construction is OK but they are NOT BURLAP. They're some kind of nylon plasticky feeling junk. I need them today, otherwise I would return them and reorder. Not happy at all. I am using them in my business and I'm embarrassed to use these.",2
76770,"I purchased this laptop with the expectation of fast internet connection. I have a 400 mbS internet speed from my provider, my phone is steady at 320 mbs speed and laptop does not exceed 200 mbs speed, so, my phone is faster than the laptop. I tried getting help from Dell since at first it didn't exceed 49 mbs and they helped me get to 200, then they turned me over to the software department which sold me a package of $150, service and software. After almost 2 hours with them on phone and laptop they actually slowed my speed even more and then admitted that the laptop does not have the capacity to go any faster, I was fuming. BOTTOM LINE... NOT WORTH THE MONEY",2
44512,It didn’t came with the screw to put the handle on! Disappointed.,2
68213,I love the jacket however I am a size 6-8. I ordered a large and it’s too tight and too short.,2
76199,"It’s a great body shaper, it does as it should but I’ve worn it like 3 times and the thread is coming out and leaving holes in the seam.",2
152982,There OK for the money,4
154683,"First off, I didn't love the smell. It wasn't bad but it reminded me of something that's medicated. I was disappointed with the size of the bottle thinking that it won't last long but I only needed a small dime size to get a good lather. After drying my hair, it felt so soft and silky. I don't think it's because I changed to a different shampoo because I do that pretty regularly so that I don't get buildup from the same product. I haven't used it long enough to see if it would help with my hair loss yet. I'll update when I run out.",4
127551,Kind of wanted it to extend forward a bit more but it does a good job of holding my lights,4
142625,"I would recommend this, my baby wouldn't sleep in his crib after going from his bassinet so I bought this to make it softer and it worked. he loves it, the only thing I don't like about it is its shorter than the crib and regular crib mattress so theres a big gap at the other end of the crib and he likes to roll down there and then he gets stuck (he is 6 months)",4
149857,"Good product,nice work for nighttime driving.But the case look like old,has a little scratch........",4
141083,"Good screen, I like the matte but it’s almost too thick? That or I’m not used to pressing down harder. Fresh out the box",4
134936,"Screwed right in on my Buell Blast. Was tired of looking at my shoulders in the stock mirrors, and these I can see behind me much better. They vibrate the same as any but my bike is a thumper and I don't expect miracles. They are definitely plastic, and very light weight. I first thought they felt cheap but having them installed now for weeks I don't notice how they feel, just how they look. Looks good.",4
132626,"I have a young, year old cat who loves this toy. Often before bed, I toss it around, and I love the exercise he gets. I noticed he sleeps better, as well. Sometimes, I attach two of the feather bunches. One that is soft and fluffy, and the other type that is thinner and more rigid. He loves the combo. I can't fault the company for the beating the feathers take, as he is pretty rough with it. However, my frustration has been with the wand. The first one I had lasted about six months before it had issues. The second one didn't even last a month, so now I am on my third one in two months. I am giving this third one a try, and if I have the same issue, I will start looking at a competitor. I really do like the quality of the feather, which makes this choice difficult. I do have to give props for the price, if it were more expensive, I would have already gone to a competitor.",4
154264,"As advertised, no surprises.",4
136328,"Nice novel; I enjoyed it,",4
157375,"It is pretty on my wall but not so easy to install, the best way to install is carefully remove white paper from clear transfer paper and lay it on a flat surface sticky side up. Remove clear paper from decal and lay the whole decal page on the transfer paper and use a credit card to smooth it out removing and bubbles, using a ruler snd scissors to cut the bottom scroll off. Remove the white paper from decal and place the decal on your desired location use credit card to smooth out and peel transfer paper off making sure your letters are flat. Would have given a five but the directions were not easy",4
157813,"Best solar lights purchased for lighting my driveway gate at night. Motion detection is extremely effective, am pleased with the lights.",4
125792,"I'm changing my 2 star to four, left a 2 star because the tilt could not hold weight of laser. Decided to take it apart again when I had more time to mess with it, started looking at it and realized the pan/tilt handle is also the lock for the tilt, just have to twist it. Facepalm. User error on my part. Works great now.",4
130689,Unless you have darker very tan skin I recommend the translucent (white) color instead of cool beige but works well as far as makeup setting.,4
130751,"I like everything about this knob except the color. The picture on amazon looks like it should match my Penn perfectly, but when I received it, it was way more orange gold than pale gold like a Penn. Other than that, the fit and finish is good, the bearings are smooth, everything is serviceable and the install is fairly straight forward. If the color was matching the picture it would have 5 stars.",4
142057,"Only problem with these light is the adhesive on the backing of the led strip. Had trouble having it stick to surfaces. Other than that great product, no blown lights, no connection issues, remote works like it should.",4
82648,"Quality of the book was good. Only some of the information had details regarding the different oils, the rest was referencing products made by Young Living. I was hoping for more recipes than just product references. It is more a training book for a Young Living representative to sell their products.",3
114594,to soon to tell about how it works,3
105534,These bottles are okay but they leak profusely from the lid. No matter how tight!,3
86323,These start to chip and crack after a month or two of normal usage. Comes with stickers to help with mounting,3
80731,"I was really disappointed by this stuff. Some reviews said it was great for fine hair, but unfortunately, it made my very fine hair greasy and weighed it down. I’ve used a very small amount and tried it for a few weeks, but it just isn’t working for me. It would probably be ok for semi-fine hair, but my search for a shine and anti-frizz product that works on truly super fine hair continues!",3
81954,"Usually buy Keen and only Keen, but these broke after the third time wearing these. I'll buy a different kind of Keen.",3
91025,Strong magnets. You'll need to order spice labels if you use Indian spices. One big problem is the wall mounting system. I needed to drill 2 holes and mount to cabinet as the sliding mount provided is not secure.,3
107481,So these shorts are not cut like the pictures. The leg opening is oblong from side to side. Not front to back. So you dont get that natural stretch on the side. Instead it kinda flares out. Not really flattering. The material is soft and super stretchy. I'm debating to keep it.,3
83499,I have read all the wonderful books in this family but I'm sad to say that this one was just good not great. What happened to dialogue between the couple - most of the relationship was in their thoughts not in what they said. What happened to bringing in the family members and the fun of their dialogue. What happened to make the heroine such a whiner - the constant I'm not good enough. Not to mention the contradictions on what's said in ome chapter such as the great mother that leaves her son alone overnight by himself while shes on a date. The Male characters had the alpha attitude these books are known for and that saves the book.,3
118965,"These are great for an area where they aren’t being bumped into. They work great & look great, but are easily knocked off the base",3
107767,"Very cute, but very low quality. Ordered this for a birthday gift for my niece. She had it a week and I was embarrassed to find out the seams are already coming apart in several spots. I don’t recommend this prouduct. Very disappointed with this purchase!",3
114035,"Perfect case except fingerprints and smudges appear constantly, no matter how clean my hands are. The one downside of the satin smooth plastic and dark color options.",3
113245,"Not exaclty what I was expecting. Works fine, but too bulky for me.",3
118957,"These are great, unless you use oil in your hair. They do last longer than any other brand I’ve tried so far. I wish they were clear instead, but cute colors.",3
91300,The nails sent with the package don’t match! Nails are too small for the holes.,3
90413,"Definitely not matte black, it's gloss but I can't be bothered returning it. Also does not Fit my 2014 GLI",3
