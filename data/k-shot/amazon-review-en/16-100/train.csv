199658,"I purchased this tracker due to my daughter being a new driver and concerns about her safety. It took seconds to install and I am not a tech wiz. I dowloaded the app to my phone and can also track using my laptop. Within minutes from installation, the tracker synced with the app and I was able to track her car. It allows me to see her speed, received notifications if there is sharp turning or braking, and also provides a history of where she has been. I can get exact coordinates of her location and times which has already come in handy in a big way. We received a call from the police department that there was an accident and the person who was driving hit another vehicle and drove away. The vehicle was similar to my daughter's and she was in the same town when the accident occurred! I was able to pull up the tracking history and see she was not in the same location where the accident occurred at that time through the tracker. Also, her vehicle did not show any damage thankfully. The tracker saved us a lot of hassle and concern. PS She is unaware the tracker is on her vehicle. If for some reason it is removed, we would be notified as well as the unit will send a message that it has been tampered with. Overall, very pleased with this product.",5

178838,These were great for mounting handguns and tools or anything else you want to hang up or conceal. Durable rubber coating prevents your items from being scratched. Works as advertised,5
180221,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. It was a big update for her gaming rig and really improved her graphics! She said she noticed a big difference. It's been very reliable so far for many weeks of Skyrim (and other gaming).,5
195331,More in the head and less in the shower floor and drainage. I like that this product comes through for me. I have tried a couple other products before but I have never been this content with just a single one. I would absolutely recommend this.,5

22705,"I have ordered this product three times. The first time I got my product as ordered. The second and third time the shipper only sent one box even though they were supposed to send two. I can understand making the mistake once, but to do the same mistake twice is a pity and a shame. I would leave 5 stars for the actual boxes, and 0 stars for the person in shipping who needs reading glasses.",1
30399,The hair brush came with strands of hair in it already!!! Why would I pay for it brand new but get a used set.,1
9733,In December I purchased two LxTek five pack 952XL in anticipation of a planned distribution for a small nonprofit mission group that i work with. After some delay the printed project got underway. When printing began I discovered that only one out of the four 952XL black cartridge was functional. A 75% failure rate is much too high for any product. Unfortunately due to the delays in the project my time for recourse through Amazon Prime also passed. I love the idea of reused/re-manufactured cartridges but there should be some checks on re-usability before marketing.,1
16382,"Bought in October...Burned up in January. The blender worked great....until it didn't. It was used once a day from October to January. Each morning, I made a Rocket-Fuel Latte. No ice, no nuts, nothing dense. One morning, it began to make funny noises, the blender slowed down, and as I turned it off, it began to smoke and produce a very odd smell. Braun customer service seems to be set up to deny claims. I still don't have a new blender-- they only want to give me the bottom part, but the things that turn the blades are locked up, too. Still in limbo using a cheap blender from WalMart.",1

77027,"After researching all vanity tables, I decided to go with this one for its price and dimensions. It‚Äôs cute, and I would definitely give it 4-5 stars, but the smell is horrible! We assembled it 4 days ago, and the room still smells like toxic paint or something. The minute my boyfriend opened the box, my yes started tearing up. I really wish we hadn‚Äôt assembled it already.",2

58169,"This is usually my favorite brand! These are very cute and comfortable, but the first pair broke in a few hours of wearing them at work. (I have a desk job) I was sent a replacement pair, but I've been afraid to wear them, as I don't want the same thing to happen. ü§û Update - I've changed my rating to 2 stars, as the replacement pair have broken as well. They lasted 2 days. Very disappointed.",2
60188,Order at least one size up. Material is cheap. Stiff and you can't take photos or type emails as advertised.,2
65554,I hate to review anything especially when I have received it a few hours back. Two stars because the packaging is either very poor or I have received an open package. That too one day later than what was promised.,2
48149,"These are HUGE! My 2 1/2 year old wears an 8, but they are fitting snug. I ordered a size 9 (double checked their size chart), and they are HUGE. See pics for comparison (you can see the 8 and 9 imprinted on each shoe).",2

70454,"I'd love to say that this is a great faucet, and for about 6 months it was. Unfortunately, the faucet head has now failed twice and the replacement took over a month to arrive, leaving me with a barely functional faucet. For a $80 faucet, I might put up with it but this is expensive and frankly pretty poorly engineered.",2
120533,"This is a good product for the price tag. However not a great quality material. However why to complain, it's great for the price tag",4
130342,"Just needed a larger size. The length was great because I'm tall. The cut is great, and the fabric is NOT forgiving. Just be alert.",4

154485,Great product to replace grill cleaning brushes with metal that fall off and cause medical issues. A little hard to keep clean.,4
124385,They are beautiful. The only problem is that I pay 3 times more than their price to blow them.,4
140405,Works great. It came with metal shavings so I cleaned it out be wary when you first use it. Otherwise I'm very satisfied with the product it's what I expected which is great.,4

131184,We have been looking for shower sandals like these for awhile. In stores they are more expensive but I found these on Amazon and he is very happy with them.,4
153591,"So far so good. I bought this to attach to my pack and play for my twins. Definitely does the job. It has 3 modes: on, off, on no music. I gave 4 stars because it must be attached to a hard part of the pack and play. If I try to tighten it on the fabric side, it cannot grip with the weight of the mobile causing it to hang down wayyy to close to baby. Not really a big deal, works fine if you attach to hard area.",4
121657,"These are nice sheets, They washed well and didn't really look wrinkled after drying but they do wrinkle once used on the bed like most other sheets. Still a nice set they are soft and have a nice feel to them. They fit my foam mattress good without slipping off. Would recommend.",4
142611,I LOVED how easy it was to put this together. Usually my husband and I cannot be in the same room after we put furniture together this was a breeze. The only problem was that the king size frame was just a tad to small for the mattress so we just put the little part that doesn't fit at the head so it's not as noticable.,4
136987,"Functional, great price. However, it would be helpful to visualize the files in thumbnails or small photos. I hope you may improve this feature in the future.",4
148230,"It is a great toy and definitely gets the job done. The material is top notch and allows you to control the level of suction. The only reason I gave it 4 starts is because the massage pattern inside could be better. Wish it had more patterns available, like they do for their other products. However, it is great for the price. (Easy clean up, my girlfriend loves that).",4

84606,"3/5 this book lacks structure, world building and a real plot. It's starts real slow and nothing really happens until you are 70% in. Definitely over hyped and doesn't live up to it. Much room for improvement on book 2.",3
97283,"The case is easy enough to install. The screen protector is not. It has a blacked out border for some reason. If you don't line it up perfectly it may obscure your front camera. The touch screen is also less responsive to your touch, especially around the edges. I would recommend purchasing a screen protector from someone else.",3
103912,"I love frankincense. It's my favorite incense. This is not the frankincense you have smelled in churches or other rituals. It smells generically sweet and flowery. Not at all like the musty, smokey scent I am used to. The scent isn't bad, and it's dirt cheap, but you will be disappointed if you are looking for the scent of actual frankincense resin.",3

82357,"I've enjoyed buying the Sierra Club wall calendar for decades. This year was no different - stunning pictures, great size for jotting in appointments and reminders, and a good way to show support for the Club's work keeping the most beautiful parts of our country intact and available for public awe and recreation. And what a good thing I was ordering it for myself, rather than as a Christmas gift, since it arrived with crushed corners and there would not likely be time to return it and take a risk on another one.",3
85212,"Where to start ?:... it took about a month to ship, which really sucked. Once it arrived the package was very flimsy and not very protective also not discreet at all!!! It said TOY in all caps right on the package . The instructions were in Chinese but it did have separate ones In English but very small print ! So small I had to use a magnifying glass just to read them. Works how advertised but I couldn‚Äôt get the remote (which was bigger than I expected) to work until I charged everything fully for a few hours, i does have an indicator light and flashes while charging , I had to sorta plug the dc cable in just right and move it around so that I could make full contact in order for it the charge ( took me about a day to get this thing fully charged ) . Very soft and smooth texture , The head swivels in a circular motion which I didn‚Äôt even know it did, but not to be too graphic it just isn‚Äôt strong enough to do that while it‚Äôs in use , not a very powerful vibration either but it is quiet . It was an ok buy .",3
