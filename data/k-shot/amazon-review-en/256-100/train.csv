199658,"I purchased this tracker due to my daughter being a new driver and concerns about her safety. It took seconds to install and I am not a tech wiz. I dowloaded the app to my phone and can also track using my laptop. Within minutes from installation, the tracker synced with the app and I was able to track her car. It allows me to see her speed, received notifications if there is sharp turning or braking, and also provides a history of where she has been. I can get exact coordinates of her location and times which has already come in handy in a big way. We received a call from the police department that there was an accident and the person who was driving hit another vehicle and drove away. The vehicle was similar to my daughter's and she was in the same town when the accident occurred! I was able to pull up the tracking history and see she was not in the same location where the accident occurred at that time through the tracker. Also, her vehicle did not show any damage thankfully. The tracker saved us a lot of hassle and concern. PS She is unaware the tracker is on her vehicle. If for some reason it is removed, we would be notified as well as the unit will send a message that it has been tampered with. Overall, very pleased with this product.",5

Plus Marlon Bundo is a very fun bunny!! Charlotte Pence has written a great book for children (and adults!!) and Karen Pence has illustrated it with beautiful watercolor pictures of Marlon and some familiar scenes in Washington DC.

186295,"I like this alarm clock. I hate that typical ""alarm clock"" sound, and prefer beeping. However, I really love the music and volume control on this alarm clock. I cannot have any light in the room when I'm trying to sleep, that really bothers me. I was worried as this did not sound like it had a complete ""off"" mode for the light, but I thought I'd try it. There are 4 brightness settings that can be adjusted by the big button the top at any time. I was very happy that the lowest setting is almost completely off. In the night, the lowest setting is almost not visible at all. Additional features I like are the USB ports, which are great for charging my phone. Overall, this alarm clock has great features, is easy to use, and is compact and nice looking. It has a bit of weight to it and rubber feet on the bottom so it doesn't slide around your nightstand. I would highly recommend this alarm clock",5

9733,In December I purchased two LxTek five pack 952XL in anticipation of a planned distribution for a small nonprofit mission group that i work with. After some delay the printed project got underway. When printing began I discovered that only one out of the four 952XL black cartridge was functional. A 75% failure rate is much too high for any product. Unfortunately due to the delays in the project my time for recourse through Amazon Prime also passed. I love the idea of reused/re-manufactured cartridges but there should be some checks on re-usability before marketing.,1
16382,"Bought in October...Burned up in January. The blender worked great....until it didn't. It was used once a day from October to January. Each morning, I made a Rocket-Fuel Latte. No ice, no nuts, nothing dense. One morning, it began to make funny noises, the blender slowed down, and as I turned it off, it began to smoke and produce a very odd smell. Braun customer service seems to be set up to deny claims. I still don't have a new blender-- they only want to give me the bottom part, but the things that turn the blades are locked up, too. Still in limbo using a cheap blender from WalMart.",1

5685,Not worth a buck. Just awful.,1
29395,"Definitely not what I thought I was getting. It does not cover as much as the pictures show (and I have a short torso), it rolls down, and didn't smooth or flatten anything. Instead it made me look round and pregnant. I ordered a 3X and you can tell they are made for smaller people, not truly for bigger girls that have a little more to smooth out. Very disappointed.",1
30774,Horrid product. So disappointed that I chose this over a new iPad. iBooks (iPad) Have much better features and you don't have to deal with crappy advertising blasted all over the home screen as the fire tablet apparently does. Bought another for gift and am embarrased to give it now.,1
37991,"I contacted the seller and will update this once they respond...if they do. I ordered two strands of lights. On the first one, the last 3 feet didn't light up. This was annoying, but I was planning to hide that portion of the lights anyway. On the second strand, ONLY the first 6 feet lit up. That means almost 90 feet DIDN'T.",1
12226,Received an empty bag,1
21765,The product is not what was advertised! Looks like it was from $1 store,1
12120,This order was dropped in the middle of my driveway. We are in a weather pattern of pop up showers everyday. When I returned home I found the package not safely secured by the garage or the covered front patio. Absolutely unacceptable and Amazon the delivery Person should be fired and held accountable,1
24353,I got one which is made in China. It's not from Finland as its advertising.,1
24016,"Used it once. Put charger on. Never started again, junk",1
28281,Not very good. Did not meet my expectations. The worst experience. Would give it no stars if I could !!! Not high quality. Not what i expected wanted.,1
13902,The worst water jug I've ever bought. After 3 uses the lid no longer screws onto the bottle. Making the jug utterly useless. I recommend you look elsewhere for a water jug.,1

16490,"Cheaply made. Shoe glue all over sides of sole. A found a string hanging, I went to rip it off and it started unraveling the inside of the shoe! Worst shoes I’ve ever bought. Not comfortable at all. I bought because someone said she was a nurse and wore them with no pain during clinicals... I don’t know how. No arch support at all. Don’t waste your money",1
22241,These ruined my product! I was excited to use these to make my necklaces look more professional but everything I used them on discolored so bad. I can't sell them now! Don't buy!!,1
17531,I had almost not expectations while buying this product yet it still managed to disappoint me. Incredible. Don't buy anyone anything from Gildan. It's like they didn't tailor these for humans. I would like to see a single person that these t-shirts fit well. Just don't buy them. please.,1

27135,This was a BOXED SET. Supposedly with multiple books. I paid full price for the set and only received one paper back. Very deceitful. Dont buy from this seller.,1
17161,"This is the tenth book, and honestly I am finished with the series and the author. These ""books"" compare to chapters in other authors novels. Consider this, at around $3 each, if you have purchased part one to part ten, you are now in this for $30 and the story isn't finished. I purchase a novel because I want to watch the characters develop, grow, see them overcome hardship and conflict, and I want to escape into their story for however long it takes. I actually enjoy a number of authors that use multiple books to tell a story. Meghan March is a master of this. I wish Hannah the best on her literary journey but I won't be following her or her writing anymore.",1
24582,"We looked all over Amazon for a new set of luggage and finally settled on this set after comparing price and reviews. Our main concern was the durability of the set. Well our fears were realized on our 1st trip. The luggage was nice and light, rolled well, had great space inside but when we picked up our luggage at the baggage claim, the largest one was missing a wheel. It had completely ripped off of the case, exposing the fabric inside the shell. The middle one lost one of the bumpers on it's spine, exposing two metal studs. Luckily United had 2 new suitcases that they swapped out right then and there for us. It just seemed like the better way to go instead of filing a claim and purchasing this set a 2nd time. We really wanted to like the set too...pretty bummed at the quality.",1
30608,Worthless and it doesn’t work,1

11741,"I never received this product. It was delivered to my US postal service mailbox outside my house. My mail carrier said Amazon is not authorized to deliver to mailbox ,,only to door.

5995,"I bought these and only 1 out of 10 signs that I bought was good. The material on the letters that is supposed to glow did not work. It was spotty and I could only see 1 or 2 letters in the dark for the other 9 signs. Very disappointed, plus there is no returns. Do Not Buy!!!!",1
36991,It didnt have the stockings for the outfit,1
20535,The bands are not strong enough. I’m a mid level athlete / fitness female and the black band which is supposed to be the hardest / strongest went around my legs and gave me VERY little resistance in squats and lunges. Poor quality gliding discs...scratched along the floor and did not give smooth transitions.,1
15121,"I did a lot of shopping around and decided on this light because it was the cheapest of the ones with the features I wanted. Not till it arrived with no battery did I find in listing that battery was not included. Perhaps that’s my fault because I didn’t read thoroughly, but I am still pissed because now I have the light I wanted but still can’t use it till I spend more money",1

I switched him to this gradually over the course of a week, mixing his old food and this one together. After getting to full portions of this food, he would get really bad diarrhea. I kept thinking maybe he’d eaten something else, so kept him on this food but it lasted another couple of days. I switched him cold turkey back to Blue Buffalo and immediately the next morning his stool started to improve. Not sure what he is allergic to, but he definitely didn’t tolerate this food. I’m grateful for Amazon’s return policy because this food is not cheap. I will continue to look for another alternative to Blue Buffalo.",1

The pole caps break easily. The net doesn’t even fit around the base of the trampoline. I was unable to get this assembled until my husband returned from a long trip. We just got around to putting it all together after two months. Now it doesn’t even work and parts are breaking. A waste of money. For the money we spent, I could have bought a new trampoline from Sams Club or Costco.",1

6621,I was happy with this cover to begin with but after less than two months it has torn. I tried contacting Amazon and Leader Accessories about the two year warranty and each company tells me to contact the other. Communication with Leader Accessories is not good.

28666,I am rating this way specifically for the iPhone X. I had this exact case for my iPhone 7+ and I liked it so much that I ordered it right away for my new iPhone X. I am very disappointed that when you take the phone with the thin inner case on it does not work for wireless charging. I think anyone who makes accessories for the X should point out that it does not work with wireless charging. Unusable for me. I have two other thin cases that work fine with wireless and even the thick OtterBox does.,1

The ones I received are different altogether. A different color glass, different color lids, and the worst part is that the set I received regularly retails for $15-20 which means I paid double for them.

It's choppy or statistics and then causes the earbuds to shut down and flashes red and blue. Not sure why and they came with little info. I haven't used much because they are pretty thick and don't want to stay in my ears. I read the reviews and was worried this might happen so I bought those ear buddy's to go with. But they only helped some. They still want to fall out. So I have only used a few times while at home. But as of the past week I am having a hard time getting the right one to stay on and work. Every video I played was choppy real annoying to listen to. Not sure if I should buy a replacement one or return looks like I only have till February 11th. I just didnt want to upset hubby by returning they was a gift from him. These would be awesome if just a bit smaller and of course the sound was better in the one that is messing up.",1

I had to stick it twice a day for a week and every time it would fall with a thud, without any bumps and while it was parked at night. Second, the recording feature is all over the place. I liked their button settings which make sense. But after setting it up, the camera records randomly, says the disk is full (even if it's set on loop recording) and after formatting and changing card, still gives the error. The other day I found a bump on my car and when I checked the camera, NOTHING was recorded in the parking mode. So, I'm past the return window and should have tested it before going for a vacation. Seemed like a good product from the reviews. Maybe I got a bad unit. But in any case, check it if you buy it, but LOOK ELSEWHERE for a reliable unit.",1

Check before and after each use.,1
33675,"I bought this to try to balance one of my tires. When I got it I noticed that the unit was not balanced when I put it on a perfectly balanced floor. The bubble would always tilt to one side. I tired to use it and figured I might be able to compensate for that by shimming one side of the unit, but I could not get it to work properly. Part of the problem is that I noticed when you put the tire on there you have to tilt the unit a few times to ensure the weights you have placed on there are actually in the right position. A few tilts and spins would change the location of the bubble and with this unit not being calibrate properly that task was nearly impossible. I contacted the seller and after going back and forth for days, sending pictures, etc. and finally getting frustrated and telling them I will never deal with them again they finally refunded my money and told me to keep the unit. Fortunately the unit is made of aluminum so I can easily recycle, which is the only thing its good for.",1

66584,"You get what you pay for with this record player. Turntable itself feels light and made of a thin metal. The arm is metal which is nice but the lever to adjust the needle height dosnt work, causing the needle to fall on its own. It assembles easily and plays out of the box. At lower volumes it sounds good with the included speakers but at higher volumes it falls apart, so I would only suggest to use it in smaller rooms. Also out of the box one of the speakers play much quieter than the other, after switching them and getting new wires nothing seems to work, and with no balance control on the system I may need to get new speakers all together. I wouldn’t recommend this record player, all in all very cheaply made, can’t imagine it will withstand the long term",2

They do have some moisturizing ability and some do change the water colors but it can't make up for the lack of scent in these things.,2

I discovered a crack on my screen this morning, and I'm pretty bummed. I've never dropped my iPad and am super gentle with it. If my iPad was newer, I'd be much more upset - but I'm just upset that I bought this cover and now my screen is cracked. I can only guess that it's because of the keyboard and no cushion in between the screen and the frame of the keyboard? Who knows.",2

I tried getting help from Dell since at first it didn't exceed 49 mbs and they helped me get to 200, then they turned me over to the software department which sold me a package of $150, service and software. After almost 2 hours with them on phone and laptop they actually slowed my speed even more and then admitted that the laptop does not have the capacity to go any faster, I was fuming. BOTTOM LINE...

45056,"I’m confused by the good reviews on this book. I will say that some of the author’s comments are good enough to assist the reader in their own reflection, but most are plain, lacking insight, and feel rushed...and some are just stupid. Take February 8th for example, where the author says “The next time someone gets upset near you - crying, yelling, breaking something, being pointed or cruel - watch how quickly this statement will stop them cold: ‘I hope this is making you feel better.’ Because, of course, it isn’t.” Face palm. There is nothing remotely Stoic about responding with sarcasm to someone who is upset. I like the structure and premise behind the book so much that I keep wanting it to get better.

They asked for first initial, last initial then middle initial and they obviously should have put the middle initial in the middle but we got ours as the last letter.

This little device has a little bolt and you screw the back on. It will not even leave a tiny hole in your garment, it will damage your garment and leave a large hole in it. I telephone the company and told them that it is regulation size and the eagle globe and anchor look really good,but the back of this device is not for a collar. Do yourself a favor as I will do, go to an Army surplus store in your area and all the branches are there. The lady that I spoke to at this company didn't really give a rip.

53541,"I got a pair of these boots from my son-in-law 8 years ago and loved them. I wore those boots out. After enjoying these boots soo much, I thought another pair were the logical choice. My initial thought when receiving the new pair was ""well...these LOOK similar to my old ones."" They felt a bit cheaper. Not as quality construction. Yet, they may be better, so I gave them a chance. I wear these boots 5 days a week as a security officer. Nothing overly strenuous, an inside job for the most part. After wearing the boots for a couple months, I noticed a crack starting on my left boot, in the crease where my toes bend back. I added boot polish, thinking maybe it was dried out or some issue was there. The crack has gotten worse and I am now seeing the same problem starting on the other boot. I dont know if this was a one off or a fluke, yet it changes my desire to buy 5.11 boots in the future.",2

I like her efforts to not make this a POV book; I really cannot stand POV books because you're just wasting your money on something you already have read. However, the storyline was kind of deja vu, pond intended. Like can we get a new antagonist? I feel this story could have been great but adding the same conflict from previous books of the series into the mix was a complete letdown. I am deeply disappointed. Honestly, I think the reviews on this book is based on her popularity and not this book.",2

I was disappointed with the size of the bottle thinking that it won't last long but I only needed a small dime size to get a good lather. After drying my hair, it felt so soft and silky. I don't think it's because I changed to a different shampoo because I do that pretty regularly so that I don't get buildup from the same product.

Sometimes, I attach two of the feather bunches. One that is soft and fluffy, and the other type that is thinner and more rigid. He loves the combo. I can't fault the company for the beating the feathers take, as he is pretty rough with it. However, my frustration has been with the wand. The first one I had lasted about six months before it had issues. The second one didn't even last a month, so now I am on my third one in two months. I am giving this third one a try, and if I have the same issue, I will start looking at a competitor. I really do like the quality of the feather, which makes this choice difficult.

So the poor printing was simply a bad ink cartridge. My only criticism is that this was clearly aged inventory in Amazon's warehouse - the printer showed with a sale date that was a year ahead of my purchase (and HP nicely updated that with the warranty information) and the ink was close to it's expiration date.

140624,Nice and soft. Not thick enough for an insert.,4
128075,Perfect to expectations.,4
151270,A little narrower than what I've seen before but good quality and comfortable,4
120651,It didn't work for me but my husband will be able to use it.,4
126520,Theses are ok for some things but not as soft as previous one I own. Leaves fuzz on car.,4
145788,Great for moving across the country!,4
124751,"They're great, I only wish the had the big number 2 on the side of the nipple instead of the rim, it's hard to tell the size without searching for it",4
147843,"Pretty nose ring and nicely priced. Material is a little flimsy and there should be a clasp or something to close the ring. Otherwise, I am happy with this purchase.",4
125135,"The kit was good, except for the HDMI cable did not work. I had ordered a second cable from another source so I was able to test. The case, power supply and SD card worked fine.",4
154216,This was a fun game for myself and granddaughters . Had lots of fun with it,4
123212,"Bag is durable and well padded. It's also big enough for most of my hardware. Some hardware may be too big for the bag without completely disassembling it. It can also get difficult to carry if there's too much in it, or if the sizes of the contents allow the bag to bend. If I upgrade, I will probably go with a longer bag/case with at least one hard side and with wheels.",4
134679,"Nice silverware set. They are shiny and well made and does not seems cheap, although they are a tad lighter than what I have expected and the size of large spoon seems too large for me, but overall a very good set for the price. I like the range of the utensil in the set the box is also pretty good, you can use it as a gift too. Good set, great for the price",4
129021,"Very absorbent and soft and good price, just wish I would’ve gone for a more natural fabric choice that breathes a little better but I just use them at night. Cleans easily. Again I just use it for night and it’s perfect for that but they may move around a little too much if you wore them during the day?",4
120532,"Powerful, but too difficult for beginner",4
123183,"This lube is amazing, a little bit goes a long way and the texture and consistency is amazing. It dries a little too fast, but most lubes are like that. The smell is a little funky, kinda smells like a mix of plasitc and strawberries. But overall i would recommend, and i will buy again.",4
120664,Very nice product no issues putting it together. Everything is solid metal. Not sure why anyone would complain about a plastic screw holding the lightning jack. It allows for stand to adjust to your case to fit on to it. Easy enough looks nice. Cords not being built into or power is a plus in my opinion. Easy enough to replace a bad cord in the future.,4
126205,I didn't like it quite as good as the first book but it still had me hooked,4
130219,"Love this wig!! Very little shedding and it very soft. I had to color it and the color turned as very well. Color didn’t take long to reach desired color. I tried using a spray solution of water and conditioner but once it dried, it look dull so I used a spray activator. Curls are nice but I would have preferred them to be a litter looser. Overall it’s a great wig.",4
128477,"A very nice, sturdy messenger bag! Tons of compartments for all your belongings. My iPad and notebooks and folders fit perfectly. The price and style of the bag are win wins!!",4
156083,I actually thought that this was pretty well done. I think these girls may have been naive in their initial expectations but it felt genuine. I think this push/pull between harnessing your sexual power and compromising your personal morals is an important conversation. I also think they displayed an above average consideration of the ramifications of this lifestyle.,4
132869,Satisfied with overall product and timely shipping/packaging. Price was a bit high,4
151791,they were great for a month then they both cracked and got brittle so sad I was a danner fan for many years the best hunting boots in the industry 🤠,4
137042,Wish there were all stripes,4
153970,Pretty good product for the cost! I took apart the end to fit in my grey water tank. Works perfect except water sits in the drain,4
141650,Very comfortable and cute and definitely go to bra.,4
148994,Better than most of the Ana costumes I saw in the stores. Th only issue was the hem came loose and got all frayed.,4
157581,I found this book interesting. Young adults and older would enjoy this book. It does have sexual content and some cursing. A real folklore and fantasy.,4
143336,I purchased a similar bracelet for a teenage girl's baptism gift. I saw this and wanted it for myself. It's very pretty.,4
157061,"Works well as advertised. Batteries last approx 6 months, but considering cost, I'm good with that! Perfect for my Grandson when he stays here!! I love the temp in the room, and the day and dates shown!",4
129469,"great fit. too long for me personally, I'm 5'2. other than that super cute and comfortable. definitely will purchase in other shades.",4
159929,"I ordered the black, wish they would have had a flat black as well as glossy",4
136814,"These are a little lighter weight than our larger older splash guard, but they get the job done and it's nice to have the smaller sizes for out smaller pans, it makes fitting everything on the stove easier.",4
149582,The black plastic screw on this gun came broken off. I don't want to return the whole kit but it's there a way to get just this gun replaced? I can't find contact info for seller. Thanks!,4
140738,Allows you to bring up a laptop to a monitor or a television. Does it purpose fairly well but every now and then I will have a little bit of trouble with it. Remember to install the drivers or you will have a rough time with it.,4
128384,This was an excellent book. The only way it could have been improved upon was with pictures throughout. Just the right length of a story and a great introduction to some of the major players in this bit of history,4
141180,"The product is great although the brush would fall off occasionally. But I use it daily twice a day. The price is high. I wish I can compare it with cheaper brand. Other than the occasional fall off on the brush, it does what it claims and looks great.",4
146619,Very comfortable and well made. I didn't even need to break them in. Excellent work shoes.,4
134848,great fitness tracker works good have not had any problems whit the charging or power love that it works with the app to keep my data so i can look back at my patterns in sleep and my heart rate helps motivate to walk more for more steps to reach goals that you can set. Dose not fit children it is a little to big for their wrist but fits adults perfect.,4
139867,We actually used a garden hose and it filled up faster and easier. Everyone that has worked out with it has liked it!,4
127181,"The machine is wonderful. It is fast, boots instantly and there is plenty of memory and hard disk space. I use it for engineering work (CAD and structural calculations) and it is replacing a previous two monitor HP rig. I work with two programs simultaneously and the monitor is fantastic at that. My only complaint is the input devices HP includes with it. The mouse is awful for CAD. The no-button design is a nightmare for dragging and dropping with CAD applications. It had to be replaced with a wired HP mouse. The keyboard is nice and small, but after a few weeks it started to repeat keys. I contacted, and spent a considerable time with, HP support on this issue. After the support session it improved; but after several days the key repetitions came back. So I finally replaced the keyboard with a Logitech mechanical keyboard and I am happy with it. So now the machine is a dream! I am an old school computer user and enjoy the tactile feedback of the mechanical keyboard. The fan is certainly a bit noisy; but it only turns on from time to time, so it is not a concern to me. The sound is truly better than other all in ones; but, if like me you take music seriously, get a set of external loudspeakers.",4
156092,I am just starting to use it and will get back later It is easy to adjust to fit comfortably to my head and change lens.The variety of lens fits my needs perfect,4
141855,I've used it once and overall think it's fine. I like that it's stretchy material so I can pull it up over my son's car seat. I wish it had a strap in the front so I can pull it down and block the sun from coming down through the front. I'm sure I'll find a way of using it that works for us and I like it well enough so far. I like that it's bendy material as well so I can fold and store it away.,4
122375,"The color looks natural and has covered the few grays at my temple better and longer than any color I have tried so far. I have had compliments on it's color and the conditioner leaves it feeling like silk. Easy to apply, even for an amateur like me. No burning or horrible smell. I have paid a lot more for not as satisfactory results.",4
133883,"I really like these but the wires are silver, not gold, as in the photo here.",4
127594,Good magnet to hide on things or under in my garage.,4
126621,Was smaller than I expected I guess I read the description wrong but it’s not to bad. Does the job and comes in very handy,4
144505,Works great plug and play,4
125721,Works good for drinks an a trip or for work. I would buy again. Shipping was good.,4
122609,Not enough disply ports,4
134098,"Beautiful and works well, just add extra oil so you can smell it better. Doesn’t put out a lot of mist that’s one problem, but other than that it’s a good product.",4
149259,Very cute! A little smaller than I pictured but looks good in my therapy office.,4
149662,So much cooler than I expected.,4
136793,This was a good book. It kept your interest until the end. You were never sure what was going to happen next.,4
122380,"This is a good product but if it had adjustable straps beneath the ears, as shown in the picture, it would be more comfortable. Even so, this helmet will do the job.",4
153337,"I have used this adapter cable on both Windows 7 and Windows 10 and it works fine under both systems. Windows picked up the device on both systems, I did not need to use the included CD to load the drivers. The build quality of the cable seems good and the plastic used for the connectors is solid. My only problem with this adapter is the COM port number change each time to attach the USB port to the PC. The serial plugs have little numbered labels on them, but those don't help since the COM port numbers seem to be assigned randomly to each connector. I don't find it a hard problem to work around. I just run puTTY on each port to see which ones are talking. This works fine for my purposes, but it would be nice if the COM ports were consistent.",4
152373,Talk about drama these people In say the men stayed on that good bull shot it was refreshing to read a different story line e for one great writing read fans the drama was real!,4
145745,My husband loves it!! It keeps the tobacco moist and flavorful.,4
131246,The red looks more pinkish/maroon than pictured.,4
147295,Love this but totally disappointed it did not come with the bottoms. Had I caught that when I ordered I would have passed.,4
154390,Pretty good. I dislike the felt material because it feels rough. But it fits perfectly,4
129838,"The product performed as advertised, shielding me from a lot of unwanted glare.",4
152040,"It's sticky even after wiping with alcohol. Three days after two cures, it still feels soft. I'm new to gels, but I just didn't like it. UPDATE: Joyce from customer service reached out to me and was wonderful!! I exchanged for a couple of colors, which I really like. Like I said before, I'm new to gels so I used this top coat with the Modelones color and it works well! I will try more colors in this line.",4
139171,Purchased these to wear when I mow. These things work great to keep the dust and debris out of your nose and mouth.,4
123624,I haven't had a chance to use it yet. But the remote frequency seems to be common because it fires off every once in a while. There is no way to turn off the remote receiver at the winch.,4
136423,"The fit around the head was perfect except for the face cover (over the nose) that was too tight for me. Fairly warm on very cold days with enough clearance around head for another wool cap. Also with the face mask, spectacles cloud up on very cold days--have to remove spectacles. Plastic clip between ear flaps broke in about 2 months on very cold day.",4
137577,"I read the reviews before buying this rug and noted the inconsistency in vibrancy. Some folks said the rug was more saturated than the pictures, while a few said they were disappointed by how dull the colors were. My rug arrived today and after rolling it out, I also thought it was on the dull side. But overall I liked it. The funny thing is that when I came back to the living room later in the day, the colors looked much more saturated. I thought maybe it was the difference in lighting - natural vs LED. But, after walking around the rug, I saw that the colors look different from different angles and depending on how the threads are angled. I’m attaching three photos: 1) saturated side 2) less saturated 3) less saturated after I dragged my feet across the rug in a couple areas. I’m guessing it will be more consistent if I vacuum over it? Outside of that interesting issue, it looks exactly as expected :)",4
158064,My daughter loves these socks. She did not want to take the off after trying them on. fit perfect and very light weight also.,4
151435,I purchased the hats for my annual girlfriend Christmas fellowship. my biggest worry was if the hats would fit everyone and they did. Would have liked them to be a little plusher but other than that they were great!,4
159437,I used them to make coasters. Although they are really thin* I loved the final result. *I used two pieces per coaster.,4
121005,The hair out of the pack is very soft & silky. Hair has a slight smell to it (hopefully it will wash out). The bundle are very thin. Im going to buy a scale because there is no way these bundles are 100 grams. I will be updating after wash then another after install! Update: I was able to wear this hair from mid July to early September. The photos show the hair from initial install to last week on use in order. Hair comes back to life after each wash but starts to get more and more tangles. The hair sheds like crazy the hair wasn't as full as I like but was well worth the price. I will buy again,4
149098,Very nice. My wife was happy so I'm happy. We would not hesitate to purchase again.,4
137883,"I bought these pegs for a peg board that came with a work bench from Harbor Freight. The work bench itself is not the highest quality, and I was worried that the pegs wouldn’t fit correctly. I received the pegs and to my relief they fit. They do take some wiggling and force to get them into the pegboard, but they work perfectly. They are durable and sturdy enough that they hold all the tools that I have mounted with them, but pliable enough that it is possible to get them into peg boards that aren’t the highest quality. These hooks will probably outlast the work bench itself.",4
127290,I like this eye cover very comfortable. I use it every morning as day light gets through the windows. In the warm days it feels very warm and sweaty on my face as it covers almost half my face. The rubber band strap is already pretty loose and I got it not very long ago.,4
129034,"Much thinner than I expected, no as large either, but it pretty",4
141599,Overall good looking costume. The neck was exposed and it pills A TON. Sent seller message and got a quick response and the request was granted.,4
129081,did not receive on scheduled ship date.,4
135404,I love the soft feel and look of it although it isn't the best quality it has held up alright. The case broke in one corner but it's too cute to take off,4
145174,a little thin still a nice,4
151865,Woof woof. Works great And better quality than. Pedi paws.,4
126928,"There’s a little bit of play in the finished product, so be prepared to reset the hammock a few times. Very sturdy, though.",4
133690,"This is an excellent product. I’d consider it an almost essential when camping. Boils water in minutes. Can cook on it as well. My only complaint is the weight. It’s a lot heavier than I expected. I was expecting it on the day it arrived. When I saw a package on my porch, I picked it up and didn’t know what it was because it was much heavier than I expected. Not sure how much lighter the titanium version is but it may be worth saving up for. My pack is heavy enough without adding more weight than necessary. Remember. Everything adds up. Ounces = pounds, and pounds = pain. Keep plenty of twigs handy to get it going. And keep plenty of sticks handy once it’s lit. It does burn through sticks quickly.",4
135990,A little bit heavy but will take the abuse bought to replace an earlier version that finally wore out after 30 years,4
138059,"Exactly what I was looking for, nice lightweight that doesn't get too hot in the summer, very soft fabric",4
130762,I normally hate insta love but i quickly got over it the female character is like me i identify with Meryn so easily. The book had its funny silly moments slice of drama and bam a cliffhanger and a secret vamp vamp how old are you?,4
130852,"It fit my cat’s neck fine, but I couldn’t use it because her litter box is in a cat house. The entrance isn’t large enough for her to fit in with the cone.",4
136552,Great product. Burn clean and proper.,4
151940,Work great and fits well.,4
153334,"For those who like all the loose ends tied, very satisfactory. Just no startling surprises. You can enjoy in just one sitting.",4
137978,The hair is not human hair but it looks good for the price,4
124045,"Love the style, the fit is one of the most comfortable I've had in a long time although a couple pair do seem a little on the small side.",4
130047,Fine product and the fact that it comes individual packets is useful,4
157930,"These are really in a separate category when it comes to nutritional bars. Great quality, just wished they tasted better.",4
142227,"As many have noted, seems to be well made, and the actual product seems to perfectly match the pictures with the listing. Came with a tool to remove the old band, and new spring bars for the new one. Only gave four stars instead of five due to the initial stiffness. I actually opted to wear it with the band one notch tighter than needed for a couple of evenings, which seems to have broken it in. Now fits perfectly.",4
142429,Longer words would make it better. I get bored after 15 minutes as the same words pop up frequently.,4
159303,Great fit and perfect for work and after work events. True to size and color!,4
134515,With all the weight I've gained I'm always surprised when something is too large. I really dislike returning anything so I'll just wear it under my poncho. The fabric is exactly as I expected so not disappointed in anything but the fit.,4
121242,Just a touch wider than I had hoped. I am 5.5 and weigh about 140. The medium is a bit to wide at the bottom but a good longer length. It fits nice through the busy and shoulders.,4
134773,"Great swing very durable, wish the chains were longer and came with springs and a hanging kit as I know all of the material used to build this swing might have been about 40 bucks..",4
142853,Works well but the rubber stoppers that go on the toilet seat fall off very easy and the water stream comes out of the gap between the bowl and seat.,4
128013,it's good but not loud.,4
133456,Exactly what my hubby needed and wanted. He is happy!,4
143889,"Bought this to replace my older Mountainsmith bag that was stolen. This one is nice size, with several compartments to store your things in. Seems to be durable and well made.",4
136300,Good quality and sound.,4
131429,I use it to organise my bag of tricks. As a semi-professional magician i have prop bag that needed some organisation. This fit the bill perfectly.,4
155093,The Montgomery series is my favorite Samantha chase series and this one did not disappoint. I also love a good second chance romance. I'd highly recommend this to everyone I know.,4
130687,Nice quality beads. Would have given 5 stars if clasps included had been a little better...nothing like making a nice necklace to have the clasp keep breaking making them unwearable.,4
142775,Good storage and pretty simple assembly. What I don’t like is the top just fits on with nothing to really secure it. I ordered another one that has a zipper top and much prefer that one.,4
155623,"The product works very well, I’m pleased. Small and compact easy to use. Only negative thing is the small print on the instructions.",4
142275,"I give it a 4 because of the sturdiness. The top is a little soft, so putting a drink on it and then another causes it to move and give. We will likely put a piece of glass on top so it doesn’t feel like your drink will fall over if someone picks up or sets down another one. Other than that, very attractive and looks nice with our Chair King set.",4
143058,"This works well, it is very easy to install. My main suggestion is don't loosen the screw too much when removing. The only things I would like is for it to swivel for uneven ground, and to be about 4 inches longer. Not big issues, but would be nice.",4
134209,"Great product, gives off lots of light we have two of these in our laundry room 11x14 ft and the light level is amazing",4
144069,"Overall, does a great job cooling a medium sized room.. It is however a little bit on the loud side, but not enough that it keeps you up at night.. It’s just white noise to me..",4
136262,Improves grip to 3 fingers instead of one!! But won't go in by back pocket.,4
138955,"Worth the money, but unfortunately most airlines rejects the purse height. Too high/tall to go on an airplane. If you're not using it to fly with your dog the bag is precious. My dog liked it. I recommend it still.",4
132671,Makes you think as to the evidence of ones faith and the necessity to be able to articulate the reason why you believe in Christ.,4
143768,Laura is the perfect heroine for my type of mystery - intelligent and realistic. She is independent and personable. The story kept my interest without the addition of a cop boyfriend or baked goods.,4
151651,Enjoyable puzzles that could be improved if incorrect letters entered were shown in a different color.,4
159146,Very compact and cheaper than other options. It works great!,4
121688,"Very nice, easy to set up. One drawer doesn't open very well though , there's is so much packaging , I filled 4 huge garbage bags of styrofoam",4
155060,"The padded straps are very comfortable, but both they and the band were somewhat short. I'll probably need to go one size up.",4
143757,Really enjoyed this sexy read by a new to me author! I thought the plot was intriguing and the main characters were perfect for the story! Roman and Quinn had such an interesting dynamic and definitely held my interest! Looking forward to reading more from K. Sterling.,4
154248,Works as described. Just what I needed for my car but battery life is terrible. Does come with USB charger so I just leave it plugged in charging while I'm using it.,4
120045,Looks to be great fun.,4
142308,"This dress is classy! There's a reason it's an Amazon pick. It's a slightly stretchy material which is great. The sleeves were slightly loose as was the dress as a whole but it fits great! It hit me right below the knee. I am 5' 3"" and 175lbs if we're being completely honest. When I measured myself before ordering I measured 41"" bust 36"" wasit 45"" hips. I ordered a xxl. This is the dress I decided to keep out of three that I ordered. You could wear it to church as the v neck isn't too low very modest but it's great for a wedding it any dress occasion.",4
141837,Good product for the money.,4
129001,Great buy! The plastic is hard to take off. Kind of wish they used foam instead to protect it. I still have plastic on the bottom of it and it will not come off.,4
130772,"Everything in one place now - not carrying multiple units for different items. It is a bit heavy, but not anymore than the 3 things that it replaces.",4
130275,They are cute for work.,4
126914,"I know this seems counter-intuitive since this isn't an antiperspirant, but this natural deodorant has completely cleared up my hyperhidrosis. Perhaps I've been reacting poorly to the chemicals in the traditional deodorants I've been using? In any case, I really love the feel and smell of this product and I'm glad it's natural and isn't tested on animals. Plus, it doesn't mark up or stain my clothes! My only wish is that the sticks contained more product or lasted longer. All around, highly recommended.",4

121644,"I agree with many reviewers that this book is a recycled version of the first one. Plus, it's hard to explain time-travel to a 4-year-old. I much prefer the original story. However, my kids (ages 2 and 4) LOVE this book. They will pick it over the first one almost every time. They think the diapers and the ""tacos love dragons"" pages are hilarious. They also love the last page, although the pictures include multiple cultural references that they don't understand. So, who am I to question a book that my kids love so much?",4
131330,"Great oil. Just what I needed, although, the packaging left a lot to be desired. I had oil spillage everywhere when it was delivered. The company needs to wrap it better.",4
149798,"As expected. Not much protection with this minimal case. I would say it's not the best choice for a $950 phone. But if that's what you want, go for it. Fits well. Get what you pay for.",4
143498,Very soft and comfortable.,4

135435,I love all her books and try to read every one. They are always a great read.,4
150319,"I read reviews that I should size down and regret doing this. They fit, but just so-- I would have much more velcro to work with if I bought my true size. I didn't consider wearing my Apple Watch while working out and the velcro straps do effect this. The strap has pushed the button and turned off my watch mid-workout. VERY frustrating. I am working on a solution and trying to make it work!",4
122869,4 stars because it looks more like yellow than gold,4

149802,"It was a very fun and easy build, took about a half hour. I am 6'2 and I fit perfectly; the back and head support go a real long way. I have been able to stay comfortable for hours of gaming. Only draw back I have had is the arms are needing to be tightened constantly.",4
123185,Good quality for the price.,4
121459,"Instructions are very thorough, and it comes with 2 of everything needed (which is rare). Application was very easy and honestly one of the best feeling protectors I've ever used. Feels like I'm using the actual screen. Only issue is keeping dust from sticking to the adhesive side of the protector before you can get it applied. Hard as I tried (removed, cleaned and reapplied 3 times), I couldn't get a 100% dust free application. However, it is bubble free adhesion like the listing states.",4
120363,"When hitting the volume up/down button you can feel the give in the case and you can feel yourself hitting the buttons, but not on the power button. It feels hard and I can't tell if I am actually hitting the button or not. Case is really nice though. Very slick.",4
155208,"Looks good. Just not as durable as I thought. My brother seems to like it. Wasn't very expensive, so satisfied.",4
158159,"Not rigid like you’d expect, but thoroughly adequate . Fully loaded, it sags just barely.",4
133950,"I like this product and it holds a lite AR15 on the wall just fine, however my other gun seemed too heavy for the mount as it seemed to sag and droop a bit due to its heavy barrel. Also this is not designed to really work on a wall with lath and plaster or stucco!",4
141157,It was exactly as I expected it to be. It’s perfect for my kpop photocards.,4
159292,"I love this. But I can’t use it, and here are the reasons: PROS: -Color true to the picture. -Arrived on time with no scratches. -Closes perfectly (not loose like some flimsy stuff). CONS: -the bag part is veryyyy small and would only hold a phone . It should be called a belt with storage but definitely NOT a bag of any sort. So, I was going to wear this on my trip to the beach but it didn’t fit anything and I had to carry my big bag to be able to hold some cards.... I still loveit and wear it as a belt = )",4

It will deteriorate faster if you leave it in the sun, we store under roof. Good quality. Not a kids toy as the mesh can be ripped, but this is mine and I take care of it.",4

146196,"I just want to say don’t buy this case if you’re not delicate with cases which is odd coming from a lifeproof review but hear me out, the water testing passed flawlessly, the sound was great, but whenever I called someone they said they could barely hear me even when I had the port open for chargeing port, that piece broke off within days as well. So overall I wouldn’t recommend buying this case if you treat your phone like a piece of wood in winter. I gave it 4 stars just because of everything else",4

It comes in a rather small pot, so I placed it in an attractive taller planter, sat it on something to raise it up and covered the top of the pot with dry moss. That gave me the height I wanted.

This is by no means a masterpiece but it brings a lot of reading enjoyment.",4
124223,"This was an exciting read. My only complaint was the reluctance to address race. I am still not sure if Peter is white or black. It took awhile to acknowledge the color of other characters.I just found that disconcerting. I mean the dog's appearance was loud and clear. I don't care but like to ""know"" the hero.",4

132754,"I did a lot of research on this style. I wanted one that wasn't as bulky as mine, but still had plenty of room to carry enough for 2 kids plus my essentials. I love that it has an extra compartment in the front. Most that I looked at didn't have this. I also really like that you can access the inside from a zipper in the back and has the extra cell phone compartment. (I actually use it for my wallet.) I'm not super impressed with the insulated pockets, though. My kids' milk cups barely fit in them, and it's very hard to zip once they are. The insulation part has also come loose and slides down. Other than that, my only complaint is that I wish the inside liner was a darker color. I already have a stain from my sister's drink spilling into it which isn't a big deal, it would have just not been as noticeable if it wasn't so light. All in all, very pleased with my purchase especially for the price!",4

I like the days past and to come feature, as that also helps with my job. I like the holidays and moon listings. Not a fan of the lack of white space. Last year's calendar had the month name inside the white space and that allowed me to write special reminders of upcoming events. This one doesn't have that small amount of white space so noting advance events is trickier. With that bar of white space, this would have been a 5 star review.",4

All recipes are saved with simple ingredients and easy cooking directions. I found this book very informative and useful. It is well written and good organized.

And what a good thing I was ordering it for myself, rather than as a Christmas gift, since it arrived with crushed corners and there would not likely be time to return it and take a risk on another one.",3
85212,"Where to start ?:... it took about a month to ship, which really sucked. Once it arrived the package was very flimsy and not very protective also not discreet at all!!! It said TOY in all caps right on the package . The instructions were in Chinese but it did have separate ones In English but very small print ! So small I had to use a magnifying glass just to read them. Works how advertised but I couldn’t get the remote (which was bigger than I expected) to work until I charged everything fully for a few hours, i does have an indicator light and flashes while charging , I had to sorta plug the dc cable in just right and move it around so that I could make full contact in order for it the charge ( took me about a day to get this thing fully charged ) . Very soft and smooth texture , The head swivels in a circular motion which I didn’t even know it did, but not to be too graphic it just isn’t strong enough to do that while it’s in use , not a very powerful vibration either but it is quiet . It was an ok buy .",3

83499,I have read all the wonderful books in this family but I'm sad to say that this one was just good not great. What happened to dialogue between the couple - most of the relationship was in their thoughts not in what they said. What happened to bringing in the family members and the fun of their dialogue. What happened to make the heroine such a whiner - the constant I'm not good enough. Not to mention the contradictions on what's said in ome chapter such as the great mother that leaves her son alone overnight by himself while shes on a date. The Male characters had the alpha attitude these books are known for and that saves the book.,3

106526,It definitely transfers files at a very fast speed for 3.0. And it is definitely capable of fast charging. However it is constantly dinging and connecting and disconnecting every other second if it's ever touched while in use. I have to sit my phone down still on a countertop or something and not hold it in my hand. If I'm trying to transfer a file I need to do that also and just touch the screen gently to not move it or it will completely disconnect and try and reconnect which would ruin any file transfers and progress and will mess up the charging as well.

I relaxed my muscles as the removal instructions told me when i tried standing up, but even though I could feel the rim it was like it kept slipping out of my reach every time I tried to grip it! This panicked me because I was in public and couldn't just lay on the stall floor to fish it out. Also, the cup seemed to disappear up there the first few days (my cervix height changed which is normal but made the whole removal time a pain).

The spout instead of a straw was also a major plus for easy cleaning. Unfortunately, this product had a nauseating odor when we got it. I ordered two and both had such a strong smell that it took countless washing, air drying and soaking in vinegar and soap for me to even consider putting a beverage in it. Several weeks later it finally seemed to dissipate and is now being used regularly without any problems. This little bottle would be absolutely perfect had it not been for the chemical odor.

108360,"This was unwittingly the first ""reverse harem"" book I picked up out of sheer boredom (I'm pretty sure because there was an ad with a horse on it), and said, ""Eh, what the heck, I'll give it try."" I was pleasantly surprised that the plot was not half bad, and the characters were even interesting in their own right. Personally, the polyamory was a bit uncomfortable to read for me. I was hoping the main character would just choose one, the wolf-shifter preferably! I have not pursued the rest of the series, despite the compelling plot and characters. If these sort of relationships do not rub you the wrong way, it's not a bad read!",3

I turned it inside out and washed it by hand in a tub of soapy water, and that helped some. But, it has a very weird, very strong odor and anything you put in the pouch will likely soon smell that way also. Otherwise it was really inexpensive, so, there it is. You get what you pay for. It is made alright and advertised appropriately.",3
103875,"I exercise 2 hours a day: 1 hour of jogging or walking and 1 hour in the gym. I own different types of slimming belts to help me sweat even if I used it for only 1 hour, I sweat. But this shaper did not let me sweat at all for one hour of lifting weights at the gym. I usually sweat profusely but this did not give me any as far as I can see. Very disappointed and it fits loose on the back for a small shaper. I will keep it though for jogging in the summer when I want to have loose fitting shaper. I wish they made extra small size for someone like me. I've never been disappointed in slimming products except for this one. However, it is comfortable if you don't want anything that is tight and it is a nice thin material. It also gives me a little bit of breast lift. So I concluded that I will use adjustable material for my waist so that it will fit right. This shirt is not adjustable.",3
86040,"I’ve had this case for a couple months now. It fits perfectly and it looks great on my phone. I’ve dropped it a couple of times and it’s held pretty good. I did get a crack in my screen protector with my recent drop. One thing that bugs me is it says it’s scratch proof, but it’s not. After having it for a month or two I had scratches all over it. Now it’s all over. I bought it for the fact that it was scratch proof, so I was pretty upset to find out that the description was false.",3

I left it on the charger over night and it never lit up so I'm not sure if it's broken or what but it's pretty disappointing. I'd return it but I really don't want to go through the hassle. EDIT**** I am adding a star based off of how good and responsive their Customer Service Team was. My charger ended up not working and they immediately emailed me and offered different solutions to see if my charger would work using various different methods. Ultimately none worked so they offered a replacement but I was actually leaving for vacation so they gave me a full refund.

85367,No instructions were included in the box so when it came to filling the water gun with water it was confusing where to pull up the cover or unscrew it. You need to unscrew it. Once that was taken care of they were fine for the first day. On the second use one doesn’t hold pressure and one does.,3

Now I know why some other fitness shirts cost more and it's because they are odorless. I don't normally write reviews but was compelled only because I want other Amazon buyers to know. Like I said, the shirt looks nice, fits well and does keep me cool and dry, but the smell is going to drive me to buy other brands.",3

I had both a (maybe bootleg) pdf and the rented hardbound text, and I found myself using the hardbound textbook most of the time. This textbook is definitely worth no more than the rental price. Let’s be honest, though, you will be learning most of the material from your professor and Khan Academy. Like Mr. T said, I pity the fool that has to teach himself statistics with a textbook.

Definitely waterproof and does last a long time. this tube would probably last forever as it only takes a very small amount.

That is how thin it is.",3

His eyebrows are salt and pepper at this point and we'd like them darker. My hair/eyelashes are brunette but the ends of my lashes are blonde. I tried this on myself first three times. Although it seemed to dye my lashes a little bit, I couldn't see a significant difference. The texture of the product is odd; the mixture doesn't actually mix well together which may cause problems. I tried it on my father. It's not as good as using regular hair dye on his brows but the fact that we can use this multiple times makes this more economical. We leave it on him for 15-20 minutes and I really have to COAT it on his brows. Once we wash it off, they are darker but not as dark as with hair dye. Using regular hair dye was much easier to do on his eyebrows but paying for an entire box just for brows wasn't worth it. I'm going to use the rest of this product but I doubt I'll buy it again.",3

85803,I do love it but it could have been just a little bigger around. I’m a small woman so it wasn’t too bad but the bottom of my jacket does get wet and if the wind blows only the part under the dome stays dry. But I love that it goes over my face I just wish it was a little bigger around.,3

The two side areas, while also not having any lip to constrain items to the rear, can at least hold a chapstick without it falling out for almost a complete jeep trail.

102033,Very comfortable. Too bad they fall apart so quickly. Uppers cracked and peeled even when polished and conditioned. Lasted maybe 4 months. Soles were still perfectly fine.,3
82518,It is very hard. Can't really be used for dodge ball. Works well as a basketball though.,3
108533,"Arrived and it was sooooo long. I figured it would shrink in the wash but it shrunk by over a foot! I am now wearing as capris. Still comfortable but I ordered them for the winter, not summer months.",3
98823,Love these bags but they didn’t come with any twist ties or any other way to close them. I don’t think I’ve ever bought treat bags that didn’t come with at least a basic twist tie. I ended up having to buy additional items to seal the bags. FYI it’s very hard to find twist ties alone to purchase in stores!,3
83197,"It's not as textured as I expected, it's also lighter than I expected (expresso brown). It also feels flimsy and is pretty small.",3
113494,"Ordered Black with Pink trim, received an all denim harness. Retuned and re-ordered a black with pink trim, received a denim with pink trim! Not black as ordered but not going to bother with another return and receive the wrong harness again!!",3
108504,Not sure that they really made any kind of a difference. My plants still ended up dying...,3
96122,It's came in good condition the Box was packaged Vine it just took several days to charge it and have to reset it several times for it to connect to my app,3
106315,Nicely made but a bit too small.,3
102443,"The top was guaranteed to not roll down, but this rolls down on me.",3
87178,it tastes very good. but it's too similar to frosting and not very slippery.,3
98646,It didn't hold onto the plug so I had to use a magnet and it wasn't long enough to reach a couple of the plugs that were deep in the heads but works well just takes some rigging,3
82561,"These are too small. I wanted somewhat tight for assurances, but these were just too small. I even sized up - I wear a 16 on bottom but ordered xxl. The leg holes are too tight. Overnight MIGHT be okay but I cant walk in them. Disappointed.",3
84880,"I could shove in 8 passports, but I couldn't comfortably close the wallet with so much bulk inside. If you don't actually need to keep 8 passports regularly, this could be useful. I returned mine since I need to carry 7 passports while travelling, and this isn't cutting it.",3
107676,"It works, but dries very slowly. Also, it’s got a strong odor. I use this for fine detail gluing, so I’m right on top of it. I then saw the warning on the tube that it can be cancer-causing. Great. Probably won’t use this anymore for up close projects. Was just getting tacky after sitting for about 10 minutes, so not ideal for quick hard gluing.",3
119216,These are not compression but they are a decent top. They are not long and sit just on hips.,3
