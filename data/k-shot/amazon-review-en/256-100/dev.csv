170837,"This cord is quite thin but silky and has nice body, no kinks or curls when taken off the roll, just ready to go, and just so nice to work with. Thin enough to thread thru larger beads, great for making sliding knot necklaces for pendants.",5
174385,"I use this laptop stand with my 15"" MacBook Pro. The gripping material allows my laptop to sit on the stand without any movement and equally as important, secures the stand to the surface you are working on. All around, the materials used for this laptop stand are of high quality. The mechanism used for folding out the stand is very sturdy and does not change position unless that is your intention. I have used laptop stands that change position if you so much as nudge them. That's not the case with the Nulaxy. I opted for the grey version and the product is aesthetically pleasing. It has a minimalist design without sacrificing any functionality. The folding function coupled with the lightweight design, allow me to pack it right in my bag when traveling. It's perfect for flying and setting up a workstation in your hotel room.",5

165197,I love love LOVE this mat. I've Never had a mat as great as this. It doesn't slide around at all while I am stretching or doing planks. Every other brand of mat I have ever tried has. Would recommend to my friends and I may buy another for my kids.,5
193088,Really great! So much better than the ones at Walmart! Will definitely buy again.,5

181355,"I have been using this keyboard for about 2 months and so far so good. Nice feel to the keys. I was worried that it would need frequent recharging but so far it has not needed it all and I use it several hours a day. I use it with an Apple laptop with two monitors. No problem synching it. The only feature that it doesn't have that might be nice is backlighting if you want to use it at night, but then that would definitely drain the battery faster.",5
161332,THIS BOOK MAKES READING FUN!!!,5
199435,Excellent Product I purchased this for my friend who has to monitor his blood pressure often due to a heart problem. He travels a lot so the light weight monitor is perfect He loves it and he get his pressure reading reports to accurately compare. Thank you for such an excellent product.,5
188005,"I ordered 2 of these watches, one for me and the other for my spouse and was super scared whether it was a good idea,, but....it WAS. I really liked them, much higher than my expectations. The watch connected to the android app very smoothly, and functions well. The strap is pretty comfortable too. Looks stylish. This is a must buy if you cannot afford the expensive branded one. Honestly, it serves the purpose if you are not brand conscious like me and are only interested in getting the deed done.",5

175206,"I am not a Ryobi fan, but their cordless glue gun is amazing for template work. We have quite a few Milwaukee (Yes, same parent company as Ryobi) batteries and decided to give this a shot instead of purchasing another battery and charging system to carry around. It snaps together like it has always been a part of it, the Milwaukee battery allows us to keep using the batteries we have. The trade off is that it is a bit bulky with the added adapter/battery combo but worth it for me.",5
194210,Got it for my 8 year old nephew. He built it with no issues. He loves Pokémon so he enjoyed it.,5
176393,A little flimsy. Would like the backing to be more stiff. But works ok.,5
188991,These decorations are easy to setup from the box. They included several stickers to choose from. The colors are vibrant and both the tins and the plants are constructed well. The white stones don't look like enough at first but end up being plenty between the 3 plants. Once assembled these look quite real! Very pleased with my purchase!,5
199535,"Nice cheap rechargeable headlamps. Even if they last only a month, it’s still a lot cheaper (and same quality) than the battery operated ones. Would buy again.",5
197723,"I own a pet sitting business and I deal with a lot of dogs with bad breath. Not only that, I also see animals who deal with gum disease and whose parents have to pay to have their teeth removed. This is very easy to use; if you have a small dog like mine you don't need much at all, so two of these will last long. (Give the extra one to a friend!) People forget dogs need dental care just as much as their human companions.",5
174655,Great purchase. Nice and sturdy!,5
181601,"fast, you adapt very fast to them, it is equal or even better than one with cables",5

169460,This cup is really nice and it keeps things cold for a long time!!! Ice even stays for a whole day!,5
164246,"Arrived without a scratch though the box was beat up. Will see how it lasts but this is indoors so I don't expect much deterioration with time. Picture instructions were easy to follow. Two 11/16 socket drivers make it easier (the included wrenches are pretty thin metal and one was squished and useless anyway). Only hint I would give is to not tighten anything until you've put those 4 bottom nuts on: to do so the easy way is to make sure the bolt spins freely (wiggle the wood parts around) and hold the nut from underneath i.e., don't turn the nut, turn the bolt until the nut is on. It's a bit of a pain to try to get the nut to turn when reaching underneath. All the holes lined up perfectly and I was swinging in my hammock in less than a half hour.",5
195941,I take this me everywhere! It’s so nice not to have to waste all those plastic water bottles! They include a sponge and straw cleaner with your purchase. I get compliments and people ask where I bought it. I love it!,5

164978,Great cleaner We have used it cleaning almost everything Even power washed the house with it,5
185852,Great tool. I use it in my teaching maintenance technicians.,5
188559,Made me cry a few times.,5
162306,"This is a great item. I use it with a weight rack for my home gym, and it's incredible how easy it moves around 300lbs. I suggest using a youtube video titled ""HTC 2000 Mobile Base Assembly"", which makes the installation process a breeze. Without the video, it would take about twice as long. You'll thank me later.",5
192679,My grandson is here visiting and loves this !,5
174746,"Great bikini! I am 5’6, 130lbs and a small fits just great. Cant wait for summer!",5
196243,"This is a great package with lots of cool colors. It’s a little thicker than the cricut brand (that’s a good thing, but adjust your cut accordingly). It weeds easily and adheres completely. The shirts I’ve done have not seen any pulling up through several washes. I’ll definitely buy more, it’s a great value!",5
169675,I use this APP quite often. It is an easy shortcut to get to my books. I do this multiple times per day.,5

166681,Gift for 4 year old... she loves them and wears them every day!,5
195248,"I received the scale quickly and loved it at first sight. It is very classy looking, especially as compared to my thick old scale. The readings are in both kg and lbs and your weight shows as soon as you step on it. There’s no getting on and off before it responds like my old scale required. Because of the glass top, it is easy to clean and because of its thinness, it easy to store under a cabinet. What I really like is that it shows small differences in your weight which can be encouraging or motivating as the case may be. It’s big enough for all the different size feet in my family. Chances are, I'll have to buy another one for the kids' bathroom, but that's not a problem at this price. The battery looks like it is easy to change and inexpensive to change when needed.",5
181646,"Solid item, pretty much OEM!",5
184368,Unboxed router and hooked up. Very simple and works like it is supposed to work. Very happy with purchase.,5
191866,Great product to entertain the little ones. We bought the 5 pack based on some of the reviews about quality. They all work and are in great condition! I'm really glad that we bought 5 because 5 is just better then 2!,5

178598,Love love. Great for both limes and lemons.,5
168695,"This is a really good option for a physical sunscreen because it has high, broad spectrum protection, and the white cast is not awful. In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen. I have sensitive skin, but I've had no negative reaction to the product whatsoever! I'm very satisfied with this purchase and look forward to repurchasing it in the future.",5
192740,Perfect for my wiring job.,5
194118,"if i could afford it i'd treat these like daily vitamins and drink one every day. they're wonderful pick-me-ups after a rough night, and they don't taste bad (go away pepto, you suck). i'm prone to terrible hangovers and these make me feel like a human being again.",5
165820,I like this product because I can adjust the lighting on bulb. The switch makes it easy to set this. Its very quick to melt your wax and gives off scents quick! Would recommend for a small space though.,5
181140,This gives a great boost of flavor to fish-based or miso soups. I really love it.,5
191267,"I love the colors, the design and the texture of this. Really great product.",5
166108,"I bought these hoping they would fit a whirlpool refrigerator and they do. If I ever need a bulb again, which I don't think I'll need, these will do the trick.",5

174266,Bought these for the grandkids’ stocking stuffers for Christmas 2018. Ages 8 and 10. It’s now October 2019 and my grandson still plays with his. Kids love these things.,5

160972,"These ski straps are working really well so far and they feel durable and look pretty good too. Even though I’ve used ski straps before, most didn’t have a section to carry my skis and were too small to fit both skis and poles. The thing I like about this one is that it has a section for the skis and another section for the poles. All in all pretty pleased with this!",5
170016,Nicely made. Fits Great,5
170201,I have this in my hall bath that both my children and I use. I use this for the waterpik system. It keeps it off the counter but easily accessible. Would be great in a small bedroom for a phone stand by the bed.,5

163356,I was really pleased with this product. It took a little while to blow up but we used an air compressor. The part that goes over the slide tends to fall over if it is windy but it is no big deal. The product is reflective of the pictures. I would recommend this for young children.,5
161580,This bible is great.,5
178819,"The great thing about this is the POE power supply directly from the DVR saving you a ton of work. You only have to mount the cameras and run the wires (supplied) plug them up and start your settings. I can view my 4 home cameras from ANYWHERE on my cell phone or lap top! It is so cool to be sitting in a restaurant and show a friend a view of your home on your cell phone. The DVR setup is a pain but the cell phone setup is SO easy!! You just scan the bar code symbol and poof, like magic you can see all of your cameras. I give the total package a 9 out of 10. I DO recommend this system.",5
193451,"These are super comfortable and I bought a second pair. They are one size fits most. I'm 5'2"" and 112 pounds for reference. I would guess they would fit up to a 10/12 or larger.",5

187250,I want sure what to expect from this product. I recently took a trip across the US and it definitely made my ride more enjoyable.

187936,"I had a Moto G4 plus and checked out the specs on the G5 plus. The 2.0 ghz was a real improvement. I went with the 64gb and 4gb ram plus the 128gb micro sd. The octa core configuration makes this phone a real power miser. When traveling I preload my entertainment on the phone (60 hours worth using up 60gb on the chip). Not using wifi helps with security. I went from 16 to 12gb on the camera, but the programing and focus seems to be better. Low light is excellent. The battery is a permanent. On fast charge there does not seem to be a lot of heat.",5
187602,Came right on time! Exactly what I needed!,5
194732,"Having a relationship with a narcissists is not something any one should be happy about because its quite a tough situation for anyone involved on such a relationship.

168730,"Mava Sports Knee Braces are made of high quality material that gave my knees a good feel of compression. It is important to measure your leg to get the correct size. The braces came in nice, easy to open packaging. I found the Velcro straps to be a little shorter than I would like them. However, that did not effect their performance. I trail walk 6 miles a day and find them comfortable enough to forget I am wearing them.",5
162522,Perfect transaction. The door is very well made and a perfect match for a gnome I already have. Very happy with this purchase.,5
187398,"Our 40+ year old door bell finally bought the farm, so we got this Honeywell. So far we love it! It has quite a few different sounds pre-loaded but you can add new sounds and it is so simply to do! You just connect it to your computer with the included USB cable... and a window for the doorbell open and you can drag and drop the mp3 file into the window and your done. No fancy complicated program...just drag and drop. It also has volume buttons and mute/timer buttons. One thing I really like is that since it isn't hardwired into your house, you can set the doorbell anywhere you want. I did go ahead and hang it on the wall where my old one was but it is very easy to lift it off the hanger so I can take it to my computer(and add new sounds).",5

A few people have asked me if the are an expensive designer brand, which was not my intention at all, but I’m happy to inform them where I got them for just a fraction of the cost.

192532,"Happy with them so far, wasn’t a huge fan of the straps that were included on my shipment, although they worked I scratched and dented my roof of my car already from the metal hooks, so I ordered additional non scratch straps that were easier to use and won’t cause any damage",5

179089,This works for a great deep clean. It hurts a bit to pull it off because it does pull on fine hair but my face feels so smooth after.,5
192079,the customer service was the best customer service I have ever received. I reached out to them for a problem and they were always so quick to reply and with good resolutions.,5
187100,Connected with no problem and the gauge works well. Would recommend.,5
161393,Love this dish rack! It is so easy to fold and unfold. It's sturdy and the perfect size. Big enough to fit some items but not so big that it takes up all the space on the counter. Use it everyday and still in good condition. Is slim when folded and put away.,5

176108,"Love my bottle. Has kept me on top of my hydration and makes it seem effortless. Only thing I don’t is that the spout and the times do not line up. So it takes just a little more effort to flip it around to make sure I’m on track. I hope that makes sense, kinda difficult to word it out. I basically would like the spout to be facing the same side as the times so that after I drink I could set it down and see where I stand, instead of having to turn it around.",5

11975,This product is shit!!!!! Do not buy or waste your time. I bought one and it arrived severely damaged. I returned that one and got another one.. also severely damaged. The product is flimsy and not worth the money. Very dissapointed and was really looking forward to having this. The company owes me big.. do not buy this product or any product. I had to select a star to have this review go through. It is the only reason otherwise I would have selected none.,1

And a few days later saw oil pooling under my truck. So off they came again and I RTV'd them onto the covers and put 'em back on the other day. I am kicking myself, shoulda just bought the cheap squishy FelPro ones and been good for another 10 years. The material is not soft, barely left an impression on the gasket, so I don't see how these would really seal all that well on the rougher cast iron edge of the head. Maybe they work better on machined surfaces and smooth aluminum covers, but they don't on older style engines. with sheet metal covers.

It also has weird compressed areas on it almost like an iron was pressed on it in various places. I would return it, except I washed it a few times trying to make it softer and see if the compressed areas would disappear. No such luck on either point. I have owned 3 Vellux blankets over many years and loved the light weight, softness, warmth and appearance. This has none of those qualities. It's a fairly expensive....rag? tarp? dog bed blanket?

54497,I don't know if it was just me but they were very uncomfortable on my ears that there was no way I could wear for hours for hours on end. The design was very nice and sleek along with the box but I felt it was a little complicated as well since the earbud section rotates it was a little hard at first and it's definitely a pain putting it back in the case properly.

I'm pretty sure it's the coconut flavor in the filling that is ruining the taste for me, it gives the cookie an extreme sweet finish that's just “too much” when paired with the outer fudge. I'm going to see if Oreo is making these with their regular creme filling. The good news: each little cookie is about the size of a quarter, and you get to have 9 for just 150 calories. Not sure whether even a coconut-lover would want to eat that many, but it might be nice to eat just 2 or 3 to finish a meal or satisfy an urge for a treat.",2

Packaging states not to inflate by mouth so I chose to use an electric balloon pump, I had no issues with inflating the balloons however they ended up popping very easily. Hours into our party they would randomly burst and it wasn’t due to the size of the balloons as we had issues with many of the smaller ones randomly exploding. The talcum powder used for these smelled odd compared to other brands and left a very heavy residue on hands. I also struggled with tying off the ends of the balloons and even ended up ripping some skin off my fingers due to how hard they were to knot (we use balloons often for decoration in large quantities and I’ve never had this issue before).

This door is two frame pieces, and 4 inner wall pieces that are very hard to hold in place all at once will securing the two frame pieces. This door is also wider than the average size dog door and we had to cut a wider opening to accommodate- also this door is shorter in height and there was a large gap to be filled on top and bottom. Last issue with the door which is prompting a replacement-- the rigid flap was moderately hard for my small dogs to open and after less than a year, broke in half with continued use. We came home to a door with a sharp edge that could have injured my dogs after it broke expectantly.

But it didn't take long to realize the noise level of the fan motor was much louder at the slower and faster speeds. Since the fan is installed in the bedroom the noise level isn't acceptable. Wish I could give a db rating but it is loud enough to keep anyone awake at night. Much louder than the Leviton 3 speed control I had on it. I immediately removed it and put the Leviton back on. The control does work well with the smart phone app, and with an Echo (Alexa), and relatively easy to install.

I had to click it many times before it would pass the page. I thought that the problem was due to the fact my laptop was not in a direct line of sight to where I was standing, which was only about 50 feet away, in an enclosed building and without any other obstacles. On my next attempt, we raised the laptop to where the USB receiver was clearly visible from my point of view, but had the same problem of having to click the pointer numerous times, while extending my arm in an attempt to get closer, in order to get a response from the device.

By completely failed, I mean a huge hole had formed under the right heel, straight through the inner and outer soles. My heel was literally in contact with pavement by end of July. The day these arrived, they were generally fine. The only issue I had was a slight discomfort under the right heel. It felt like an imperfection in the inner sole, but it was not enough to stop wearing them. By month 2, the discomfort under the right heel had manifested as a hole in the inner sole. By month 4, the outer sole had worn through on the same spot, and by month 5, I could easily stick two fingers through the right heel and had to stop wearing them. The shoes were otherwise generally very comfortable with the exception of THE GAPING HOLE under the right heel. I really liked the Velcro fastener and the roomy toe-box. I thought I had found a hidden gem of a product -- why would I continue to pay 3X the cost for Merrell Trail Gloves? Oh, now I see. It's because they last 6X as long.",2

So when I pull up, the handle will often extend fully before I can get the shoe horn out of my shoe. But the biggest problem is that the shoe horn and handle are attached to each other with a spring. With many shoes, I find that the shoe horn flops up when inserting my heal, making it difficult to use.

The pros are the cost, comfort, and the design is pretty cool (light is able to rotate down and up). However, this lamp eats through AAA batteries like crazy. I was changing the batteries every week. Also, the light goes dim or shuts off completely when it is very cold - below 20 F. Also, I dropped the headlamp from a distance of about four feet onto the ground and the headlamp clasp completely broke. The light also is not that bright compared to other headlamps.",2

62184,Tool constantly locks up and is very hard to get running. I have to blow it out and beat it on the edge of my work bench to get it to run. Sometimes it takes a long time to get it to run. Performs good after getting it go but gets hot quick and needs lots of breaks to keep from over heating. I guess you get what you pay for. Definitely not worth the money spent.,2
56815,"Cheap thin leather and the metal buckles and loops match in quality. On the larger size, Im using the 2nd tightest hole. For what it costs though its not worth the time or shipping to return and I guess I will wear it occasionally just not as nice as I was looking for.",2

42730,"Liked the ability to plug into the EU plug in Brazil using our US chargers. Went to a hotel and ran into an unusual situation. The outlet was US but the laptop charger we needed to plug in was the EU plug. The US prongs on the charger extend but do not lock. Never was able to get a charge. Had to get an adaptor from the hotel. Also, don't let your wife plug in her hair dryer, it blew the fuse. Just like the warning labels tell you. I gave it 2 stars because it worked as designed but failed to lock the US plug in place.",2

However, the privacy protection of this screen cover does not work very well, or as well as others that I have used. You can still see what’s on the screen from the side at several angles.

55158,"We have purchased this product at the time it first came out and it was amazing!!! However since they changed their formula to the ""new and improved"" version, it's no longer the same and it does not deliver the same results it did. Yet another great product that has gone downhill",2

61844,"Poorly written book. The author takes 100-150 pages to write an autobiography of his life. Could have been said in 1-2 pages. He's not famous so I don't know why he thinks anybody would care about his life prior in that much detail. I've never seen that before in an NDE book. I don't know if I believe his NDE. He apparently dies, gets transferred to another hospital, etc. Then after all that comes the NDE, not interwoven in the details as it allegedly happened. It's like it's an afterthought. The way the book was written you think you are buying three separate books: an autobiography, memoir of his medical emergency and then an NDE book. That the book received prior 5-star reviews (and only 5-star reviews up until this point) suggests the possibility the reviews were bought, or biased reviews from friends/family in an effort to support his work. Read other NDE books and you'll see how badly written this book is, not a 5* book by any means.",2

I thought the stickers would bother her, but she didn't even move when I put them on her feet. They seemed to keep her from slipping, so then it was just a question of how long they would last since we walk several times a day on cement and grass. My husband and I went out for an hour and left our dog at home. When we got back, the stickers had been chewed off (not eaten, luckily).",2

61337,"I got this to use in the office where I figured a manual grinder would be preferable to something that needs to be plugged in. Does an acceptable job of grinding coffee once you get it setup. Downside is the handle is too long and the thumb-screw is always working itself loose as you grind. You end up grinding for a few spins, stopping to tighten the screw, grind some more, tighten, etc etc etc. Super annoying - it needs a locking pin or something to hold it all together once you have it set where you want it. I'll probably throw some loc-tite on it and see if that helps.",2

It is not sewn like a carpet or rug. It is very cheap and thin. It is very soft though. I think for the price it is NOT worth it. It comes vacuumed sealed compressed from china, so you have no idea there is a ""rug"" in the package. It would look cute on a bed as well. It is soft and my daughter likes it.",2

151234,Ive only used a few times cuz its still pretty new to me. but i really like it. cooks food faster and healthier. even got my husband using it.,4
128943,Didn't hold my 4 year old grandson's attention as I had hoped...but that's not the seller's fault. Received on time with no problems.,4
142185,Ordered in blue. Like it very much. I wear them out.,4
141503,"This bag rolls very easily and is a good size to carry on an airplane. I was disappointed in the fact that it expands only a little bit on the bottom end. I know this is so it is still weighted right to keep it from tipping over, but I wish I had bought a bag that expanded more to hold purchases along the way. (I usually check my bag on the return because I expand it.) It seems very sturdy and well-made.",4
151733,"Nice brush, except the dog really doesn't like it",4
126868,my grandson is at university & i send him a care package w/ this & he likes it,4
120563,I purchased a small and seemed closer to the size of a medium. Otherwise very nice shirt with soft material.,4
128818,Mounted easily and does the job right! Sometimes it shakes when i Drive and i think it’s going to fall but it hasn’t yet so it’s great so far !,4
155792,"My son is obsessed and this toy brings back so many memories. I love this toy, but we've had an issue keeping his arm down. He has a karate chop action arm that just doesn't secure well enough. Very nice other than the arm. Tom's of phrases and lots of actions. Would recommend",4
132159,"Overall a super cute lunch bag! I purchased the yellow one and I love it! For the price the quality was as expected. Nothing crazy, but gets the job done. Very roomy and tall so you can fit drinks in it without any issue. If you’re looking for a decent quality cute lunch bag for a great price this is a good option.",4
154058,This jacket is great! I got a lot of compliments on it. I bought it because it looked like I could wear it somewhere nice while also looking a little like a carhart jacket for work. Overall I am very pleased!,4
131967,"Overall, this is a cheap, Chinese-made, but functional portable makeshift pull-up bar, which is a great alternative to a stationary one. Annoying that a search on Amazon doesn’t show it, as I found it indirectly. I put it in the backyard and will also use it to attach a child swing. Sturdy, but I would not recommend doing excessively vigorous activities on it, like aerial yoga. Took one star off because the instructions are a microscopic drawing with a terribly illogical commentary written in horrendous English.",4
140594,Just received the wireless keyboard for my husband to use with his new tablet. Was easy to set up. Size matches up with the Samsung Tab E. Magnetic so it has been staying in place. Currently charging with a included USB cable. It appears to be well made for the price. So far so good!,4
149615,Great amount of bubbles generated and really nice smell,4
122738,"This other reviews are right, this ring does run small by about 1/4 size... I ordered a size 5 and it is the exact same size as my 4.75 sized wedding bands .... but for me, that was perfect bc I won’t have to size it down, but something to be aware of, also the ring box it came in was all smashed and smooshed when it arrived and I could barely open the box up... the ring was fine and it worked so that’s all that matters- hopefully the ring holds up",4
146058,This roller pad is acceptable for my use. This eco roller pad was used to apply oil based roof sealant. After 2 hrs of application the pad was still holding up good. I did not attempt to clean and reuse pad. Im pleased with the longevity of this pad due to the type of material being applied.,4
122277,I really love the size of these. They are perfect for my daughter to lay on the floor and color in.,4
154797,"Just one thing, I wish it had a Velcro closure.",4
157367,It’s the only playtex bottle with a design so I liked it.,4
140512,"I love this cover except it the color started fading away from the corners almost immediately after I began using it. Still have all the jewels in tact though. The only other issue I have is the sleep button. The cover is positioned just so, so that it makes it difficult to use the button.",4
137810,"Good value at the price, especially the car charger",4
155489,Pretty solid speakers. Not going to produce much lows but everything else is works fine in my 04 Toyota Sequoia.,4
120748,"Great little device. My only complaint is that it loses sync with my iPad and has to be removed and reinserted from time to time. That said, I’d buy it again because it works. Good for camera bag, etc.",4
140685,"Since it is supposed to be a Dell Package I was surprised to see a HP Keyboard and an offbrand mouse. Monitor and Tower are Dell. Otherwise good review. I know you can use different monitors, mouse and keyboard, but that isn't the point. This might be called false advertising.",4
138900,"I didn't realize I was buying a compact size rather than a full size and that's on me, but the stapler arrived with a few little knicks in the nice bright yellow metallic paint. Didn't seem like a big enough deal to mail it back but was still a little disappointing.",4
151600,Somewhat thin for packing,4
130264,"It fits well, quick delivery.",4
152265,"Got it fast. Great to carry on your lanyard, struggling a little bit to open and close, maybe because it’s new and needs to be broken in. Wish there were more colors to choose from. I’d order all pink!",4
125266,"Really easy installation procedure. Even a child can easily do it. The feeling is so smooth and quite great. Durability, however, is not quite sure. I’ll update the review later.",4
130615,This story is a great read full of adventure and suspense. There are a few editing errors but it is not a distraction. The love scenes are very tame. Overall a great book. This is a stand alone book but could easily be a sequel.,4
158570,I bought a size up and instantly regretted it! Super cute but buy your true size!,4
140603,good for replacement but last a month before it breaks but still good quality,4
140258,I am very pleased with these sheets. They are very soft and fit over my thick mattress pad. I will be buying another set.,4
141356,Very cute book. Good read for the kids.,4
157211,"You know they get the job done the only reason it's 4 stars and not 5 was because I had to bend at certain angles to get the measurement correct and that I didn't step on the little slider. Other than that, it's a good fit and does it's job.",4
155817,"Great for the price, but had to file down many sharp points.",4
142442,"Not as powerful as our old massager, but 1/2 as heavy. Doesn't have different massage types. Just variable speeds. But using the various attachments worked out great.",4
144531,"I would size down at least a half size, these are larger and wider than I expected, but for the price I can deal with it. They are adorable!",4
133862,Fit perfectly on my 2002. Easy to put on. Nothing was broken.,4
149916,"Very soft. I am 5’2 at 108 lbs and order a small. Top runs big, bottom waste runs smal",4
158148,"Love the look of the bell, BUT the ring is very dull.",4
137853,Saw this at a friend's. Had to get one for myself to replace the paper plate. 2 for the price of 1 with this company but they come in a bag with no marking or explanation so you may have to put a note in it if you gift it. Other than that I love it. Kept one. Gave one. :),4
130426,"Not a really bright light and doesn't cover a wide area, but good enough for a walkway.",4
139506,"This was so sweet (literally and figuratively). Ariel went with her sister to get a tattoo (to make sure she went through with it), and Maddox took one look at her and had to have her. He inked her, made her his, and fell instantly. Loved it!",4
144400,"Would give 4.5 if possible! It’s just perfect for our new place and our cat! Wobbles a little more than I imagined when she gets wild playing on it, but with the tension rod there’s no chance of it tipping. Love!",4
140834,Good price and very sturdy.,4
151582,Nice slim good for traveling maybe wouldn’t recommend for shoveling like heavy snow,4
143527,"Didn’t last as long as I had hoped. But worth the price I paid, for sure.",4
144192,"Hi like this product very much. I use it in my Instant Pot for steaming veggies, potatoes rice and fish.",4
145309,It gets confused once in a while on the memory of each user. I just step off and let it reset and all is good. Overall fairly accurate and a good unit for the price.,4
139479,"Great looking and organized closet. The clips do catch on the hangers next to them at times, but they work well.",4
154652,"I love these stickers but one or two of them where a misprint,that means there was one were the sticker was off center or had less colour then the picture.",4
144321,"This book is a perfect cure for gray days, an unexpected cold snap, and everyone under the weather... The tropical location is lovingly described, and the plot threads are all nicely wound up by the end.",4
152999,Beautiful packaging cross smaller than expected but still beautiful I love that it came with an extension on the necklace,4
121184,"This item quality is really good for the low cost. I purchased it, wrongly thinking it included a screen protector. I went ahead and installed a screen protector separately and kept this case because I still considered it good value for the money. The kickstand seems decent. It seems like a sturdy case that will greatly protect.",4
145241,"I have the harbinger ones but these are 100x better than those. Quality seems durable the only thing is, the size is a bit smaller than what they tell you. I measured my wrist and i'm supposed to be a medium. But I think I can use a bigger one.",4
130729,These batteries are fine.. But I ordered them without making good measurements of the space I was going to use them. They did not fit. THAT'S MY FAULT NOT THEIRS. I do have another use for them and I'm sure they will work good there.,4
124908,This product keeps my 6mth old baby occupied and engaged.,4
154734,These hangers are sturdy and thick. Glad I purchased them.,4
152608,"My BP has been running too high and my dr. upped the dosage on my pills. Have had a wrist version for years and it has my BP running too low. Needed something accurate so I tried this upper arm version. I was a bit uneasy about using these, don't really know why, but it was very ease to set up, put on and get an accurate reading. Would have loved to have a bag/case to keep it in and an electric cord to fit it, but it meets what I need.",4
141124,Had no problem setting the lock. Product does exactly what it is supposed to do. A little smaller than I thought. I would buy again.,4
143148,"I like it ok, however, it is different from most sharpeners. Be careful not to over-sharpen...check the point periodically or you will waste lead. It produces a short point rather that a long one, if that makes sense. For the price, it is worth it.",4
143844,"The ribbed material of this suit makes it feel very retro! I kind of like it. The material is definitely good quality and I like the adjustable straps. I wasn't crazy about the color on me, though, the blue is just a bit boring for my tastes. I'm going to try the yellow, but I wish they had more colors on offer!",4
123971,Straws are nice and durable. However they are closer to 9.5 inches long and very thick. They will not fit through the holes in the top of your cups.,4
124817,"I bought this to test it out as an item to keep in the vehicle for emergencies, I guess i will come back and do an update when I actually use it.",4
159925,Used it for pancakes. Kept them warm.,4
133735,"Had these less than a year and one of the legs on one is starting to come apart where it connects. Not too bad, I just hammer back in place but took a star off for that",4
136844,Leggings themselves are a good material and and fit is good; but the waistband has a thick elastic band that is very very tight. *update* Customer service contacted me after I wrote the initial review. I was very happy with the treatment I received and was sent replacement pair of leggings in the same size that fit perfect. The pockets are a great size and these are excellent for running!,4
123662,"One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel yet, although no one screenplay can ever do his books justice.",4
138558,"It is very cute and very well made. The faux fur is really soft and very pleasing to the eye. My only reason for 4 stars is the size. It is a bit smaller than the bags I usually carry, otherwise nice product.",4
122650,"I was crossing my fingers that the two collars I ordered would work. This is a four-Corgi household, and two of them bark a lot. One barks just to bark. So, when a neighbor (nicely and rightfully) complained, I did a lot of research and selected this brand. It took less than a day for Abe and Emmy to catch on once the collars were on them. Ah, ""the sounds of silence""! It's a quality, sturdy product and being able to recharge it rather than buying batteries was a big plus for me. Two observations I'd like to share: (1) one reviewer remarked that the unit was too big for her small dog. Emmy is petite and 22 pounds, and the unit is a bit overwhelming on her neck, too. (2) The unit went off once when Abe shook his head, and once when another dog standing near him barked. Changing the sensitivity eliminated the unit going off when he shakes his head, but not when a nearby dog barks. All in all, this was money well spent!",4
145238,Sound is great! Material could be better the ear cups easily broke down and instantly was uncomfortable if I were to suggest any other headphones at a similar price it would be the RIG 500 pro,4
152656,Worked like a charm. Pay more!,4
129163,I like the overall feel of the case and the fact it has a rubber case and the hard shell case. All that's missing is a screen protector other then that its a great buy at a great price.,4
139905,My dryer is working again. The first one I got was faulty. They refunded my money the second one I purchased worked like charm.,4
134930,"This is a great little humidifier! I have it for my desk at work and it really helps! I will say that the 6 hour run time is definitely off, I fill it at least 2x a day at work (I'm there for 8 hours). This isn't a problem for me though since I don't mind getting up and filling it while at work. I would be scared to leave it on at home while I slept though in case it ran out, i wouldn't want to ruin it. Overall I think it's a great little humidifier for the price!",4
146065,"Have you ever had too much cash for your pockets? Ever thought ""If I only had some way to carry a few grand around...""? If so, I hope a hooker spits in your mouth! Otherwise, it's a bank bag that performs exactly like a bank bag! I didnt give the 5th star because let's be honest, it's a bank bag...",4
130051,"Very smooth, too smooth in fact! You would have to be extra careful as this product makes razors slide right across your skin. I have nicked myself a few times because of it, but it’s a good product and I’m glad to have it. Leaves skin feeling nice and smooth almost like applying body cream.",4
131942,Perfect book!I was so impressed with how this book was written.This is important for us to learn how the machine works for us and how we can develop our skills for creating new products for people. This book provides lots of information that helps you learn the probability and statistics concepts related to machine learning. This book is ideal for people who are into Machine learning.,4
127008,"For a post workout it is probably top 3 on the market. So for the Bad: Dosages for most of the 3 in 1 key features of this product: Creatine, BCAAs and Glutamine are all really low dosages and the recommended are almost twice what are offered here per scoop. You of course can rectify this by taking like a scoop and a half but this is a fairly expensive product. The taste of this product gets a solid D in my eyes, the lime and lemon tastes like battery acid. So for the Good: Quality control for the product is the best in the business, you are going to get quality ingredients and they are going to be consistent. I am a big supporter of post workout recovery drinks and this product will based on my experience help your recovery and help build muscle faster.",4
138030,"Nothing heavy or serious here. Just a good read for lovers of pets and fun loving, problem solving senior citizens.",4
146470,Bras are a bit stiff but for the price it's totally worth it.,4
135624,"This is a very lovely watch, at a very lovely price. My only problem was that it was much smaller than I was hoping for - but not the sellers fault! I mixed up two similar watches the seller had and ordered the wrong one. I decided to keep it anyway - it's more feminine than my usual style and I decided I liked it.",4
153775,Perfect for what I needed. Color was exactly right.,4
148106,Fit decently only on handlebar of bike with adaptors fit loosely with no adapters on bottom pipe of step over curved bike frame,4
127443,super cool effect behind my computers,4
140353,Just as it look in the pic. Grey color.,4
143633,"I am 124 pounds and 5 ft. 2 inches, these fit me perfect. I ordered a medium. The reviews stating they are see through are very correct. As long as you have a shirt that covers your butt then you're good. They are super soft and comfy, washed them and they didn't shrink up a lot.",4
138107,What a good product. Just stand back when opening or closing just in case you let it slip. Definitely will enjoy this again,4
144822,It is not a really durable case but good for price. Held up much better than other cases of same price.,4
130977,Like it worked for my knees,4
152195,this is really different approach to kitchen faucets with the exposed tube that you can move around and just from a look and touch you can tell that the premium material was used to make this faucet and I have had the best time using this item for couple weeks and it works better than expected the only downside or suggestion I came across is the metal part that separates and move the faucet while spraying or using can be made better through magnets instead of clip-on version,4
127325,Love this flavor hard to find in stores buy it here.,4
159663,My daughter wanted a toy axe for Christmas. Who knows why. Lol It’s soft enough not to damage anything. I’d have given it 5 stars if the spray paint smell had been aired out before packaging.,4
130640,"I purchased this hat along with the black acrylic watch hat for my father whose head is on the larger side. The black hat was comfy and had plenty of stretch. This not so much. It's still a nice hat and the quality isn't bad, but it didn't fit like a large. I would say that this would be a good one to consider for a teenager that likes to wear tighter fitting beanies.",4
150291,"The crate is good for the price. It is sturdy and provides enough room for the puppy. We were excited for the divider to have one spot for sleeping and the other for toileting, but the divider did not fit the crate appropriately. Overall this is a noce crate for the price and is safe for the puppy to rest comfortably in.",4
123492,The strainer does hold water in the sink but the basket is smaller than the one I was looking to replace.,4
145244,"Works great. It does make some decent cells. But not like I want. Also, it does leave residue which I have to wipe down every painting I use this oil on.",4
153697,I like the flannel lined shoes. They ran small. I got a second pair the next size larger.,4
154520,"Really Love them, just a bit bigger and it would have been perfect.",4
122645,I used these with my Android phone. I like how they fit in my ears; they're very comfortable. They have very good sound.,4
139767,"Product came promptly and packaged well. Seems to be a quality product. Seals appear to be tight and will not allow light to pass through. For my purposes of emergency water storage I really like the bricks. I gave it 4 stars because the handles are shipped inside the water bricks and 1 of the handles was missing. Not a huge deal but, not a complete package either.",4
145706,I had an apartment dweller that got bedbugs. She said the product did a good job of getting rid of them.,4
149534,"This fanny pack is a beautiful color and the strap is definitely long enough (I have a 42 inch waist) and the strap has room to spare. I do have enough room for most of my essentials, but I can't give it 5 stars, because it didn't have as much room as I had hoped for. It did arrive right on time, if not earlier than expected and the seller was willing to back up their product. I am going to keep this fanny pack because I really like the color. There really aren't too many pretty green fanny packs out there.",4
136880,Seems very which absorbent. It's a bit too thick for my taste.,4
120876,"So tiny! But I really loved that about these earrings!! But I ended up losing the both of them after a month or two which I was very sad about. The backs constantly fell off, which was it's only downfall.",4
137961,nothing bad for the price you pay,4
123838,If I put it in the next year will up date,4
121821,"Like these a lot, great style. Took off a star because the frames hinges got loose really fast.",4
127332,I really like how easy this band was to adjust for the perfect fit. Looks good too!,4
141978,"say you’re sorry was a good book, it also was an easy book to read, i enjoyed it very much..",4
142434,If you travel alone this is a great alternative to giving your phone to someone and asking them to take a picture.,4
152523,Very nice bag. Attractive and sturdy. Well padded. Comfortable,4
155877,Seems to be a good product.,4
122231,These are really nice and work well. When I opens the package they had a very strong plastic smell so I washed them in the dishwasher before using. After making muffins in them they do not have any more funky odor.,4
136103,"Bought for 12 year old son to wear for Halloween, he loved it fits him fine. Husband had to try it on too, and it fit an adult fine as well. Good nostalgic scream mask. Can actually see out of eye holes. Quick delivery!",4
142136,I liked the noise it made when moved. It was not “giant”,4
151320,"It's both fast and slow. If you're an avid drama movie fan, this is a no-brainer. The framing is incredible. The plot heart-wrenching.",4
127903,When you a mom of 17 month old baby you always bending to him and it makes your back more like an arc. So I got this to keep my shoulders straight and still. And it's working just fine. Although price little bit to high on my opinion.,4
121432,It was exactly what I ordered,4
149314,Very soft. A little big for my 4 month old granddaughter (she's 14 lbs) but she can still wear them. She should be able to wear them for awhile which is nice. We'll see how they hold up.,4
128069,I loved them but just know they are really slippery,4
151146,Does what it's made for and will use while at lake fishing,4
150273,"Cute, comfortable and provide support for my toddler whose starting to walk.",4
135664,I enjoyed extra memory card. I love to binge watch my favorite programs with no problems. I would like to order 2 more at this time.,4
124814,I will say I was expecting something cheaply made but I really like this product! It's very soft and comfortable! The color is perfect and the fit is true to size! Definitely would be perfect with a pair of leggings!,4

146410,"Haven't played very long, but good so far. That's why only four stars.",4
143683,"Very cool, worked awesome the hold feature for the last inch lb value is very convenient. Only one complaint is I had to return the first one because the beep indicator would be loud one time and very very soft the next. Never consistent beep tone.",4
142408,Quick read which gives a good first introduction to Blockchain. It motivates to read and learn more in different areas. Thanks Artemis Caro for wrote a helpful book. Thanks .,4
150005,These burn like they say 4-5 hours. pleasant smell keeps the bugs at bay,4
129118,It is not as sturdy as I thought,4
159884,Overall good product. Doesn't work great with some brand bags,4
142301,This does help give me that morning energy I need.,4
148153,"Very sturdy, it arrived already assembled except for the back, and was very useful, it was very easy to clean. Very happy with this product.",4
144939,"Very easy to start using. Automatic pairing with device: so simple and quick. Does not fall out due to external ear attachments. I use them for running. The charging case works well. Cons: a slight rattle at certain angles when running. On calls, the microphone picks up external sounds that the other person on the call complains about. These need to be placed in their case to shut off. Sometimes it’s hard to know if you’ve activated the controls. Just a flat sensor with no feedback ( but the good thing is there is no loud click in your ear ...)",4
135339,I bought these for my brother's house and he liked it it helps woth the mosquito and flys,4
148384,"Great moisturizer for the face, but definitely for the nighttime! I have noticed wrinkle lines looking less severe and less deep.",4
159733,"Has decent sound, works well with Bluetooth, good bass, high end is a bit muddy. Well worth the money.",4
140180,Had issues with my new dot hearing me now it works without repeating Alexa. Would recommend and nice to get off the kitchen counter.,4
152807,...having children.? Watch this film.,4
136337,My two-year-old grandson loves it and after 2 months of still standing so yes I would recommend it.,4
121940,make sure you keep them in a plastic bag. the poor cap design leaks every where if the bottle tips even a little.,4
121565,Boots are comfortable and nice!! They do smell like fake leather but for the price they are perfect,4
144816,Great value. I am happy with this purchase.,4
151376,Great game. Wish there were more weapon options.,4
123980,"The family enjoyed it, but apparently it was too easy for them.",4
153684,Nice material! This looks and fit a lot better than I expected...really nice skirt.,4
142246,These do what they are supposed to do. They are pot scrubbers. I like the cheerful color. They dry fast and therefore no grody sponge smell.,4
130388,Super comfortable. great for walking and washes off.,4
131612,my husband loved the rug. I got it in discount and it was completely worth for price.,4
151377,"A bit thin, but still usable.",4
143132,nice shirt will shrink a little so take that into consideration when ordering,4
155960,"It keeps good time and it is simple to use, but the display is to bright, should be softer. Thank you",4
157449,Exactly the same thing as the $23 branded versions also for sale on Amazon at 1/3 the price. Nothing different except no brand name or box. Works the same. Looks the same. Tastes the same.,4
129008,Worked perfect for my work brick wall ! Absolutely love how easy they are to use .,4
143840,little smaller than I expected,4
130736,"Looks great, works well",4
154725,Works for in between washer and dryer,4
139468,"This necklace is very pretty. The cross is a bit larger than expected, but this adds to its uniqueness.",4
134344,I love PNR and MC so getting this was a no brainer. What I didn’t expect was to enjoy it so much. The H/h in each story were perfect for each other and the supporting characters added to the storylines. The stories themselves flowed well with no lag.,4
151325,"Ok.. just a heads up, I have a dyson, and it doesnt fit in the hose. BUT, my mom has a regular vacuum and it fits!! And it's really cool! It is really great for baseboards and cleaning out the cabinets and drawers! I would totally give this 5 stars but I cant use it, SO it only gets 4 from me. BUT I gave it to my mom and she LOVES IT!!",4
138798,The only thing i have to say is the stitching is good right now but it looks low quality time will tell,4
141505,"Cover for dvd was ripped, only complaint!",4

139369,"I really love this sleep sack for my (tall) 11 month old -- it's perfect now that it's getting colder and very well made. We are in Northern California so our house drops a good 10 degrees between bedtime and morning and on colder nights she's warm and snuggly wearing this and a long sleeved onsie. It has tons of room to grow into, too. The only reason for knocking off a star is the fabric on the top to fold over the zipper isn't quite big enough so the zipper winds up creeping out and she sometimes plays with it, increasing the chance that, as she gets older, she may figure out how to unzip it. A simple change to make the flap bigger or add a snap tab over the zipper would solve it. Regardless, I'm buying a second one! Can't beat the price as well.",4

155217,Good quality material and overall 4/5 only thing I didn’t like was the waist wasn’t true to size but Somehow manageable. Re ordered another pair just bigger size.,4
134210,Great product. I have the solar panel on the camper and it charges all day in south west Florida and it has light for at least three plus hours. Very happy with the quality for the price. We use these lights when we are camping somewhere without electricity hookups- does the job.,4

124446,Durable cord and great bulbs. Very appealing appearance.,4
149797,"My biggest complaints about this are the size and how hard it can be to clean (which also has to do with the size). It's a lot bigger than I expected, though I admit I forgot to check dimensions. It takes up space, so someone with a smaller room, or who doesn't have many tables/surfaces (like me) this might not be the best. The size can also make it difficult to clean. Most wax melts will just pop out when they're hard, but not all, and the wax sticks to the sides of the dish and is REALLY hard to get off without using a knife.",4

Vick happened to be staying at the house at the time and died in the fire. This book is so loaded with action and of course you know Tom will never allow the lost of his love to die down.

145387,"Light weight and looks great! The battery life could use some improvement but as the battery stabilized after several uses, the battery life seemed to have improved but I'm still only about a week into using it.

148037,Exactly what we were looking for. Road trips with a 6 year old just got better. We had an RCA before and it was the worst quality i have ever seen produced by a well known company.,4
157353,This thing cuts well. Not as well as a typical mower but you never have to worry about packing it up for the winter. Simple machine that starts when you start. I think if I would have went smaller I could take turns faster on it and minimize passes needed. It jams up on twigs so make sure you keep your lawn tidy and things go smoothly.,4
150242,Helps with the commute so much. Only down side is it is it can get pretty hot and leave you with a sweat beard.,4

110384,Got scratched s soon as we out the wheels of the chair on it but good enough for what is for.,3

96210,"Simple to install and does the job, kind of. They seem like they give a somewhat snug fit but it really doesn't take a heavy landing for them to pop off. If you put just a dab of glue I'm sure they would do the job just fine but also become a permanent attachment. They definitely help keep the camera from smacking objects while landing..

90270,"I like that the book is comparable to others in this genre. In that respect it was what I expected and was an enjoyable read. I was put off by how unrealistically the main characters deal with the aftermath of their respective traumas. They act as if once the immediate trauma is over then all is right in the world and life moves on normally. This is so not how reality works. However, to have the characters deal with their issues realistically the book would need to be twice as long and the romance aspect of the story would have shrunk down to a subplot.",3
117961,"The editing of this ebook has unfortunately caused me to rate this lower than the story warrants. The normal convention of separate paragraphs when each person speaks is absent, and causes the reader much confusion regarding who is speaking. In addition, on my kindle there is no space between a "" and the next word. This makes for a VERY confusing read and detracts unnecessarily from a very good and engrossing tale. I encourage fans of historical fiction - and by that I mean true history that is well researched, with believable characters who appear genuine members of that time period (true and believable medical terminology of the day, etc) to stick with the story despite the editorial challenges. It is well worth the read and would be a 5* novel without the issues mentioned. The story is a good one, and the life of Catherine, the protagonist, continues as this is the first of a series of novels.",3
115463,does not work as well as i thought it would,3
117951,this is the fourth or fifth time that i've ordered these. the box needs additional coverage to ensure that the covers inside stay clean,3
84367,"I like the screen protector, seems good quality for the money. I don't like how this leaves raised edges on my Moto Z Force, makes it easy to remove or get snagged and pull up; -1 star. Also, the oversized white release plastic is stupid. The oversized plastic makes the installation videos useless because you can't use the ""hinge"" method for installing. Being white and non-transparent also prevents install because you can't see your phone for alignment. These two issues will knock another star.. easy fix for the manufacturer. Ultimately I installed it using the old fashion way and it worked out just fine.",3
97856,"These are so cool, but I had to return - the screw part was way too long for my cabinets...",3
84599,Love this formula! This was the first time I ordered formula from Amazon received container with lid broken off. Disappointing! I would give 5 stars for the formula!!!,3
103771,This unit is kind of loud and constantly runs to keep the room cool. It is used to cool a room 10x 20 which is in the range of square footage that should be enough for this unit to cool.,3

83935,"The good: It works. No more clicking and clanging waking up the baby. The bad: I had a heck of a time getting it on. The picture makes it look like there is some kind of easy screw-on ring to secure the tags in the cover, but there's not. There is a very small opening on the top, that is extremely difficult to push the dog tags into while simultaneously threading the ring through. The ring is a small, thin, metal key-chain type ring, and after threading through 2 dog tags at the same time, it no longer lays flat. I'm pretty sure that in 3 years when I have to renew my dog tags, I'll have to get a new cover entirely.",3
87553,A little large for our 12-pound dog. It didn't work out for us because she started walking funny and we were worried she'd slip on our wood floors.,3
84430,The tips get connected to the hose with a screw on adapter. this is nice but the adapter kept coming off the hose when under presser. You will need to glue in place for it to work well.,3

107615,I havent tried the product just yet but when I do than I will give my feedback on it,3
82422,Good battery. Ee aware it is raised in the back for ventilation. Good for the computer bad for your lap! It hurts if positioning on your lap. I ordered a radiation shied which served the added purpose of making a portable platform for the lap top so it does not dig in.,3
114726,A little bit small and noisy. Keep you dry in the snow,3
95710,I wanted to love these. They are beautiful real leather shoes but they were too off white and appeared dirty next to white clothes. I ordered a 5 for my toddler because her sneakers are 5's and have a lot of room but the back of her foot goes right up to the back of this sandal with no room to grow the rest of the season. The bottom of the sandal doesn't feel too flexible for a little one.,3
115766,tastes okay. i just wanted a more natural less processed product. mixes well. best if mixed with fruits or other flavor items if you want a more flavorful shake.,3
113489,Great price but MISTAKE! I have a 16 yr old daughter! I meant to get Woman’s Day or something! THIS is WAY too sexual and frankly filled W ridiculous articles!,3
82567,The neck of this jumpsuit is shape really realy weird u have to keep pulling it dwn on ur shoulders....other than that this is perfect i love it,3

80125,Thought there was a face protector,3
114526,"I'm a bit disappointed. Threaded pieces are hard to install; I filed down one of them to assemble it without cross-threading it. You cannot make a foot-long threaded tube, saw cut it into 1-inch long pieces, and expect them to thread well. You must chamfer the edges. Made in China, what do you expect? But don't blame the Chinese, blame the cheap company making them there and not training proper machining methods, or cheaping out on it because they don't care about quality. Also, this came from CA to OH in its original packaging, nothing else, which I don't think was built for that kind of travel/shipping. The styrofoam packaging is pretty thin, and there was damage to the ceramic around the bulb mounting point. I do not think it is a functional issue, but I super glued it back together anyway just in case. Hopefully it holds up to the heat of the lamp. I saw no mention to not touch the bulb with bare hands, which is a big no-no with halogen bulbs. Fortunately I already knew that.",3
117825,"Beautiful, but a little darker than some of the pics made it look.",3
80919,Fair. You get exactly what you pay for with this price point. Screen extremely hard to see in direct sunlight. Getting watch to light up when you lift your wrist is hit and miss. Tends to turn on when you don't want it to - like when your sleeping. Very bright in a dark room. Still haven't gotten the sleep data to work.,3
107275,Have used it for six months. Energizes me.,3
80336,Not well constructed.,3

107170,"I liked how fast they shipped my order. Took them less than 2 days after I ordered them. But I felt like they rushed on the packaging. I have some dents on my table that it seemed like it was dropped. I'd rather wait a week later than getting a damaged table especially if it's worth $400. Other than that, table is very spacious and sturdy.",3
88656,These were very small for an x-large which is what I usually wear. The stretch was minimal. I've given them to someone else who should be able to use them and she was very excited about the pockets ... which is why I bought them in the first place. Not sure if I want to try a larger size because the x-large was so small and tight. It would have cost me $6 to have them picked up to return since I cannot get out to stores and such for the free return.,3
104921,"The case seems decently made. I don't feel like the glass screen is big enough, I can see the lines down the sides and have to press hard on my screen and it's making noise to where it sounds like there are air bubbles (which there isn't). In the description it says the place to put the lanyard is on the top, mine is on the bottom? Zizo has contacted me and sending me a replacement screen protector. Very much appreciated, hopefully will not have the same issue.",3
85973,"It seems to be working fine. The first one was broken. Very poorly packaged in some lightweight bubble wrap and tossed in an untaped box. Replacement was also damaged but I used it anyways, I needed to get this project finished.",3
95092,Haven't used it yet but one of the stones came unglued. Not sure what glue to use to get it back on since it's my first sharpening stone.,3
91391,"I cannot say I am happy with this unit. I like the size, I like the color of the back-light, but that is where my acceptance ends. I have found it quite useless for my needs in my 4Runner. No matter where I position it, I cannot read the time without activating the back-light. The temperature gauge is in Celsius, and as an American, it doesn't mean a whole lot to me. The mounting bracket is extremely flimsy and will undoubtedly break with too much adjustment. There were no instructions in the package, but adjusting the time wasn't too difficult to figure out. The Clock is very affordable and compact. It should be perfect for my needs. Sadly the amount of effort needed to see the display means too much time with my eyes off the road, which is extremely unacceptable for me. The battery life seems to be exceptional, but time will tell. The CR2032 Battery isnt hard to find, but it also isnt very common. I have tons of them because of other interest, so it isnt an issue to replace them. The clock has potential, but I think where I need it to be is where it falls short. If you have an area in your car that isnt exposed to sunlight, then this clock should be useful. I suggest you mount it temporarily to make sure it will work in your desired location.",3
107184,"This cardigan is okay. The design along the openings is nice and the pockets are always a bonus! It fits a little small in the arm openings and isn't particulary longer than any other cardigan I've bought, so maybe don't let that part of the description headline influence your decision to buy. I think the major drawback is that it leaves fuzzies. Everywhere. At first I thought it was just because I chose to wear a navy shirt under it, and being that I ordered the Khaki color, it was just a poor color combo choice. Nope. Fuzzies in my hair, all over my desk, all over my desk chair, and I'm sure everywhere in between. I had to deduct one star for the smaller than expected fit, and the second for the fact that the sweater sheds everywhere. I will likely keep it because it isn't a bad sweater, and I'll hope that the fuzzies are just a result of it being a new sweater, and that this shedding will stop shortly.",3
97323,Not sure what the weight limit is on these but mine broke. Husband had to fix it.,3
82556,It actually worked well but now that I have used it a couple of months the Velcro doesn’t stay and the metal comes out of the little pouch,3

83786,I used it for my MacBook Pro...the product is ok but not as easy to install. I followed the instructions and used the products given to get rid of lint but still ended up with some underneath. It was a bit annoying trying to get it on. I managed to eventually get it on.,3
101534,I used it to store a bunch of my photography gear. Having the clear panel is a big help in locating exactly what I needs. One negative is that the zipper blew out on one of the compartments.,3

108008,The s-pen that it came with didn't work so I had to order a new one.,3
81752,"It does track your heart rate, but the measurement seems a bit low (on mine at least). Works okay for telling if your heartrate increases or decreases so if you can match a reading with your target zone you can use it to maintain a target heartrate (though the exact bpm of your target heartrate might not be perfectly correct). It's got a pedometer too which works okay, and the app is kinda cool.",3

However, the mesh pocket on the side that I use to store a couple extra outfits has ripped after only a couple of weeks. It’s not like I stored something heavy or sharp in there. A little disappointed with the quality and durability. However, after posting this review, I received a new one free of charge. I will try that one out and update my review if it works. Maybe the first one I received was just a dud. I’m willing to give it a second try.",3
118856,"It looked good when new. It heats well. Controls are good. But after extended use, the white side and the red side separated. Still stiched together all around the edges but loose in the middle. The worst feature is that it is clingy and sticks to the sheets and comforter.

So far, it has protected my phone nicely, and I probably tend to drop my phone more than most people. This case looks good on the phone; however, it shows a lot of finger prints-- as much or more as the actual iPhone screen does. If you aren't bothered by fingerprints or don't mind cleaning it very often, this case would be great. The problem with cleaning the case frequently, though, is that it must be disassembled every time it needs cleaning because otherwise water gets trapped between the clear case and the plastic rim. And it's a little hard to get both pieces off the phone, which is probably why the plastic rim has broken on mine. So for convenience and practicality (related to cleaning), it's not at the top.

Doesn't really work so well as a blackout curtain - more like a room darkening curtain. I like my room super dark, so I have a blackout curtain behind these. But I love them. Beware of pet hair - it sticks to velvet like glue. I got the royal blue color which was surprisingly beautiful. it's a little darker than the stock photo, so if you're looking for a deeper blue this is it.",3

The result is a 640x480 picture with no control over zoom, resolution, color, etc. There is a dial on the cable that adjusts the brightness of three LEDs next to the camera lens. The LEDs get pretty bright, though I am unsure as to whether or not they are effective.

114071,"The winder works, but my husband has not yet repaired the piece which holds the pillow. Either the screw used to secure the large rectangle to interior of the box was too short, or the hole was mis-drilled or the small wooden block in the space where the wires are held is mounted incorrectly. It may be a combination of these factors. My husband has let it sit since Christmas because he has another winder that works ok. It was packed very securely as another reviewer commented.

The vendor's customer service department has always been outstanding, immediately sending out replacements during the warranty period. With windows 10, it was plug and play. However,It failed to improve reception above that I experienced with a small compact adapter from a different manufacturer that I had been using. The bulky antenna I thought would add to durability, but tonight while moving a desktop computer, the adapter case broke off in 2 parts and the adapter is no longer recognized. I expect that the vendor will replace it. If you're able to deal with the downtime associated with failure I would recommend it's purchase because of the quality of the customer service.",3

The mouse platform is not very sturdy and i had to fold a business card and stick it under the area it connects to the stand so it didn’t flex to much under the weight of my hand. The area that is suppose to fit a laptop is a tap small for a typical dell laptop. Legs are sturdy but not the best but at least the angle clips stay in place.,3

There is no adjustable recline for this seat, and unless you purchase the angle adjuster separately, your front seats will have to be all the way forward. I am only 5ft 2in and could not have my seat a comfortable and safe distance from the steering wheel. I was able to fit 3 across in my 2013 Ford Explorer, but again it’s the length that’s the issue.

103134,"This is my first book from this author. The book is a short read. A billionaire, Spencer, meets and educated girl from the hood. Kriss is thoughtful and at times over the top tough. She has sass and much attitude, at times too much for me, but the book is a decent read. Spencer and Kriss are from different worlds but both have families and friends who obviously care about them. They finally get together after Kriss pushes his advances away. Their relationship develops quickly and is filled with moments of jealousy and arguing, and making up. The book ends in a happy ever after. Pros: The book is short but has a plot. Kriss finally isn’t so hard and shows she has fears. Spencer is a decent character. Cons: The grammar is okay, not great. Too wordy, with extra words that bring no substance to the book. A lot of design name dropping, which has become the norm in our culture. The Malcolm scene, her ex, was odd and seemed to be thrown in. The designer that he still employed, but who had a thing for him was unresolved. Spencer’s enemy family was a decent part of the book book sort of fizzled out. The ending and her being you know what could be seen a mile away. Overall: My first time reading this author was okay. I would buy her next book. I hope she does away with the wordy content, it’s distracting. Get to the point.",3

90137,"First off, I'll start by saying that these are undoubtedly the brightest T10 LED bulbs on the market. I've tried about 9 or 10 different brands and nothing comes even close to these in regards to the lumens produced. Now let's talk about the build quality. Originally, Alla Lighting had these bulbs with thinner connectors (refer to the picture, the bulb on the left) that would constantly break off due to poor soldering. Then Alla introduced the ""New"" version with thicker connectors (refer to the picture) that were supposed to eliminate the breaking off problem, however, as you can see for yourself, it did not work. Overall, I have spent a couple of hundred dollars due to constantly having to replace the failed bulbs. Eventually, I had to switch to a different brand, one with a different connector design (picture on the right), which will never break off, but had to sacrifice on the brightness. I will not purchase anymore of the Alla Lighting T10 bulbs until the connection design is completely changed.",3
