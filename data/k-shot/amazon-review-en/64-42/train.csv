84660,"I‚Äôm giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn‚Äôt realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn‚Äôt. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don‚Äôt know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.",3

Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on).

I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus.

One chair had a washer for the ‚Äúneck‚Äù piece, the other didn‚Äôt. Biggest issue, whether you use a drill or screw driver, you will see the tips of the screws poke through the face of the animal (see picture). If you try to avoid this and don‚Äôt screw them in as far, you‚Äôre left with a wobbly chair. A disappointing finish to what could be a great piece.",3

It's just a smidge too wide for where I need it with both extenders, but a bit too small if I use only one of them. The screws, then, are extended to their maximum amount not allowing for tightening. The gate is purposely agape to adjust to the tightening of the tension screws. You tighten up until the door meets the latch. Right now, I have it fit sort of kitty-corner between the two walls which is not ideal as I can't keep it at the proper tension.

138794,"These are plain pitted prunes, on the small side and a little dry, with excellent flavor. You may need more of them than usual to create a laxative effect. But they are easy to eat straight from the package and absolutely fine with oatmeal or yogurt in the morning. I ordered them when my local grocery was out of prunes for some reason and was glad to be able to get these from Amazon.",4
123495,"Writes smoothly and cleanly. Does not dry up and clog between uses. I use it for drawing. I have the extra fine and just ordered the medium. It arrived with the barrel snapped in three pieces. It was shipped in a flexible bubble envelope which probably got bent during shipping. This item is not returnable, but when I contacted Amazon, I did receive a refund. So I am going to order it again and hope it arrives undamaged.",4
126838,Good screen for the money - looks good. Just hate that it uses most of the GPIO pins which keep them from being used for other things. Otherwise pretty nice.,4
121244,"Tree is beautiful and lights are the perfect brightness. Sadly, the first windy day the tree broke off of the base. Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base. I solved the problem by creating a new base using 18"" long 1/2"" black iron pipe to push inside the tree's metal tube, then attached that to a 1/2"" black iron pipe flange. This flange was then welded to 4 legs of 2"" angle iron, each 15"" long. The base is then held down with 2 sandbags.",4

122529,"I was stunned by this book held my interest throughout. The relationship between the two lead female characters was an unexpected, but welcome development. Although I received the book from instant freebies, I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.",4
147696,best buy is at Costco or Smith&Final,4
129028,I found it easy to set up but it is a little tricky getting it to lock in place so you can use it. I haven't placed it in the dishwasher so I can't say that it's dishwasher safe. It easier to use a bottle brush and clean it with soap and water. I love having two bottles. Great for the price.,4
159377,The antelope color is not the same as I expected it to be. Looks different online.,4
142051,"looks better in person than online. somewhat hard to tighten the band by yourself, also can be uncomfortable if you tighten too much since it is not a flexible band.",4

155349,Is OK but runs small,4
140993,"I ordered a size up because my butt is larger than the rest of me, and like every other pair of jeans/shorts I buy, the waist is too big. You can see my underwear in these if I don‚Äôt have something underneath. They are good quality though.",4
140570,I just wish it would save the names.,4
121773,"Great knife for the money. As other reviews have noted, this is a bulky knife. Not something you‚Äôd want to carry in your pocket everyday. Blade is nice and solid/thick, and sharp, but the action is not as smooth or lightening fast as I was hoping it would be. Overall, solid everyday work knife for sure!",4
152848,They are comfortable except hard to get used to with the controls ..... buttons in odd places,4
134683,"Overall good product, except for handset screen could be brighter to read",4

147138,"Let me first say that this mouse was the perfect shape, weight, and in my opinion the ideal mouse for any FPS. It just isn't compatible with the microsoft surfacebook 2. It freezes and jumps around every so often.",4
138412,It was the perfect gift for a family member who enjoys handheld poker electronic games. My reason for 4 stars is that it has a small screen.,4
129241,Only complaint is that it's battery operated only for the sound machine and vibration. Both were much needed for a newborn. Very disappointed that it didn't come with a plug option. Otherwise it looks great and great quality.,4
155995,Cute and a great piece to wear for any costume,4
146735,I like these bands! Colors are bright and vibrant. My only gripe is the two holders for the excess band slide too easy.,4
155058,"Pretty easy to assemble. The quality is decent I just wish it was taller to watch movie while sitting in chairs. The screen is pretty short. Originally I put it up for movie and it fell back cause of strong winds, good thing it came with stakes and rope to stake it down for stability.",4
155395,Great info from a history buff,4
149807,"This is a great purchase for the price. Works great, speed is great and i appreciate that it comes with the extra blade replacement pieces. My only complaint is that it does not come with a plug for the USB cord, thought that was odd. But considering the savings, compared to $15 for most electric sharpeners and the fact that most items we have use USB cords, we are fully stocked. That was the only reason for 4 out of 5 stars",4
157289,"I was skeptical about ordering this, but thought anything had to be better than what we had. We got it out of the box and into the camper. We have not slept on it yet. But we have laid on it for couple minutes and so far I am super impressed. I am debating on replacing our bunk beds as well. Well worth the money. Only reason I‚Äôm rating it 4 stars is because we have not slept a night on it yet.",4
128657,Cute his and her keychains. Very sturdy,4
134853,"They are pretty cool, but don‚Äôt drop them. Very easy to dent the metal ring.",4
142262,The Bottoms Did Not Fit My height,4
130936,We like that it‚Äôs insulated and we like that it‚Äôs unbreakable. It Is hard to press sometimes though. I don‚Äôt know if this is because the grind we are using is too fine? It is aesthetically pleasing. Overall we are very happy thank you.,4
140064,These were perfect size to go inside the ACE bandage I was wearing. The sleeve kept it from direct skin contact but allowed the cold through. These were somewhat difficult to activate but this prevented accidentally breaking the inner bubble.,4
157959,"I loved the variety of colors and craftsmanship of each bow. Beautifully made. The clips, however, will not clamp onto the hair causing the bows to fall off of the hair.",4
141982,"Be careful when tightening the fittings, especially the fittings in the Tankless heater, ensure you use a wrench to hold the fitting there not to twist off or damage the copper fitting piping inside the heater. And use the right size wrench and not pliers or channel locks, because you can damage or round off the the edges of fittings. Phasing the fittings is easy to get the alignment you need.",4
137110,"Nice headphones for the price. I love the rich rose gold color that matches my iPhone and accessories. The sound is really good and everyone can hear me clear as well. The music clarity is good and has a nice volume level. The only thing is the distance of the headset to the phone is a little short for good reception. It even announces the caller by name or number. Overall, I like this product.",4
143244,The story is gripping and it really draws you in. My only complaint is the author seemed to bounce around a bit and didn‚Äôt explain who was whom very well.,4
142791,"I was hesitant on these, my wife bought them. I installed them and am very pleased with the look and function.",4
30074,"Very, very thin, you can bend them with you fingers with no problem! Print is small.. More of a decoration. Would give 1/2 star!",1

4082,Broke down after a month's use!!,1
9447,"It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.",1

6603,When I received this book the first 68 pages were missing. Absolutely unacceptable for even a used book. Makes no sense why it would be shipped like this,1
22725,The color cartridge does not work. I have tried everything that I can think of and my printer will not accept the color cartridge. I have to put the old color cartridge back in the printer just to be able to use the black cartridge.,1
809,"unbreathable item, I though it is because of the size; so I decided to replace the item but the issue as a customer you must pay for the refound shipping which cost around 4 dollars and the item itself 9 dollar .. doesn't make any sense !!!!",1
37747,The aspect ratio is so bad I could not watch it. I really wanted to. Why has this not been corrected? Something really out of whack.,1

21614,"I wear a size 18/20 woman's t-shirt, blouse, etc. Sometimes they call this a 1X . So I ordered a XXL to be sure it would fit. I could barely get this t-shirt over my head and on. Once it was on I could barely breath. The quality & printing on the shirt are GREAT. If they let me return these I am going to order (4) XXXXL to replace them that's how impressed I was the quality.",1

39479,Just got the case and it‚Äôs too small. What the heck??? Anyone else had this problem???,1
37469,I really want to give this suit a 5 star but I can‚Äôt. The appearance is beautiful and I love the color. But sadly the top is to big. I followed the sizing chart for around the bust size. It all fits there but the cup size in a xxl looks as if it is a triple d or a double d. I am a larger girl being 249 but my chest is smaller. Would love to exchange sizes but cant find anywhere to message sender.,1

Come on amazon!! Stop letting people sell fake stuff on here!!,1
39436,"I used this wax on my entire body, I had to go over areas on my legs more than once. I used the entire can and ultimately had to shave afterwards because the wax was not working. For legs, arms, underarm, etc I had to use a razor after to clean it up. For Brazilian front and back, the front was ok I still had to go over with a razor and the back didn't really work I had to just shave. The hair grew back faster than usual Im guessing because I pretty much shaved (since the wax didn't remove the hairs). I have course curly hairs but Ive never had a wax not work. I've been waxing for a while and this has to be the worse wax. Ive paid less for waxes that work on all of my body parts leaving it smooth for weeks. I bought this wax and had to go back to razors and razors are terrible for me due to the amount of ingrowns after. Highly disappointed and upset I wasted money.",1

6540,"so, this thing is like a big fat crochet hook designed to grab the inside lip of the jacuzzi ball and pull. Which would be great, except that it's ONE QUARTER INCH TOO SHORT. Maybe Kohler changed their design to make it deeper, or something, but this tool is next to USELESS for removing jets from my tub. Instead of the ball lip, all you can ""grab"" is the sloped ledge inside the ball, which with a LOT of persistence and side pressure might eventually get the insert to let go. We finally ""modified"" the tool by melting portions of the stop-ball away, making it more functional and much less pretty. Caveat Emptor.",1
