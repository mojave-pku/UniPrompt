An electric pump would be better. Also the ball immediately begins to deflate once the pup is removed. I gave it 3 stars for durability. I have not been able to use it because it is not full of enough air.,3

100033,"I have a turtle beach headset for my xbox one, so it was a no brainer to get one for my recently purchased PS4. However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else. Sorry turtle beach, but your xbox headsets are just way better..",3

144645,"I bought the kitchen shears for preparing chicken for Asian dishes. We enjoy free range chicken on the bones so I needed to have shears that can cut through breast bones. These shears have comfortable handles and is very sharp. The shears can also be used to open bottles and can scale fish. I like the fact that the shears can come apart which makes it easy to clean them. The shears come with a magnetic sleeve to hang them on the fridge, but mine was warped so it did not stick on the fridge.",4
141273,Product was available very quickly. Very nice color. Thinner than I expected.,4
153723,"This tent is perfect for my wife and I. Set up is crazy easy and our tent was up in seconds compared to our friends who have traditional tents. It is spacious and left plenty of room even after our queen size mattress was in it. The only downside is that if you want any privacy you have to have the fly on because the whole top of the tent is mesh. If your not in some shade, with the fly on its get pretty warm pretty quick when the sun is shining since there aren’t really windows to unroll and let a breeze through. Usually you camp under some trees however so this shouldn’t be a problem too often. Overall we love this tent! The blue color is a plus too because it really stands out and looks beautiful!",4
140365,The story capture my attention and the tempo of the story is well organized.,4
136135,"The kids are great. I bought them with the stands to start sprouting with jars. They worked fine. Honestly though, I would have liked something simple like a cheap plastic jar tipper...but thought, at the time that more fancy was better. Not necessarily true. You dont need to be able to tip jars at unlimited angles...just far enough to get the water out without clogging the holes.",4
136303,I love the idea of these bags and I use them to keep food fresh in the freezer. My one complaint is that it can be hard to get them open and closed.,4
123350,So good for hanging tools on. Clip could be slightly tighter to prevent it lifting up when removing tools.,4
120678,the product is definitely versatile and good idea to keep around for any family accident. keeping ours.,4
156525,It was a trial for me. Not really my type of book. I would read others. The storyline was okay,4

142131,"I like the clear cup because it allows you to see the tea strength and I loved the top because it holds the tea bag and it can be used to drain the liquid out of the tea bag. However after the 3rd time I used the tea cup tea leaked into the lining of the cup and can no longer be used, very disappointing.",4

122504,"you have to make sure the zipper is in the correct direction or you end up not locking the bag. However, when you get used to that it is good.",4
127161,Great fitting earpiece that was really easy to mold. Would have been 5 starts if they had provided a second adaptor so you could have both a right and a left earpiece in at the same time. Price is a bit expensive for only one fully functional earpiece.,4
138310,"We've been using this to treat IBS and leaky gut, as well as get gut flora back into optimal range after years of medications. Over time we have noticed a huge improvement in regularity and cramps. Very much worth trying!",4
152118,"Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.",4
124030,Really nice looking in person. Keeps everything at temp.,4
121615,Not bad. Beans are better than grounds if you have the tool to grind it.,4

130973,"Too big for my wrist! (I’m female, early 30s, 5.5” and average body complexity). And it is also too big for my mom’s wrist. I bought 2 of them: wine red one for me and black one for my mom. Too bad they don’t offer different sizes in this band. I was very disappointed at first because I love how slim these bands are! I was going to return them but then I decided to buy a tool to make holes instead and I did, spent only $7 on it and it worked perfect and we are both very pleased with our bands! We made 2 MORE holes on each band!!! (With the same distance between holes as original holes). These smart watches are meant to be kind of tight on your wrist, well not tight, but touching the skin all around, so it can feel the heartbeat, track your exercise, track your sleep at night, etc, so having them even a little loose is useless to me.",4

130641,works ok but are smaller than i thought they should be i guess that is why they don't sat they are for tractors,4
148864,I ordered this product a size larger than I normally wear and it was snug. 2 sizes larger would probably have fit perfectly. The fabric is soft and breathable. These are easily dressed up for work or to be made more casual.. very versatile,4

9014,"These cards don't make sense. The ""Thank you"" has nothing to do with the cartoons on the cards. Several of the cards were misprinted and the cartoon was cut off. I returned them as a result. I'm glad they were misprinted so that I didn't have to keep them. Because of the cartoons, they should be blank inside, not say ""Thank You""",1

20061,"I've been using Guitars for a while and while this model looked good initially, it deteriorated very quickly there after. Only after 1 month of light-use (2-3 hours a week), it started degrading. The grip of the strings started to loosen up and no matter how many times you tighten it up it always loosens immediately on playing and causing a weird tone while strumming. That is not how a good guitar should function!",1

I put in brand new batteries and could hardly feel any air coming out even with the stupid thing three inches from my face.

23223,I pre ordered this book because I really like the first few books. This one however is a total let down. This is a fictional story and the trashy political jabs should have been left out. The story would be just fine without the author interjecting her personal political views. Start a blog if you want to rant about the Trump administration. Don't make your customers pay for it.

It is so cool to be sitting in a restaurant and show a friend a view of your home on your cell phone. The DVR setup is a pain but the cell phone setup is SO easy!!
