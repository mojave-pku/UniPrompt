156282,This pot is on point. Very good. No sticking.very easy to clean and cooks perfectly fine,4
133660,"These fit well and are very comfortable but are rather frail. Best hand washed or, as last resort, washed on delicate/cold water in the washing machine. Do not dry in the clothes drier if that can be avoided.",4
157316,"Not really a blue light at night, more like a yellow white light. Still, it's better than nothing.",4
141204,"I was skeptical but my better half ordered two of these. We made use of the suggestions from other people who bought these and gave them a good review. Very sturdy. We put them together with the addition of gorilla glue on the pegs. We assembled them and let them sit overnight to let the adhesives dry and do their job. The cranky comments from people who didn't follow the instructions, moving the item right after assembly, not assembling them properly, etc. are tiresome. This is not heirloom furniture but it does the job if you put it together properly.",4
27746,Says it was delivered and I never received it. Unsure of how to contact seller,1
37654,Had to constantly change battery. Worked sometimes,1
15250,"This is the worst scale I've ever owned. I can step on the scale without clothes and then again fully clothed and weigh the exact same thing. It's almost like this scale remembers your last weight and if it's close, just displays the same thing over and over. Other scales I've had in the past are so accurate that you can literally see an ounce difference when you add or remove weight. DO NOT buy this thing if you are weighing in daily or keeping close track of your weight. All it is good for is a generalized number and is definitely not accurate!",1
18387,"Needlessly had way too many alien species. Physics as described made no sense. Like the human eye could see ships across a solar system, or see laser beams in vacuum Portals visible at distances described.",1
115171,"Great product ....while it lasts, which isn’t long. It starts to lose power/strength of vibrations very quickly after first purchasing it and continues to diminish until the product stops working completely. Many speeds that are great and it’s rather strong when it’s operating at its full power capacity. If you’re looking for a quality made product, there are probably better choices but for a (fairly) cheap toy, it works well.",3
104384,The story line was good but not enough love/sex scenes for a romance novel. Maybe I just expect more.,3
95389,I was sent a different shade than I ordered.,3
105667,You might as well just dump this stuff out and replace it with some apple cider vinegar. It doesn't work as well and dries up fast. It will still kill a few here and there but not as fast as the apple cider vinegar on its own. Save your money and get the large bottle at the store and you'll be fine.,3
164368,"I used this product for a spring party, and it worked out great. Pair it up with the Hawaiian shaved ice flavors and you have a hit",5
161787,Fits and looks sleek. The extension should fit angled grip and small light.,5
173895,Great for beginners and travel,5
196665,"Great quality! Just what we needed! Fit was good, easy to take on and off. We have it by our pool area and great knowing TV is protected when not in use.",5
79853,For the price I figured they wouldn’t be as good as the more expensive ones but they are made of extremely thin sheet metal. Have a 1-2” gap around them and do not even include rubber for the edges just a foam round foam sticky pad for the bottom corner. If you aren’t looking for quality or a tight fitting door then these are for you! If you want something that actually seals up the lowers then purchase a different product,2
47356,"These wipers clear the windshield well but are very noisy, will not buy again.",2
47801,"Probably dont get this if you need a protector because you drop your phone frequently. I dropped my phone and the entire protector just popped off (because it attaches around the circumference of the screen, unmentioned in the product description) and the entire right side of my screen is all cracked now. Probably fine if you just want to protect your screen from scratches? I guess.... Wishing their ""Lifetime Replacement Warranty"" worked to replace my phone. Also, this thing definitely is not smudge resistant, which isn't important to me, but worth mentioning.",2
75100,"Wasn’t what I expected, material really thin and the speakers keep shifting in the headband, it doesn’t stay aligned with the ears.",2
