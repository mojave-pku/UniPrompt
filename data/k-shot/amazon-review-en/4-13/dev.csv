19476,These were SO cute and I had planned on putting them in gift bags for my classmates in nursing school for Christmas...however when I opened them they were coated with some sort of oily substance and smelled so strongly of chemicals! I soaked them in hot water and Dawn dish soap and then thoroughly cleaned each and every one of them ...as soon as they dried the smell returned...I threw them in the trash after seeing that the oily residue was even leaving marks on my kitchen table. I don't know what it was but I was very disappointed in this purchase and was completely unable to use the product at all.,1
