55460,"First off, this took weeks to get here. I didn't realize it was shipping from China or I would have paid a few bucks extra and gotten one that was Prime. I don't hold that against the seller it's just that I didn't realize that when I bought it. The actual product is kind of crap. I tested the first 3 keychains, #1 worked just fine and is on my car keys. #2 didn't work at all, and #3 works some of the time (I have it velcro'd to my Fire remote). I thought at first maybe the receiver just doesn't work through walls (even though the transmitter was about 10 feet away)- but the keychain transmitter was able to ping in the exact same location so it's just a faulty transmitter. It does ping sometimes - but every time it has been after I'd already found the dang thing and brought it close to the transmitter to test that it was working at all. Defeats the point! I'm really disappointed in this product and based on 2 out of 6 (again, I didn't test the other 3 so it might be a higher %) not functioning as they should I'd say give this particular product a pass. One of the tested transmitters DID work and works well, so it's not a 1 star - maybe I just got an old/bad set.",2
46956,Didn’t notice anything.,2
65690,Some of these waterers are just too large at the bottom & the water just guzzles out. I’ve had others that work much better.,2
71874,The gems kept fall off my nails. I did better with nail glue.,2
50365,"Kind of ok, I tried it once haven't again, all I can say. Wasn't anything like what the reviews I read!",2

53966,product material and style is perfect but is sizing is not perfect,2
43942,My puppy has shown little interest in this toy and it was smaller than expected. I would recommend for super small/young puppies. Not for medium puppies over 10 weeks old.,2
44691,While I really appreciated the fine mesh on this. After a couple months of semi regular use the spot welds that hold the arms on fell apart. Booo...,2
44934,Three months later and the heel fell off completely in middle of school.,2
71227,"Not sure whether they are old stock or just cheap cells, but the batteries Didn't even last a month before I noticed they were already blinking red. Went ahead and ordered from Invisible fence, even though they are 3x the cost of these they last at least 3x as long and I don't have to worry about my dogs getting out because of a bad battery.",2
58521,"Color DVD worked for a few minutes then went to black and white, poor video quality",2
65253,The warning is pretty scary,2
191859,"Love this! Not only can I travel all day without having to find a way to charge my phone, but it actually makes it a lot easier to handle the phone given the weight and shape. The case also does a great job protecting the phone- I've dropped it at least 5 times since using this case and it's been fine every time! Would definitely recommend.",5
173793,"Expensive but so good it is worth it. Particularly on those nights when you're too tired to rinse your face. This can be wiped off instead of rinsed. I have very sensitive skin and this leaves it soft and without any irritation. I don't even need to use any type of moisturizer when I use this cleanser. You need so little of this, it lasts a very long time; making the price much more reasonable in the long run.",5
193528,"Awesome wallet, my husband loves it. Great fathers day gift.",5
176656,"The color was truly the purple that I desire .. the case arrived as described in excellent condition quickly .. easy to put on the phone and does not interfere with the function, even on the edges.",5

166022,"I wanted to find a large number alarm clock. This isn't a name brand, so I was hesitant to purchase it, but I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. Projection is clear and can be adjusted as needed. This is truly great.",5
160214,I bought this one as a backup as binding tends to wear down. But I have another one like this and I've had four 5 months. Still works great.,5

187013,"This is very pretty, the abalone has good qualities. The chain is as it looks in the picture and is a very strong and attractive chain. This pendant is fairly large, check the measurements. Some things are made to look big and are quite small. This is a decent size.",5

9669,Purchases to try to help my cat. 16 years old with a heart and kidney problem and walking a tight rope right now. She would not eat it and I did not even realize that it was supposed to be refrigerated after you open that. Or a girl that she would not eat it. I contacted the seller asking if I could return the unopened tub since I got two tubs and I believe they made a fair offer to return the money for one tub and help me just throw out the rest of it. So I supposed to get half of the purchase price back. Figured that was fair enough. Problem is when they refunded money they only refunded a quarter of the purchase price instead of half. Not sure if this was a miscommunication. So I am still trying to work on it.,1

19476,These were SO cute and I had planned on putting them in gift bags for my classmates in nursing school for Christmas...however when I opened them they were coated with some sort of oily substance and smelled so strongly of chemicals! I soaked them in hot water and Dawn dish soap and then thoroughly cleaned each and every one of them ...as soon as they dried the smell returned...I threw them in the trash after seeing that the oily residue was even leaving marks on my kitchen table. I don't know what it was but I was very disappointed in this purchase and was completely unable to use the product at all.,1
4599,"I bought these for my rugs going on my carpets. I based my purchase on reviews and I will say, these did not work. Within a day, my carpet was sliding and I don’t even see a point on why I bought them. Don’t waste your money.",1

They are still in otherwise perfect condition and have not experienced any damage whatsoever. Do not purchase these and expect a long lifetime. Sennheiser is also incredibly difficult to work with regarding the warranty. Look elsewhere if you plan on spending this much.",1

153555,"Not very consistent in elastic stretch/size, but very cute!",4
121493,2 reasons for 4 star first is it's too white. That might sound silly but it's even whiter than the face plate it comes with it so white it's extremely noticeable. Second it's really loud it ticks like an old dang clock.,4
129694,Good looking product.,4

If it strays even a half inch in either direction, the collar doesn't detect any barking - even on the highest sensitivity level. I have the collar really tight and it still swivels.
