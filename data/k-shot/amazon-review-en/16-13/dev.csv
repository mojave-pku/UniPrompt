56864,"VERY thin, so be careful. I wear a Large, but ordered an X-Large to be sure since it's 100% cotton, it WILL shrink. Not worth the money. You can get something better at Walmart much cheaper, better quality. Went back the following day it came in for a refund.",2
69311,One of the corners doesn’t light up completely like the others. Not really a great product. Wouldn’t waste money on it again.,2
40478,"The case itself seems fine, but it doesn’t work well with my phone so I need to return it. There was no return label included or option for exchange. This is really frustrating and will mean that I will choose a different product.",2
49027,"Got this a while ago, it worked great for a while. Now it randomly stops playing (freezes). When it does this, the only thing we can do is open the tray, and close it, and hope that it reads the disc right. Which it didn't this last time. While playing a brand new DVD (so no marks or scratches and it plays fine in every other machine in the house). Definitely buying a different brand next time. Oh, and as a side note -- the remote operates on the same frequency as my sound bar, so when I try to turn that up or down, it performs random functions on the DVD player.",2
58060,I paid for a new book and recieved a torn book.,2
58738,I liked this product enough that I bought two so I’d never have to have my phone plugged in. However after 5 months it caught fire after sitting in my car without a phone in it for roughly a hour. As a result my brand new truck caught fire and now stuck with a $500 deductible to fix the damages,2
59327,Thin and sheds like crazy,2
69015,It was too wide to fit in my belt loops. I found way cheaper products that work better and do basically the same thing.,2
77873,I got this to wear when I ride my motorcycle due to the fact I'm still a begginer and to protect my knees if I was to fall however after one use they fell apart on me when I went to put them on for the second time I guess for the price they are terrible but I wish they were a bit more durable,2
63669,"I liked it until it wrapped everything up. The mystery was predictable, and the end of the novel was depressing.",2
55812,These aren’t like those bought from the Streak Free Website. Much cheaper and thinner.,2
52666,If you don't care too much how the print outs look it's ok but there will be ink missing in certain areas and lines won't be straight. They are squiggly lines!!! Don't use it for a resume or anything important. Straight lines are not straight.,2
78610,Looks and feels substantial until start to wash and use. It is not a easy convenient tool. I would not purchase again.,2
54784,"I can't tell you how long it took me to assemble the helmet. I had to put it down on the first try (AFTER my husband tried) because I just didn't have time. It is ridiculously hard to put the two pieces together because there are several connecting points that have to be aligned perfectly before it gets locked in. Because it's a flexible plastic, the points wouldn't stay aligned and it took considerable strength to push the parts together to lock in, once they were aligned. It was so frustrating. The helmet was one reason we chose this costume for a school presentation. And it was a hit, I will say that but it was so frustrating to assemble and I'm just glad I had the time to sit down with it. The jumper was fine but it is see-through. So be prepared to wear something underneath. My son wore skinny jeans and a T-shirt underneath.",2
79303,doesent cut very well doesent seem to be too sharp,2
54206,Only the pink one actually charged my phone...so far...waste of money for only one to work,2
193237,Works fine with my ps4. I like the fact that it is gold-plated with a price similar to ones that aren't. Seems to be of very solid build quality.,5
183554,"I love these headphones!!!! The noise cancelling is amazing, a must have when flying. Great for blocking out background noise, totally saved my flight when a crying baby was on the plane. Sound is great, clear highs and strong bass... all in balance. The bluetooth connection is very stable. The microphone in the headphones is extremely sensitive and can be a bit much when using for phone calls. The battery life is astounding... charge it up before a business trip and I dont have to worry about it until I get home. Worth every penny!!!!",5
196710,Great gift for teachers,5
189688,This is the second set that I've purchased because I was very pleased with the first set. They are made of a great fabric and fit the way a fitted sheet should fit. I highly recommend them to others.,5
165648,"Keeps my 30yr old looking great, this is the only thing that worked for him. He lost a lot of weight through the winter, within 2 months he looked amazing. He is a extremely picky eater, and he licks his bucket clean every time.",5
181328,I love these sheets. They are a beautiful color and so soft and fit my bed perfectly without wrinkles and bunching. Would buy again in a heartbeat. I truly love them so much.,5
190600,fixed our dryer was easy to install fit good,5
178446,"This cream, used right after washing my face or showering and before bed, holds the moisture in. It works for me.",5

167470,Perfect and accurate. Right on with my Doctors.,5
173477,These bags are exactly what I was hoping for. I love the variety of colors and match perfectly to some new ribbon that I purchased. They are very sturdy and quality bags. They will work perfectly for the gifts I'm giving to my fellow employees.,5

33058,these cords are great looking however both broke within two weeks. Now I have two crappy broken pretty but worthless chords. Crap... back to the original short apple charger that has worked beautifully for 2 years!,1
11507,Watch doesn't function right. Lps partners won't honor warranty. Don't buy from them.,1
26361,This cracked immediately after applying to my phone,1
22945,This swing sliced into the side of my finger as I picked up my one year old. The metal was cut and left raw and sharp inside the swing. It’s a deep cut! The metal should be rounded off. I’m glad it happened to me and not my wiggly one year old.,1
25932,"The worst! It was my baby boy’s 2nd birthday and he loves the hulk, he opened it and right away I could tell it was cheaply made , the plastic material is extremely thin, about an hour later my baby boy fell holding this toy , and they toy broke the arm fell off, my son was extremely sad , I would not buy this toy again . It didn’t even last an hour!!!!!",1
21176,The rice maker sent was USED!??!? It had large dents and scratches all over it. There was still water marks from when it was used before. EWW!,1
24223,I didn't order this one,1
18125,Came broken. Shipping was so fast and packaging looks great! So I was surprised to open the box and right away spot the broken product. Total bummer as my daughter was really looking forward to using this for her rabbits.,1
4113,Heavy and extremely uncomfortable bike. Not worth the $. Wish I could return it.,1
6531,This came with the safety seal punctured. I can’t use it so one star.,1
2115,The thing came looking like a whole rat. I'm not joking this thing looked like some sort of matted dog! D I S G U S T I N G!,1
10679,"I purchased this for my niece, but the pink unicorn is completely deformed. The face and body is all smashed up. Disappointed because this was part of my niece's Christmas gift.",1
19864,"This labels are awful! I get a paper jam most of the time and waste them, does not happen with any of the labels I have bought on Amazon before.",1
6829,"Each chapter has less than a page of explanation about the topic. Seen as the test is very unique about the way it asks some concepts, the small explanations don't help at all. Also, it spends little time trying to just explain how to do it in the calculator but I found those explanations not helpful at all for what it asks you to do in the practice problems. Really disappointing considering the other SAT books by this brand. Do not recommend it for anyone who does not have a good understanding of math and the test already.",1
139852,"I ordered a size up and it fits perfectly, not too tight. But it did arrive with the tag sewn on the front of the dress.",4
121449,No additions. Just the stitching. Really cool. Like a great deal.,4
144257,i use it for calculus homework. it's good for the online homework. i work out the math then enter the answer online and erase after submitting the answer and reviewing if necessary.,4
131530,The table itself is exactly what you would hope for but one small problem the black paint on the sides seems to peel off quite easily not very noticeable but the only thing preventing this table from being a 5 star!,4
143929,Really cute design on this keychain alarm. Purchased for my daughter's 75 year old great grandma. She is still active and independent and because I purchased a different set for my daughter I thought of her safety as well. I didn't personally try the alarm as this was a gift but my daughter and her nana did and said it was loud.,4
138328,"Cute and soft. Purchased at $20, a bit overpriced.",4
136007,"When I bought this set I was aware that they were going to be heavier than a nylon utensil but I wanted the extra protection it gives to my pots. It is heavier for sure, but easy to get used to. Great quality.",4
147242,"She did not come looking as nice as the photos show, which was why I gave it 4 starts because I had to purchase makeup to make her look decent. Not sure why her head is so yellow and she has skimpy brows but I was able to fix it with makeup. I pierced her ears and changed her lips and also gave her some brows. You could also use her without the head but I needed it so I put the work in. She is sturdy for the most part. She is a good buy especially if you are good with makeup.",4
133417,"so far I'm not unhappy, I have found some devices it will not work with.",4
139979,"These socks are great fabric and look well made, but they are HUGE! They come up to my daughter's thighs. We fold them down, so it's not a huge deal. I was just surprised at how long they are.",4
122771,"I like the customization of all the buttons. Drawing pressure makes a difference, nice fluidity. Froze a couple of times when I drew close to the edge of the drawing area, had to unplug and plug back in.",4
126122,"I use this projector as a home video projector. I use it in place of a tv. While it does come with speakers, they were very tin sounding and gave me a headache. Instead, I ordered separate $20 computer monitor speakers and the combination work great. This projector did have a wear frame skipping thing going on with one of my laptops though because the FPS match was 1 off. My projector runs at 59 FPS which I cannot change anywhere. I have to use a separate laptop and change my laptop’s core settings to be flexible with this and to force it to stream up to 59 FPS. Other than that, the picture is good, focuses well, the planing is good, nothing else to note!",4
158089,Perfect fit summer nights where u just went to leave the window open and no mosquitoes biting at you,4
137359,"It’s a very heavy duty product. I was looking for an extension cord which is flexible as I have lot of power cords which take lot of space when powered in. This is a very smart device as each single station can be rotated and it can accommodate large power cords too easily. Another cool feature is USB adaptor which can be used to charge phone directly. There are two limitations with the product though 1) as I understand from using it, it does not has over charge protection 2) the max current combined of the USB port is 2.1 A which is kind of less if both the USB stations are in use",4
120219,Absolutely love the crackers the flavor if you’re doing low-carb I give them a thumbs up. The downside is they are very costly for a cracker and I wish I could buy them somewhere and not have them shipped because they arrive mostly broken up. I had a hard time finding one whole cracker in the bay,4
136912,Not that easy to program but it's sturdy,4
112986,Over priced for what it is.,3
83687,This case was good for the first two weeks until the whole rim around the case came off. I recommend this case if you have a back up case also the case gets lots of scratches.,3
80358,Appearance. Not packaged well honey all over the outside of the package. Product fell out of the cardboard when I picked it up. Seems awfully thin for honey.,3
102300,"It looks nice. But it took so long for shipping, and its corner is broken.",3
102523,This is my second order but this time I got a lot of liquid instead mineral from the container when use. Did anyone have the same experience? Is it a bad batch?,3
86662,"I was bummed he two tracks didn’t fit together. Be aware that here are he light up tracks as well as other normal tracks, but the two do not work together. I prefer the normal tracks over the light up. They’re more pliable and easier to put together.",3
104263,Nice looking case. It fits well on my phone. Not sure how well it will hold up. It’s a little too slippery for me.,3
113634,"Meh. It works, you get what you pay for.",3
113361,"The lock itself is perfect for my needs, but the mounting bracket is a true disappointment. I had to tighten the mounting screw on every ride, and it is absolutely annoying. In this price range this problem should to eliminated. Now i have to use an extra velcro strap to fix the wobble and keep the lock in the desired position.",3
107010,Not the picture shown. The pic was supposed to be vertically oriented ... and a different photo. What I rec’d is an OK pic but I needed a vertically oriented pic for the place I wanted to hang it. Disappointed.,3
92534,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE PRODUCT - NOT THE SELLER. SELLER IS GREAT! This MIGHT be a good product, I purchased it because I thought curcumin would be a good thing to take. However, when I opened the bottle it was SMURF blue! The manufacturer felt the need to add FD&C Blue #1 to the product. First - WHY; and second, if you're adding a DYE, why BLUE? Isn't curcumin orange/yellow? I strongly feel that if it is not necessary to the quality or performance of the product - keep it as pure as possible. I've got to think (and I'll research this) that the DYE is not dangerous, but I question the necessity to add it at all... Not sure if I'm keeping it or not - was just VERY surprised when I opened the bottle!",3
109393,"I'll keep the hat, but it's not what I expected or really wanted. The body of the hat is, indeed, unstructured but the brim is not in the least soft. Instead, it is a stiff material which is sewn in three separate pieces so that the bill can be folded.",3
104505,I thought I ordered it for a IPhone.,3
89520,"If you have to use the extensions, they are worthless. They are so flimsy my puppy had figured he can push hard enough and break through. If you don’t need those it’s perfect .",3
111425,"The construction seems decent, laser works, good ease of use, however I'm not sure how accurate this is. You can turn the bullet a tad and the laser will point slightly differently. It is not perfectly aligned with your barrel, so at 25 yards can be pretty off.",3
109514,"I realize that when you make a forecast you may be wrong,however I watch weather news to see what they think will happen. So far this channel seems very timid in the forecast department. Geez take a chance.",3
