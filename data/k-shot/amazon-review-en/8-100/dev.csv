170538,Got these for my kid's phones for Christmas. They have held up great. They are not flimsy. They seem like they have great shock absorption and I like how well they grip in your hand. Great product for the price.,5
171346,I have had 3 kids and hysterectomy. I have been having issues lately. I have just started using. I hope they work. They are comfortable and easy to use. They clean easily. I worth the money . Remote is fun.,5
196593,Very nice design. You were also pretty easy to use,5
163933,I got the band for my wife she has a smaller wrist so I got the smaller size. It‚Äôs fits great and she loves it,5
161786,"This is an awesome uke stand! I teach public school and have to keep mine separate from the rest of the class, this holds it perfectly and it‚Äôs very sturdy. Don‚Äôt hesitate to purchase!",5
178838,These were great for mounting handguns and tools or anything else you want to hang up or conceal. Durable rubber coating prevents your items from being scratched. Works as advertised,5
180221,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. It was a big update for her gaming rig and really improved her graphics! She said she noticed a big difference. It's been very reliable so far for many weeks of Skyrim (and other gaming).,5
195331,More in the head and less in the shower floor and drainage. I like that this product comes through for me. I have tried a couple other products before but I have never been this content with just a single one. I would absolutely recommend this.,5
36816,hard to take my printer to the repair shop after using this replacement brand,1
22705,"I have ordered this product three times. The first time I got my product as ordered. The second and third time the shipper only sent one box even though they were supposed to send two. I can understand making the mistake once, but to do the same mistake twice is a pity and a shame. I would leave 5 stars for the actual boxes, and 0 stars for the person in shipping who needs reading glasses.",1
30399,The hair brush came with strands of hair in it already!!! Why would I pay for it brand new but get a used set.,1
9733,In December I purchased two LxTek five pack 952XL in anticipation of a planned distribution for a small nonprofit mission group that i work with. After some delay the printed project got underway. When printing began I discovered that only one out of the four 952XL black cartridge was functional. A 75% failure rate is much too high for any product. Unfortunately due to the delays in the project my time for recourse through Amazon Prime also passed. I love the idea of reused/re-manufactured cartridges but there should be some checks on re-usability before marketing.,1
16382,"Bought in October...Burned up in January. The blender worked great....until it didn't. It was used once a day from October to January. Each morning, I made a Rocket-Fuel Latte. No ice, no nuts, nothing dense. One morning, it began to make funny noises, the blender slowed down, and as I turned it off, it began to smoke and produce a very odd smell. Braun customer service seems to be set up to deny claims. I still don't have a new blender-- they only want to give me the bottom part, but the things that turn the blades are locked up, too. Still in limbo using a cheap blender from WalMart.",1
27295,Do not purchase does not stick to iwatch,1
37717,Never received the item not sure who is to blame USPS or Amazon ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Short $60 and USPS doesn‚Äôt care where they dropped it off... waiting on amazon at this point.,1
7844,"The proportions are all wrong. I was hoping for a quality product, very disappointed. I will never waste my money to purchase this product again.",1
61317,Not sweet enough in my opinion. Definitely can be better,2
54712,Used 2 times and broke,2
43244,"Easy to assemble and beautiful on the eye. But not very comfy to seat on. My bottom sweats wet since the material is synthetic. Very disappointed:( can‚Äôt return unfortunately, since threw away the package already and this is not an amazon prime...:(",2
63480,"The blue pencil leaks and goes everywhere. The white pencil doesn‚Äôt show easily. It is not worth, sorry.",2
77059,It did not live up to my expectations very small and very difficult to put on,2
50373,They don't work really well,2
46922,"I was so excited to find a dairy free bunny for my daughter. I read other reviews and made sure I was getting it as soon as it was delivered, so it wouldn't melt. But he came broken into three parts. Bummer.",2
70454,"I'd love to say that this is a great faucet, and for about 6 months it was. Unfortunately, the faucet head has now failed twice and the replacement took over a month to arrive, leaving me with a barely functional faucet. For a $80 faucet, I might put up with it but this is expensive and frankly pretty poorly engineered.",2
137589,"well done, worth watching",4
131184,We have been looking for shower sandals like these for awhile. In stores they are more expensive but I found these on Amazon and he is very happy with them.,4
153591,"So far so good. I bought this to attach to my pack and play for my twins. Definitely does the job. It has 3 modes: on, off, on no music. I gave 4 stars because it must be attached to a hard part of the pack and play. If I try to tighten it on the fabric side, it cannot grip with the weight of the mobile causing it to hang down wayyy to close to baby. Not really a big deal, works fine if you attach to hard area.",4
121657,"These are nice sheets, They washed well and didn't really look wrinkled after drying but they do wrinkle once used on the bed like most other sheets. Still a nice set they are soft and have a nice feel to them. They fit my foam mattress good without slipping off. Would recommend.",4
142611,I LOVED how easy it was to put this together. Usually my husband and I cannot be in the same room after we put furniture together this was a breeze. The only problem was that the king size frame was just a tad to small for the mattress so we just put the little part that doesn't fit at the head so it's not as noticable.,4
136987,"Functional, great price. However, it would be helpful to visualize the files in thumbnails or small photos. I hope you may improve this feature in the future.",4
148230,"It is a great toy and definitely gets the job done. The material is top notch and allows you to control the level of suction. The only reason I gave it 4 starts is because the massage pattern inside could be better. Wish it had more patterns available, like they do for their other products. However, it is great for the price. (Easy clean up, my girlfriend loves that).",4
133995,Our dog loves this! Easy to refill too.,4
118793,"After the first day, the chair is SQUEAKY. Also, the screws on the back dont line up with the chair, the screw ended up crimping the plastic.",3
82357,"I've enjoyed buying the Sierra Club wall calendar for decades. This year was no different - stunning pictures, great size for jotting in appointments and reminders, and a good way to show support for the Club's work keeping the most beautiful parts of our country intact and available for public awe and recreation. And what a good thing I was ordering it for myself, rather than as a Christmas gift, since it arrived with crushed corners and there would not likely be time to return it and take a risk on another one.",3
85212,"Where to start ?:... it took about a month to ship, which really sucked. Once it arrived the package was very flimsy and not very protective also not discreet at all!!! It said TOY in all caps right on the package . The instructions were in Chinese but it did have separate ones In English but very small print ! So small I had to use a magnifying glass just to read them. Works how advertised but I couldn‚Äôt get the remote (which was bigger than I expected) to work until I charged everything fully for a few hours, i does have an indicator light and flashes while charging , I had to sorta plug the dc cable in just right and move it around so that I could make full contact in order for it the charge ( took me about a day to get this thing fully charged ) . Very soft and smooth texture , The head swivels in a circular motion which I didn‚Äôt even know it did, but not to be too graphic it just isn‚Äôt strong enough to do that while it‚Äôs in use , not a very powerful vibration either but it is quiet . It was an ok buy .",3
82218,"Love merrells but so disappointed in color, they look nothing like picture. Also, 2 day shipping took 6 days",3
81532,"These turtles were good, but no better than the ones that you can get in the store for a lot less. They do NOT have real Tortuga Rum in them. It is artificial rum flavor... and it TASTES artificial too.",3
111314,"If you are using a console, and if you have a microphone headset, you need the cable. however those cables are so cheaply made that after a week it would no longer show mic or game volume is being put onto the pc. The software is a bit weird as well but it isn't really clunky.",3
