199658,"I purchased this tracker due to my daughter being a new driver and concerns about her safety. It took seconds to install and I am not a tech wiz. I dowloaded the app to my phone and can also track using my laptop. Within minutes from installation, the tracker synced with the app and I was able to track her car. It allows me to see her speed, received notifications if there is sharp turning or braking, and also provides a history of where she has been. I can get exact coordinates of her location and times which has already come in handy in a big way. We received a call from the police department that there was an accident and the person who was driving hit another vehicle and drove away. The vehicle was similar to my daughter's and she was in the same town when the accident occurred! I was able to pull up the tracking history and see she was not in the same location where the accident occurred at that time through the tracker. Also, her vehicle did not show any damage thankfully. The tracker saved us a lot of hassle and concern. PS She is unaware the tracker is on her vehicle. If for some reason it is removed, we would be notified as well as the unit will send a message that it has been tampered with. Overall, very pleased with this product.",5

77027,"After researching all vanity tables, I decided to go with this one for its price and dimensions. It’s cute, and I would definitely give it 4-5 stars, but the smell is horrible! We assembled it 4 days ago, and the room still smells like toxic paint or something. The minute my boyfriend opened the box, my yes started tearing up. I really wish we hadn’t assembled it already.",2

58169,"This is usually my favorite brand! These are very cute and comfortable, but the first pair broke in a few hours of wearing them at work. (I have a desk job) I was sent a replacement pair, but I've been afraid to wear them, as I don't want the same thing to happen. 🤞 Update - I've changed my rating to 2 stars, as the replacement pair have broken as well. They lasted 2 days. Very disappointed.",2
60188,Order at least one size up. Material is cheap. Stiff and you can't take photos or type emails as advertised.,2
65554,I hate to review anything especially when I have received it a few hours back. Two stars because the packaging is either very poor or I have received an open package. That too one day later than what was promised.,2
48149,"These are HUGE! My 2 1/2 year old wears an 8, but they are fitting snug. I ordered a size 9 (double checked their size chart), and they are HUGE. See pics for comparison (you can see the 8 and 9 imprinted on each shoe).",2

84606,"3/5 this book lacks structure, world building and a real plot. It's starts real slow and nothing really happens until you are 70% in. Definitely over hyped and doesn't live up to it. Much room for improvement on book 2.",3
97283,"The case is easy enough to install. The screen protector is not. It has a blacked out border for some reason. If you don't line it up perfectly it may obscure your front camera. The touch screen is also less responsive to your touch, especially around the edges. I would recommend purchasing a screen protector from someone else.",3
103912,"I love frankincense. It's my favorite incense. This is not the frankincense you have smelled in churches or other rituals. It smells generically sweet and flowery. Not at all like the musty, smokey scent I am used to. The scent isn't bad, and it's dirt cheap, but you will be disappointed if you are looking for the scent of actual frankincense resin.",3
