Turned on the light for no more than a minute or two for the first time, came back the next morning, batteries were dead! Put 3 more new cheap batteries in, same symptoms, worked for the first 2 times then dead. Went and bought the Ever Ready Duracell batteries, the top of the line AAA batteries. Same symptoms! Very frustrated and very unhappy with the product. It seems to have a battery draw even with the light off. I use it now without the light. Thought about returning it for a refund or perhaps an exchange, but the directions and the language used on the box is French. Be careful not to leave the suction cup stand on the wall too long, because it will lose suction and fall.

51880,"The two fasteners that secure the buckle on this belt are glued together. The back side has a flathead screwdriver slot, but the front end is just a smooth surface (ostensibly to eliminate any friction when buckling). However, since there is no way to grip the smooth front side, it’s impossible to break the glue lock and unscrew the pieces without damaging the belt. The comments tell you to grip the smooth front end with needle-nose pliers and then warns you to be careful not to damage the belt. But since that part is flush with the belt surface, the only way to grip it with needle-nose pliers is to dig into the leather to get the pliers around it. Some damage is almost assured if you do this. Poor design on an otherwise high quality belt. They could easily make the smooth front end with a flathead screwdriver slot just deep enough to get purchase to crack the glue. Then you'd just need two screwdrivers and no damage would occur.

Having more than just two height setting would address this issue. The seat is wider side to side than it is front to back. The reduced depth gave me the sense I was sitting on 1/2 a chair rather than a full one.

I have only seen it in the Russian with English subtitles, but it is worth the time to watch. As someone who is frequently watching subbed work this film does an amazing job of allowing the emotion to be portrayed even in the subs and is able to make it an easy pace to follow even with slower readers. The story is one that anyone can relate too. The pains of growing older, discovering new truths about yourself and others, understanding and accepting the differences in us, standing up for you heart and what you believe in and it even manages to add in sibling understanding in to its plot. The CGI is also really good and makes the mystical creatures come alive.

It had a ton of itty bitty pockets that I didn't need (like, pockets big enough for 1 baby sock kind of small) and it was bulky and took up a lot of space under the stroller or in a shopping cart. I hated it. Enter this bag. It's so lightweight but DURABLE. It's been tossed around, thrown in the back of the trunk, and it's still going.

Stepped on one and it broke right off the bat. Def couldn’t hold 300 lbs, not even 200! Also, it never felt like it really locked in place.",1

36026,I am truly shocked that All-Clad has put their name on this product as their pots and pans are of excellent quality. The lids do not properly match the ceramic inserts which allows for heat to escape during the cooking process. The result is that food may not be cooked as expected. This situation occurred with the original order and also replacement order. Shame on me for not reading reviews before purchasing or I would have known about the potential problem.,1

16358,"I loved the colors but was extremely disappointed to find two holes in the butt after only one wear during which I was sitting on soft upholstered furniture, most of the time around my house. There should not be holes in them after such gentle wear. I won't be buying from this brand ever again. If i wanted to throw money away I'm sure I'd find less disappointment if I just threw it out of my car window.",1

132007,"Bought this set as a great deal for special event decoration. Length of one was sufficient to string along three, 8 foot table lengths (end-to-end). Appreciate that these are battery operated and have a choice of programs. Hubby was even impressed that the battery casings looks to be safe enough for outdoor use. Perfect for lowlight indoor table settings, lit backgrounds, garden lighting (YMMV) and kids' room decor.",4

122610,The instructions were solid until the top of the closet. Then they were lacking a way that made understanding the process ridiculously challenging.,4
121474,"Exactly as expected, maybe better.",4
150267,Definitely worth the price. Instructions are very vague but any do it yourselfer can figure it out. Had to use a thread chaser on one of the bolt holes but no big deal.,4

141936,"This is a very detailed, thorough, and truly global treatise on the Great War. Keegan has painstakingly researched and cross-reference this work. As you read you are at one moment seeing the politics and war plans as from a great height, and the next you are hearing the words of men muddied and bloody in the trenches. While one can certainly sense this is written from the eyes and mind of an Englishman, Keegan does justice to the experiences of French, German, Russian, and the large myriad of other nationalities who participated in this disastrous conflict. Well done.",4
148479,"Very firm, but does help with arch support.",4
146252,"Just installed this. I'll concur with others; the knockouts at the bottom are more like faint scoring. Better to use a hole saw or Dremel to get the job done. Another weakness to the product for me were the terminal connections inside the box. The terminals were really too small and cheap feeling, in my opinion, especially if you're going to attach a pool motor or 20 A load. If you properly wire those, you'll find the necessary wire gauge is a tight fit.",4
125691,"I like how Kelly used a lot of Scripture in order to help us transform our mind which is exactly what God tells us to do. I especially liked thinking about how I am not God's co-worker even though that sounds good on the surface. Instead, I am God's daughter. I really meditated on that part and it was so freeing since I'm in a busy time right now where I have been living like I needed to do everything in ministry perfectly for God to love me. The one thing I wish was different is that I wish this was printed like a workbook. That is how Kelly intended this book to be used, but it wasn't published that way. I thought it was going to be more reading than it was. Instead it was kind of like reading a lot of blog posts and homework assignments all at once. So if you are looking for a Bible study on the topic, this is a good one.",4

122090,"Good pair of sticks, it's like a longer 2B",4
150251,I love this. My favorite part is that the pad has perforated edges between the grocery list and the menu so that the menu can stay on the fridge and the list can go to the market.,4
126141,Works as intended - in my case - using it strictly as a archive device - thus it's not plugged in all the time - I plug it up - do my archiving & then disco it ... no issues ...,4
131087,"This thing was AWESOME.... until it stopped working a few days later. I used it a lot, but then one of the pads stopped functioning. Had to return it, but customer service was awesome and sent me a brand new one. So far, no problems and great with pain management! Highly recommend!",4

149425,Story was amazing. Ending could have gotten there much sooner.,4
139453,My first impression I have is they are very stiff. The synthetic soles seems to be very aggressive for basically an everyday walking shoe. They have ridges that look like they will fail after a short period walking on hard surfaces. When I put them on they fit very well. They are stiff but will hopefully loosen up after wearing for awhile. I wish the sole was rubber. My biggest concern will be the durability of the sole. I think they will be nice shoes. Time will tell.,4
145960,Liked the package but would have liked napkins to be lol also they were pink,4
141895,Organic and reasonable. Roasting is well done. Bean quality is very good.,4
151734,I do like the soft silk material and it keeps light out sufficiently. I don’t like that this mask goes all the way to my hairline which makes forehead sweat and break out. I also don’t care for the adjustable part of the band as I can feel the plastic against the back of my head at times. I had the previous version of this mask and it was narrower on my face which I liked but the elastic band stretched out after a year. I’ll wear it but also keep looking for one a little smaller.,4
158491,"The oil is lighter than others and easy to work in, which is a big plus. Decent brush and comb set. The brush hairs don't just fall out after a single use. Overall, a good product for the price.",4
152295,Worked as expected. Every now and then a black blip on screen prevented from giving 5 stars,4
156871,"This thing is rugged and works well. I do wish that it came with bolts and wingnuts for mounting but I get that they can't know the thickness of what you're mounting it too, but a good guess would have been real nice.",4

153441,4 star playing tray. Works well for its functions. Fairly easy to set up and your child can use it as they please. They can use it to draw or they can use it as a table to put food on or other toys to play with. Only negative is it doesn't have an adjustable height for larger kids.,4
122751,"Great product, wires and adapter are sturdy. Wires are together which avoids tangling. Only wish they were longer (to use on other batteries / machinery).",4

124368,convenient for the minis...but quite a bit flimsy...but then again...it is silicone,4
142381,My massage clients like the extra padding this provides on the head rest. I wish it was slightly bigger so it would fit the head rest better.,4
129848,"This fit very well, on my Brinkmann fairly well, though it is a little tight. Even though it is a 72 inch cover and my grill is a 72 inch grill, the cover could use a little slack on the ends so I don't have to worry about the sharp edges ripping my grill cover. The material feels very strong, but several repeats of putting it on and off I expect there to be some fabric wear in the corners of the grill cover because of how snug it was over my grill. There are little loops and clips for attaching it underneath the grill so if you are planning on long term storage it is really great!",4

141298,"made from good quality , lots of space inside for put in more stuff",4
135458,"I like the product. Takes a but of time to fine tune but I like all of the options for alerts and protection. My main issue is with the app and Bluetooth. It's Bluetooth range isn't great (must be in same room)... Also, the app lacks watts in or out and only shows Amps. Lacks any kind of performance charts or graphs. Just shows last DoD, Average DoD, Deepest DoD, Total Watts Discharged vs Charged (weird that they convert that to watts but not live Amps to Watts...), Lowest vs Highest Battery Voltage, and a few other things. Some charting would help with battery health tracking. All in all, it's a decent BMS, my favorite feature is the estimated time you can run whatever load till whatever custom DoD% you choose is reached.",4

87038,"Difficult to turn on and off; button is tiny and not easy to reach. Since each control button has more than one function depending on degree of pressure, I have a difficult time navigating with old fingers. I frequently lock it and am unable to unlock. The screen is easy to read",3
87514,I havent used it for it's intention. I tested it and I'm having issues for lack of knowledge. Night vision isn't very clear and the sound is great considering it's size. I'm worried about it now because a friend brought to my attention hacking might give criminals entry into my privacy. Yikes!,3
89560,"It fits a bit big, very comfortable material though!",3
116737,I disliked that the rod was placed way too close to the front so hangers stick out which is a total disaster for the eyes now I have to live with this since I can’t afford another shelf smh,3

112136,"Are these reviews real? Easy to cook in? What are you talking about...this is a faucet, and a lousy one at that. Easy to install, but the photos are incredibly misleading. You need at least 2-3 inches of clearance behind the facuet to put the handle all the way back. Had to install it offset to compensate. Operation is cumbersome, although maybe it's common with these types of designs that make them a pain to rotate freely and reset back into the holder. The 360 degree rotation could be true but good luck not pulling a muscle trying to move it. Could loosen up in time but not going to struggle with it find out. Finish is nice and appears well built, but the functionality is questionable.",3

90541,"I just received this product it was a quick delivery and very anxious to use it. as soon as opened the package I could see that the bottle was cracked 😭 and when I opened it, is wasn't even halfway full hmmm ☹️ very dissapointed 😩 for the price and the size of the container makes you think is at least more than half way full.

96903,"The table is beautiful and very sturdy. Only problem is that the canvas drawers take up knee space, so my (very small) four year old doesn't fit comfortably. We will end up taking the drawers off and coming up with a different solution for Lego storage. Definitely a bummer, but it's a nice table otherwise. Oh and the reversible top is very heavy to flip. I don't mind that, though.",3
96982,I wish I had gotten classic instead of applewood smoked. It is a little too sweet and the flavor profile is vastly less versatile. I got it to add to pulled bbq jackfruit and really can’t imagine using it for anything else besides bbq dishes. The sweetness of it also tastes a little synthetic so all around not too pleased.,3

109608,"Yeah, the purple controller I got seems to have directional problems. The black one seems to be okay for Smash Bros, but the purple control definitely not sufficient.",3
106567,"The band is very attractive and comfortable with my Charge 2. You must factor into the cost that it will last less than 3 months before the finish wears and becomes worn, black and unattractive.",3
92793,"Well written book, though content didn't get me as excited as I thought. A huge chunk of the book was on race and gender. I thought it overpowered the book, but I understand this is her reality. For reference, I am a black woman also, so I can relate. Overall, didn't agree with her approach to sex, relationships, and finances in relationships. If anything, the book makes me appreciate how different individuals are, how different our childhood and backgrounds are, and how that shapes us. Still love me some Gabrielle Union :)",3

88584,"Really love the design of these sheets! I've had them for about two months now and some seams are already coming undone, which is a bummer. Wish they were a tad bit softer, but overall I'm still happy with purchase. The print is definitely my favorite part about them.",3

Wasnt able to glue back together with gorilla glue, hot glue might work(i dont have). i ended up just removed the string and the elastic parts and wrapping it around my door knob, going to find a way to put it on a wall or door again. Its pretty high up, my nearly full grown cat has to jump to get it which is good and bad. Better exercise, but will hurt her joints in the long run. Dont get this if you have a small kitten or a super lazy fat cat. I doubt they will jump to play with it, but you CAN modify it and extend the string if you wish to do so.",3

To be fair there are a few which are somewhat strong such as peppermint, spearmint, lemon, and a few others but many are weak or unpleasant. Makes a good set to use by mixing with other, higher quality oils thus creating your own custom scents.",3

115783,"I bought this ac about a month ago and it has been working great until today, the hottest day of the year. I have the ac turned on ac mode and the fan turned up. The hose is installed right, not bent or obstructed. I set the temp down to 70. I cleaned the filters and emptied the water. But ac still only comes on for at most 2 min then there is a thump noise and it turns off leaving only the fan going. Then after about 5 min the ac comes on then turns off again. It's been doing this for the last hour and I don't know what to do. I'm miserable and hot and drenched in sweat. It's 98 degrees out at the moment. I've tried everything I can think of. I thought maybe it has overheated so I turned it off for half an hour but made no difference. I can't afford a new ac already but it's looking like I'm going to have to buy one. I'm updating my review the day after I posted it. As soon as the outdoor temperature started going down the unit was able to stay on for longer periods of time. As soon as it was back in the 80s instead of hovering around 100 I stopped having problems and the unit has worked fine since. I assume it was just to much for it to cool the space it previously had no trouble with once it became dangerously hot out. I don't expect many more days that hot but am going ahead and getting a second unit of some type just in case. I changed my rating from 1 to 3 stars.",3
97629,"I gave this 3 stars because it had everything I needed in a starter kit and the price was fair for that purpose but I was very disappointed. The mat, which I assume would be the most important part of a Yoga package, is extremely light, flimsy, and rolls up at edges no matter which side it is turned on. Also has bad grip and slides around with the slightest movement. Unfortunately, I purchased 2 starter kits right off the bat (1 as a gift) because of the high ratings I saw for this product. I would be able to use the towels and the bag but the mats will have to be replaced.",3
85854,Sizing ran small. The lettering is some kind of heat transfer. Wife ended up giving it away,3
110050,"Quick delivery. However, the book cover is bent as though it had sat horizontal with a large weight pressing it unevenly. The package was in perfect condition, leading me to believe that the seller shipped it that way.",3
100311,"Product is as described, however i havent tested the product yet",3
93994,"Works as advertised, water has a mild orange taste, like the old baby aspirins. Problem is the cup is tiny. You pretty much need to keep a bigger glass or a pitcher and refill this cup after every drink.",3
86682,This is just ok. There really is not enough weight to it to keep it securely in place against the bottom of the door. Had I not taken the packaging off I would’ve returned it to find something better.,3
83955,I like it talks about different aspects. I do not like that are general statements and not specifically month by month.,3
86381,"Cheap price, cheap quality. Not great value. Get the Red Cross Brand. These are thin and may require more of them to do the job depending on what you use them for. Not goot value.",3
91303,It was great for six months until now that the zipper broke and can’t be fixed.,3
112517,"After measuring myself, I ordered the largest socks you sell. I could hardly get them on my foot. So I have returned them. Is it possible I didn’t order the largest sock you sell? The many colors are fun and I wish I could wear them.",3
116539,"I bought it as a gift for my husband he loves the the look but, it sometimes comes unclamped.It has fallen out several times and he wasn’t aware of it.",3
109426,"Love this product, but they have GOT to do something about the release tab on the belt clip breaking so easily. Speaking of, maybe offer the belt clip for sale as a solo item?",3
81429,Very fragile and difficult to get the battery pack in the middle. Could not even put one on the front spokes are too narrow for the battery pack to fit through.,3
85780,Works for my old mac laptop but gets pretty hot.,3
85960,Very nice looking set. Some fading after wash.,3
82456,I purchased this for my dad on his birthday. To be honest the hilt is way too sleek and slippery to be functional. While I recommend the KA-BAR I do not recommend this version for field use. This is more of a show knife to be mounted. Go with the tactical version with an actual grip if you plan on using it.,3
110742,Good beginning for prep. Somewhat repetitive. The links noted were helpful.,3
108974,We gave 3 stars because it was a prime product that took over 7 days to arrive,3
