55460,"First off, this took weeks to get here. I didn't realize it was shipping from China or I would have paid a few bucks extra and gotten one that was Prime. I don't hold that against the seller it's just that I didn't realize that when I bought it. The actual product is kind of crap. I tested the first 3 keychains, #1 worked just fine and is on my car keys. #2 didn't work at all, and #3 works some of the time (I have it velcro'd to my Fire remote). I thought at first maybe the receiver just doesn't work through walls (even though the transmitter was about 10 feet away)- but the keychain transmitter was able to ping in the exact same location so it's just a faulty transmitter. It does ping sometimes - but every time it has been after I'd already found the dang thing and brought it close to the transmitter to test that it was working at all. Defeats the point! I'm really disappointed in this product and based on 2 out of 6 (again, I didn't test the other 3 so it might be a higher %) not functioning as they should I'd say give this particular product a pass. One of the tested transmitters DID work and works well, so it's not a 1 star - maybe I just got an old/bad set.",2
46956,Didn’t notice anything.,2
65690,Some of these waterers are just too large at the bottom & the water just guzzles out. I’ve had others that work much better.,2

50365,"Kind of ok, I tried it once haven't again, all I can say. Wasn't anything like what the reviews I read!",2

43311,Did not do as stated. Overall very disappointed,2
53966,product material and style is perfect but is sizing is not perfect,2
43942,My puppy has shown little interest in this toy and it was smaller than expected. I would recommend for super small/young puppies. Not for medium puppies over 10 weeks old.,2
44691,While I really appreciated the fine mesh on this. After a couple months of semi regular use the spot welds that hold the arms on fell apart. Booo...,2
44934,Three months later and the heel fell off completely in middle of school.,2
71227,"Not sure whether they are old stock or just cheap cells, but the batteries Didn't even last a month before I noticed they were already blinking red. Went ahead and ordered from Invisible fence, even though they are 3x the cost of these they last at least 3x as long and I don't have to worry about my dogs getting out because of a bad battery.",2
58521,"Color DVD worked for a few minutes then went to black and white, poor video quality",2
65253,The warning is pretty scary,2
56864,"VERY thin, so be careful. I wear a Large, but ordered an X-Large to be sure since it's 100% cotton, it WILL shrink. Not worth the money. You can get something better at Walmart much cheaper, better quality. Went back the following day it came in for a refund.",2
69311,One of the corners doesn’t light up completely like the others. Not really a great product. Wouldn’t waste money on it again.,2
40478,"The case itself seems fine, but it doesn’t work well with my phone so I need to return it. There was no return label included or option for exchange. This is really frustrating and will mean that I will choose a different product.",2
49027,"Got this a while ago, it worked great for a while. Now it randomly stops playing (freezes). When it does this, the only thing we can do is open the tray, and close it, and hope that it reads the disc right. Which it didn't this last time. While playing a brand new DVD (so no marks or scratches and it plays fine in every other machine in the house). Definitely buying a different brand next time. Oh, and as a side note -- the remote operates on the same frequency as my sound bar, so when I try to turn that up or down, it performs random functions on the DVD player.",2
58060,I paid for a new book and recieved a torn book.,2
58738,I liked this product enough that I bought two so I’d never have to have my phone plugged in. However after 5 months it caught fire after sitting in my car without a phone in it for roughly a hour. As a result my brand new truck caught fire and now stuck with a $500 deductible to fix the damages,2
59327,Thin and sheds like crazy,2
69015,It was too wide to fit in my belt loops. I found way cheaper products that work better and do basically the same thing.,2
77873,I got this to wear when I ride my motorcycle due to the fact I'm still a begginer and to protect my knees if I was to fall however after one use they fell apart on me when I went to put them on for the second time I guess for the price they are terrible but I wish they were a bit more durable,2
63669,"I liked it until it wrapped everything up. The mystery was predictable, and the end of the novel was depressing.",2
55812,These aren’t like those bought from the Streak Free Website. Much cheaper and thinner.,2
52666,If you don't care too much how the print outs look it's ok but there will be ink missing in certain areas and lines won't be straight. They are squiggly lines!!! Don't use it for a resume or anything important. Straight lines are not straight.,2
78610,Looks and feels substantial until start to wash and use. It is not a easy convenient tool. I would not purchase again.,2
54784,"I can't tell you how long it took me to assemble the helmet. I had to put it down on the first try (AFTER my husband tried) because I just didn't have time. It is ridiculously hard to put the two pieces together because there are several connecting points that have to be aligned perfectly before it gets locked in. Because it's a flexible plastic, the points wouldn't stay aligned and it took considerable strength to push the parts together to lock in, once they were aligned. It was so frustrating. The helmet was one reason we chose this costume for a school presentation. And it was a hit, I will say that but it was so frustrating to assemble and I'm just glad I had the time to sit down with it. The jumper was fine but it is see-through. So be prepared to wear something underneath. My son wore skinny jeans and a T-shirt underneath.",2
79303,doesent cut very well doesent seem to be too sharp,2
54206,Only the pink one actually charged my phone...so far...waste of money for only one to work,2
69634,"One star for color: I got the winter blue and it looks more like an electric bright navy. This was not like the picture. Even the picture I took makes them look darker. They are actually really bright blue. One star for fit and material: I love the fit. I got a small and I’m 135 and 5’7 and they fit great, but the seam is coming out at the bottom. The material does keep me dry.",2
59043,"I like the simplicity of this style holder, but 2 of the 4 rings got floppy after 1 day of use. They still function as a finger grip, but will not work as a prop.",2
41895,Super cheap and didnt fit the cable worth a hoot. I would return but would probably cost more than it's worth. Would not recommend,2
48354,In my personal opinion it looks nothing like what I was looking for. Shipping was great though came in like two days of ordering,2
54557,Junk.... stay with OEM if at all possible.,2
76164,I’m giving this a 2 star because the fit is as expected. But the quality is awful! Almost like t-shirt material! Very cheap looking. These shorts should be $4 at most!,2
64299,Shows for furniture and I bought multiple but it came in and says do no use on furniture or upholstery,2
64965,I did not like this book and wont read the rest of that series that I ordered. Did not like the characters.,2
48779,Not the greatest. They tear easily and get caught on clothes. The material sucks.,2
53188,"Color dull, not at all like the picture. The material is very thin and clingy- not in a good way. Wrinkles so easily.",2
79258,I bought this because everyone was raving they are like lululemons. I did not like how these looked on me at all. They don’t hold you in like lulu or Fabletics leggings. I felt like it gave me camel toe which is a problem I’ve never had before.,2
41961,"After five days of use counter quit working and had to buy a driveway sensor off a friend because it was shipped without one, I contacted seller but they gave me the run around so it was easier to just buy one off my friend, but it works good no thanks to seller",2
58135,Not a huge fan of this. I think we burnt worse using this.,2
59993,Broke right for the first time,2
49987,This cd is a waste of time.,2
47250,"So far it hasn’t died on me and only charge it once in a while, the big downside is the fact that the left earbud keeps cutting off way to often and the fact that the earbuds will slip out of my ear no matter what size you end up putting in the ear bud",2

48950,"If you are intending to use these for cleaning, you are going to get frustrated. They don't work after a few weeks. The glass is nice, but th3 sprayer is junk.",2
49175,"This screen protector was easy to apply, and I had it for a while. Unfortunately, I dropped my phone on the metro floor and the iPhone screen still shattered. The screen protector was okay, but not the screen.",2
54813,"We usually enjoy these, but in this box half of the sticks have mold on them. There is no way for me to return them, so I'm leaving this review.",2
62768,This novel deals with prejudice in a simplistic and heavy handed way more appropriate for children. It is a sort of allegory without any realistic development of characters. Not worth the time for an adult reader.,2
75589,"Not creamy, hard to scoop out of jar except in chunks, doesn't rub smoothly over skin. Oh well, I tried it.",2
45467,"Very thin, not horrible, but not spectacular",2
53168,"I have ordered these eye drops before, and they came with a label that was in color, having bright red and other colors. These came in a box that had the colors, but the bottle labels are in black white and gray. And states that the product has been repackaged. The repackaged eye drops are not as thick as my previous eye drops have been. They seem to be 'watered down' if you will. I have severe dry eye, and the previous eye drops helped, These bottles with the gray, white and black labels do not work as well. I am very disappointed with this order of these eye drops.",2
52673,It just didn't work for me. Voices seemed to be distorted.,2
62465,The fabric was not as sturdy as I expected it to be. I'll probably wear it as a nightgown.,2
64245,strap was sewn in a way in which it is twisted and therefore does not lay flat on chest when wearing as a cross body bag,2
45640,Very uncomfortable and I am tiny,2
191859,"Love this! Not only can I travel all day without having to find a way to charge my phone, but it actually makes it a lot easier to handle the phone given the weight and shape. The case also does a great job protecting the phone- I've dropped it at least 5 times since using this case and it's been fine every time! Would definitely recommend.",5
173793,"Expensive but so good it is worth it. Particularly on those nights when you're too tired to rinse your face. This can be wiped off instead of rinsed. I have very sensitive skin and this leaves it soft and without any irritation. I don't even need to use any type of moisturizer when I use this cleanser. You need so little of this, it lasts a very long time; making the price much more reasonable in the long run.",5

183554,"I love these headphones!!!! The noise cancelling is amazing, a must have when flying. Great for blocking out background noise, totally saved my flight when a crying baby was on the plane. Sound is great, clear highs and strong bass... all in balance. The bluetooth connection is very stable. The microphone in the headphones is extremely sensitive and can be a bit much when using for phone calls. The battery life is astounding... charge it up before a business trip and I dont have to worry about it until I get home. Worth every penny!!!!",5
196710,Great gift for teachers,5

9669,Purchases to try to help my cat. 16 years old with a heart and kidney problem and walking a tight rope right now. She would not eat it and I did not even realize that it was supposed to be refrigerated after you open that. Or a girl that she would not eat it. I contacted the seller asking if I could return the unopened tub since I got two tubs and I believe they made a fair offer to return the money for one tub and help me just throw out the rest of it. So I supposed to get half of the purchase price back. Figured that was fair enough. Problem is when they refunded money they only refunded a quarter of the purchase price instead of half. Not sure if this was a miscommunication. So I am still trying to work on it.,1

26260,"Doesn't fit a wellie wisher. The clothes I expected to be a cheaper quality. This however is completely cheap junk. You also don't get all that is pictured, or at least I didn't. I returned.",1
1155,I just opened my package and went to apply the tempered glass like I have done on many devices. I went to pull the tab to remove the protective film before applying it to my device and there was NO plastic film. I checked the second one in the package and found the very same thing. Just a peel tab stuck directly to the tempered glass it self. Very Unhappy with the product quality!,1
27001,Couldn't figure out how to inflate it.,1
27435,This product did not help my poodle at all. It fit just like the picture showed but it rubs the penis of the dog because of where the velcro attaches to the unit. I even wrapped the sewn edge to pad where it hits. My dog was pretty much bed ridden so it wasn't due to him moving around. It caused us another problem. Save your money and just wait 1 or 2 months for your dog to heal.,1
7787,"As another reviewer stated, mine also arrived and had no flame effect. All the LEDs just glow together.",1

2163,This REALLY sucks bad.,1
33078,This product was definitely not authentic. It was thick like lotion or conditioner and not liquid. I had to return it.,1

8958,"I guess I can call myself lucky as I did get the scissors in my package, unlike other reviewers. However the blade cover is not to be found. Packaging for the item was not sealed. The glue did not hold the plastic to the cardboard. I’m guessing the blade cover fell out wherever these are packaged. I wouldn’t mind if I had just ordered a scissors, but I ordered a scissors WITH A BLADE COVER. I should be getting what I ordered.",1
15272,They don't work...after pairing them to my phone the music would just cut out. I do not recommend.,1
27777,Impossible to program,1
11132,"This is the cheapest made thing I've ever bought for my kitchen. The pump buttons don't work. I at for almost 15 minutes just pumping the button over and over, and the oil didn't move more than a 1/4 inch after all that. The buttons kept popping out and separating from the housing every 10 pumps or so. Taking it apart and putting it back together helped for all of about 5 pumps, and then it stopped working again. If it had better construction I'm sure it would be great, but in this form it is essentially useless. I finally looked it up online and found this is a huge issue with it, but for some reason those reviews haven't propagated to the Amazon page for the product yet.",1
6281,Please don't buy. The hook up to the power block is just horible. One set of lights only does red,1
27390,"Computer started acting weird/buggy after installation fine. Shortly after my computer COMPLETELY crashed and my computer started beeping the code for failed RAM.

Turns out it was the same gamble as going with the cheap stuff.",1

10284,"This could and should be a good book to read. However, every sentence it seemed to feel should use God’s name in vain.As an author surely you can find a better way to express yourself!! One day you will meet your maker on bended knee and will have to explain yourself!",1
151975,Can't give 5 stars for that. Adequate product so far.,4
144997,Pretty cool. Had higher expectations. But still enjoyed it.,4
129442,Using this at home to cut my husbands hair. It's very nice and neck size is adjustable with multiple buttons. Would def recommend!,4
157208,Bought it for a dance performance. Handles were full of glass bits as other people complained. wrapped some tape around it. Did a good job. I wish it came in longer length. Didn't look good in the performance as I expected. good for kids not grownup.,4
122724,"Had issues with first unit, customer service was great in getting me replacement, has worked great ever since! Perfect option for people looking for small backup camera and dash cam!",4

153555,"Not very consistent in elastic stretch/size, but very cute!",4
121493,2 reasons for 4 star first is it's too white. That might sound silly but it's even whiter than the face plate it comes with it so white it's extremely noticeable. Second it's really loud it ticks like an old dang clock.,4
129694,Good looking product.,4
155657,Don’t expect to fit a lot in here . It’s a little smaller than expected it will do for short hikes.,4
130384,The purse could have been a little larger. But basically like it.,4
137590,"Thought it would have more of an orange flavor, thus 4 stars. Tastes more grapefruit like. Was impressed with how I felt the day after a heavy workout. I was not as sore and tired like I normally would be. BCAA was the only new item I added so it had to be that.",4
155178,"SHORT AND CLEAN ROMANCE. IT WAS A LITTLE TOO BRIEF, AND TOTALLY IMPLAUSIBLE, BUT I STILL LIKED IT. I WOULD READ MORE BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR.",4
159751,"Well it works great, and is the best doggy dental solution I've found so far. The only problem is my dog chews the wrong end because it's easier to bite pieces off. If only it were double sided instead of having the cute handle.",4

131530,The table itself is exactly what you would hope for but one small problem the black paint on the sides seems to peel off quite easily not very noticeable but the only thing preventing this table from being a 5 star!,4
143929,Really cute design on this keychain alarm. Purchased for my daughter's 75 year old great grandma. She is still active and independent and because I purchased a different set for my daughter I thought of her safety as well. I didn't personally try the alarm as this was a gift but my daughter and her nana did and said it was loud.,4
138328,"Cute and soft. Purchased at $20, a bit overpriced.",4
136007,"When I bought this set I was aware that they were going to be heavier than a nylon utensil but I wanted the extra protection it gives to my pots. It is heavier for sure, but easy to get used to. Great quality.",4
147242,"She did not come looking as nice as the photos show, which was why I gave it 4 starts because I had to purchase makeup to make her look decent. Not sure why her head is so yellow and she has skimpy brows but I was able to fix it with makeup. I pierced her ears and changed her lips and also gave her some brows. You could also use her without the head but I needed it so I put the work in. She is sturdy for the most part. She is a good buy especially if you are good with makeup.",4
133417,"so far I'm not unhappy, I have found some devices it will not work with.",4
139979,"These socks are great fabric and look well made, but they are HUGE! They come up to my daughter's thighs. We fold them down, so it's not a huge deal. I was just surprised at how long they are.",4

126122,"I use this projector as a home video projector. I use it in place of a tv. While it does come with speakers, they were very tin sounding and gave me a headache. Instead, I ordered separate $20 computer monitor speakers and the combination work great. This projector did have a wear frame skipping thing going on with one of my laptops though because the FPS match was 1 off. My projector runs at 59 FPS which I cannot change anywhere. I have to use a separate laptop and change my laptop’s core settings to be flexible with this and to force it to stream up to 59 FPS. Other than that, the picture is good, focuses well, the planing is good, nothing else to note!",4
158089,Perfect fit summer nights where u just went to leave the window open and no mosquitoes biting at you,4
137359,"It’s a very heavy duty product. I was looking for an extension cord which is flexible as I have lot of power cords which take lot of space when powered in. This is a very smart device as each single station can be rotated and it can accommodate large power cords too easily. Another cool feature is USB adaptor which can be used to charge phone directly. There are two limitations with the product though 1) as I understand from using it, it does not has over charge protection 2) the max current combined of the USB port is 2.1 A which is kind of less if both the USB stations are in use",4
120219,Absolutely love the crackers the flavor if you’re doing low-carb I give them a thumbs up. The downside is they are very costly for a cracker and I wish I could buy them somewhere and not have them shipped because they arrive mostly broken up. I had a hard time finding one whole cracker in the bay,4

124551,This Item Came A Little Different From The Picture But Was Still Very Cute. The Colors Were The Same. I Love It!!!,4
156042,"Very strong product. Generally does a good job, but I would only use it for spot treatment. Every time I lathered it on a big area it leaves my skin very red.",4
126523,Fits a little longer than others I have purchased but so cute.,4
139156,It is nice color but my lips feel sensitive when I put this on.,4
136566,A Tony bit smaller than I expected but it does the job. Great price,4
156160,It is a very well written paranormal romance that draws you in from the beginning. The relationship takes place on the psychic and physical plane and you get an intimate look at both Rage and Pandora and really understand their motivations and their feelings. Maybe it is a little rushed but that's my opinion mostly because I prefer slow burn romances... Like previous books I really liked this one to.,4
124133,I read the reviews before ordering and i got them and i really like them. Not as true to color as the picture but close enough.,4
122539,"At first I was really excited about this find. It looks sleek and nice. It fits under cabinet fine. But when lifting the head, it hits the wall, so it has to be pulled out some, wouldn’t be a big deal, but the awesome thing that keeps it from bouncing around(suction cups on the bottom), makes it a bit of an ordeal. But easily ignored. The one thing I am very disappointed about, everytime I use it, is how far the mixing tools(paddle and whisk) are from the actual bowl. Easily 1/4 of an inch away. It makes the mixture leave a layer of mix against the bowl, never to be touched by the mixing tools. So it HAS to be turned off and sides scraped, multiple times during use. Way past the time to send back, and is better than having nothing. However, I would look for one that has the mixing tool much closer to the edges of the bowl, so you really can leaving it mixing to itself.",4
150888,"Looks a little cheesy, a little smaller than I thought it’d be",4
153535,Letters are too small to read from my chair to me TV stand.,4
122050,"The pillow case, zippable, is wonderful. The first night I used I put my pillowcase on it. It was stuffed and I knew it would too high. However, I used it. My neck ache was worse. I removed three handfuls of the foam the next night. It was better. Removed four more large handfuls that night. Much better next morning. Future buyer: you may have to adjust the amount of filling to suit your needs.",4
159778,"This attachment is awesome. The adapter raises the possibility of the Headphones. Audio sounds great coming from the adapter, but the volume is not as loud as it is wired. One big con is their is some type of sound that the adapter makes. It sounds like there is a bit of frequency. Another con of the adapter is the price. The way the buttons click and the adapter feel is not what you would expect from something that cost $50. If this product was between $30-40 it would be fair. Another con is the batter life is on the short range. It is not terrible but if it could last 2hrs longer it would be perfect.",4
134755,The dress is exactly as pictured and really very pretty. It fits my daughter but may be a tad big around the chest. Not too big that she can't wear it. She's tall and lean so overall it probably is true to size. Definitely recommend it.,4

139702,Good until it got a hole in it. Now I need to find where it's at.,4

110316,Had mystery and romance a plenty! Nicole Jordan books are always filled with adventure. This book was a reading pleasure.,3
97860,Not too good quality,3
109746,"Nice spacious bag. Can fit multiple items, especially if you have multiple children. The only problem I have is the chemical smell of the bag. This makes me question what could be in the materials to emit such a strong, chemical odor.",3
107813,Was good enough originally - but plastic parts didn’t hold and now it slides down after a couple of days when I tighten it and falls over. Maybe find a way to keep the screws and the plastic knob from slipping?,3
91757,Quality is good but pretty bulky,3
117219,I got what I paid for. Okay quality. Good for apartment or 1 person.,3

82238,"Bought to try. Works surprisingly well. Wish it was larger, considering the price.",3
101885,"The collar works, but the prongs must be situated right under the dog's mouth. If it strays even a half inch in either direction, the collar doesn't detect any barking - even on the highest sensitivity level. I have the collar really tight and it still swivels. I'm afraid to make it any tighter. The prongs are already digging into him.",3
97292,It wasn’t as good as I thought it would be. The side doesn’t hold it in real well,3
83966,"Does not last as long as I expected, particularly in the heat! Works well for a couple hours though.",3
90234,it was a little tart..,3
112986,Over priced for what it is.,3
83687,This case was good for the first two weeks until the whole rim around the case came off. I recommend this case if you have a back up case also the case gets lots of scratches.,3
80358,Appearance. Not packaged well honey all over the outside of the package. Product fell out of the cardboard when I picked it up. Seems awfully thin for honey.,3
102300,"It looks nice. But it took so long for shipping, and its corner is broken.",3
102523,This is my second order but this time I got a lot of liquid instead mineral from the container when use. Did anyone have the same experience? Is it a bad batch?,3
86662,"I was bummed he two tracks didn’t fit together. Be aware that here are he light up tracks as well as other normal tracks, but the two do not work together. I prefer the normal tracks over the light up. They’re more pliable and easier to put together.",3

113634,"Meh. It works, you get what you pay for.",3
113361,"The lock itself is perfect for my needs, but the mounting bracket is a true disappointment. I had to tighten the mounting screw on every ride, and it is absolutely annoying. In this price range this problem should to eliminated. Now i have to use an extra velcro strap to fix the wobble and keep the lock in the desired position.",3
107010,Not the picture shown. The pic was supposed to be vertically oriented ... and a different photo. What I rec’d is an OK pic but I needed a vertically oriented pic for the place I wanted to hang it. Disappointed.,3
92534,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE PRODUCT - NOT THE SELLER. SELLER IS GREAT! This MIGHT be a good product, I purchased it because I thought curcumin would be a good thing to take. However, when I opened the bottle it was SMURF blue! The manufacturer felt the need to add FD&C Blue #1 to the product. First - WHY; and second, if you're adding a DYE, why BLUE? Isn't curcumin orange/yellow? I strongly feel that if it is not necessary to the quality or performance of the product - keep it as pure as possible. I've got to think (and I'll research this) that the DYE is not dangerous, but I question the necessity to add it at all... Not sure if I'm keeping it or not - was just VERY surprised when I opened the bottle!",3
109393,"I'll keep the hat, but it's not what I expected or really wanted. The body of the hat is, indeed, unstructured but the brim is not in the least soft. Instead, it is a stiff material which is sewn in three separate pieces so that the bill can be folded.",3
104505,I thought I ordered it for a IPhone.,3
89520,"If you have to use the extensions, they are worthless. They are so flimsy my puppy had figured he can push hard enough and break through. If you don’t need those it’s perfect .",3
111425,"The construction seems decent, laser works, good ease of use, however I'm not sure how accurate this is. You can turn the bullet a tad and the laser will point slightly differently. It is not perfectly aligned with your barrel, so at 25 yards can be pretty off.",3
109514,"I realize that when you make a forecast you may be wrong,however I watch weather news to see what they think will happen. So far this channel seems very timid in the forecast department. Geez take a chance.",3
107965,This was my 2nd set. Loved the first one so ordered the 2nd one and the first time I put it on the elastic broke on the fitted sheet which sort of bummed me out so be careful.,3
86307,Not very comfortable but does help with pain and stress on shoulder.,3
80472,"Loud. I bought this hoping it would be quieter than my original, but no. I guess noise is just inherent in this type of cooler.",3
119376,Work OK but tend to loosen,3
116281,It didn't stay on...It kept coming off,3
90305,"The suit itself is cute and the color is great. BUT the built in cups are probably big enough for nothing more than a C-cup, unless the underwire is through the middle of the breasts. Very disappointed.",3
93048,This is a nice watch but does have some of the flaws mentioned in other reviews. It's also a bit bulky.,3
105756,Heard repair never work that well,3
106176,Cable to short for crew cab long bed pickups. It's about 4 feet to short to work on our 05 Ford F-350 crew cab long bed. Now i'm trying to band aid a solution. Can't replace as it has the trigger wire for the cam at the dash end and a tap for reverse light at the back end. Shenanigans.,3
100698,"Good product for a quick touchup, not for everyday use.",3
80447,"Product fits my daughter's new tablet perfectly and I love the design. I was a little bummed the case came damaged when there was no damage to the outer packaging. My kiddo is 8 so there's no sending it back and waiting for the replacement. Still, I'm happy with the purchase overall",3
86713,She really liked it.,3
109051,Thicker than expected and the fabric is runny but overall it’s pretty good.,3
81257,A little big for newborns. But good for one year old baby’s or more. Fabric is very soft.,3
81949,Does PQQ help with MEMORY PROBLEMS? I purchased it because I read an article that says it does help memory issues. Not one review on here has mentioned any of the sort. Please advise. Thanks,3
118619,Dress fit ok but was see through and not finished well.,3
115504,Pages were all blank. I expected a general outline for needed information,3
113705,Plastic; sweats on surfaces when filled with drinks and ice.,3
110297,"Very cute, my kids are really enjoying learning to sew with these. This particular brand, however, looses the color on the plastic. This is a problem because you need the color to know where to put your stitches. It rubs off over time making it slightly more difficult to figure out where to put what color. But there are other things I like better than other kits. Like the actual metal needle. Others only come with plastic needles. And the holes on this kit are smaller which, in my opinion, makes the finished product look better.",3
87882,"They are a nice weight and the color is pretty, but the d12 is a bit uneven and the d8 shipped with a small chip. I do wish that they did have the turquoise marbling as shown on the photo.",3
102434,"It's exactly what I excepted it to be. However, I just want to state a suggestion/improvement to the product. It would be nice if you have a quantity of 4 sets of legs. That way you could use an extra set to raise your stand a little higher. So I will have 2 spare plastic platforms and 2 outfitted with all the legs. I needed to raise my monitor just a tad more than what was provided. So, I ordered another one just so I can raise my other stand.",3
94299,Perfect for what we paid and where we are using the product. Will move it into the garage in a year or two and upgrade to something better for where it is at now.,3
91202,They worked well. I liked the fit and look but after 3 months of moderate use they no longer turn on.,3
80731,"I was really disappointed by this stuff. Some reviews said it was great for fine hair, but unfortunately, it made my very fine hair greasy and weighed it down. I’ve used a very small amount and tried it for a few weeks, but it just isn’t working for me. It would probably be ok for semi-fine hair, but my search for a shine and anti-frizz product that works on truly super fine hair continues!",3
101594,This book is designed for a caregiver in a group home setting. Not for someone that is taking care of an elderly parent with dementia. The author has some good points but overall the book did not provide anything I didn’t already know.,3
101442,This was a great idea but fell short of what I wanted and needed. Half and half is available in most places I travel and it tastes so much better. For countries that don’t have half and half this will have to do.,3
116271,"good screen resolution, lightweight. however it sometimes overheats when charging and takes long to charge. the voice unlock is intermittent and face unlock DOES NOT WORK",3
104623,The diffuser bracelet didn't fit. The leather piece could be longer to accommodate a larger bony wrist. The chakra beads are great! A little tight for me but still workable since it's elastic. I would buy again for friends with smaller wrists.,3
107018,My husband spent a little more money on this net than some other choices. But we were disappointed by the quality. It didn’t seem more heavy-weighted netting and the knots nearest to the rim came undone (the net was not installed and I think one of my kids grabbed it but the knots slip out easily) and so we had to re-tied knots). Clearly that is not easily done. We couldn’t figure out the type of knot they used in the first place.,3
97591,"These fit fine/somewhat small, but are made of very thin fabric. They are really more like think tights. Fine only if you plan to wear with a long tunic.",3
106834,"These are for use IN DARK AREAS! I admit, I didn't pay enough attention to the description. The automatic mode works great in low light and dark areas but if there's any significant amount of light in the room they simply won't turn on automatically, and the switch is a bit too difficult to justify constantly turning these on and off. I tried to set these up in the corner of a room that could use a little more light, but these lights would never turn on because there were still ceiling lights in the room and it wasn't quite dark enough to trigger it. I found a good use for them next to the front door so when we enter the house at night it turns on and we don't trip over any pets that might come running to the door. That being said, if you have pets the battery life of these will probably not be as great as you might expect because they will trigger only at night... your mileage may vary.",3
97371,Didn’t like it. Made my hair feel greasy and heavy no matter how much I used. Didn’t give me any type of beach look,3
