127855,Makes greAt coffee but coffeemaker does not allow your hand to get into that coffee pot to clean it; therefore coffee residue stays in bottom of pot. I like the attachment that removes chlorine from the Warne. Auto brew timer is a great feature.,4
152307,It's everything it says it is.... Works perfect for us!!!!,4
120267,"Well in the picture it says it has 2 vibrators when it really has only one. Other than that it's light and very versatile, I use it for my herniated disc and my epicondylitis and it's great that it's wireless cos I can take it with me to trips and restaurants and stuff. I just think the publicity has to be more accurate. It wouldn't hurt if it really had 2 vibrating points, and better yet, that not only the middle part vibrated but all 3 sections we're functional. Just an idea for Homedics.",4
130126,I like this book. Glad Rebecca and Alex realized that they love one another. Sad that Heather had such hate for Rebecca that she would hurt people,4
156282,This pot is on point. Very good. No sticking.very easy to clean and cooks perfectly fine,4
133660,"These fit well and are very comfortable but are rather frail. Best hand washed or, as last resort, washed on delicate/cold water in the washing machine. Do not dry in the clothes drier if that can be avoided.",4
157316,"Not really a blue light at night, more like a yellow white light. Still, it's better than nothing.",4
141204,"I was skeptical but my better half ordered two of these. We made use of the suggestions from other people who bought these and gave them a good review. Very sturdy. We put them together with the addition of gorilla glue on the pegs. We assembled them and let them sit overnight to let the adhesives dry and do their job. The cranky comments from people who didn't follow the instructions, moving the item right after assembly, not assembling them properly, etc. are tiresome. This is not heirloom furniture but it does the job if you put it together properly.",4
153551,Love the look of this costume. My daughter loves it - good for twirling! :) Only complain is cheapness of accessories - the gems on the wand fell off after 5 minutes of trying it on. Hopefully we can glue them back on.,4
153131,It is beautiful but it slide off the table a lot.,4
141379,Basement humidity is much better using this,4
147747,My daughter got this book for Christmas. It is great to be given so many ideas of things to draw. I just wish there was some sort of instruction or a picture to copy. It is literally an empty book.,4
144727,"Nice looking, appears to be well-made. Not as lightweight as I would have hoped, but perhaps it can't serve its purpose at a light weight. The tightening screws, handles, etc., are sturdy, and legs are stable. Will work well.",4
136619,"But the metal join on one side has a small snag. It isn't enough to stop me from using them, but it is noticeable as I knit. Otherwise they're great, and I like the finish on the needles--not so slick my work slides off but smooth.",4
140855,"Thought that I would stand upright for the most part, but it kind of folds over when it is full. It is durable and lightweight for taking to the laundromat",4
128778,"as advertised, loved it",4
6468,Not great as hair gets tangled in brush. And this with short hair,1
14064,I normally wear a 2xl got the Xl I could have gotten the large very thin material Fix's like a maternity top,1
20862,Absolutely does not work for my new iPhone 7Plus. After about 5 seconds the screen showed “not a supported accessory “ or something to that effect.,1
35994,"seriously. it was so hard to open my arms hurt and hour later. I can lift a 20 lb bag of cat food (not that I do it often, but it's possible for me to do without issue). in comparison, this was a nightmare. I'm using it as a grow light, not for a workshop, so I have no experience with work lights. So the word clamp has specific connotations... They DO NOT INCLUDE, that they must be twisted TOGETHER TO close. It's not like a hair clip, like a regular clamp. I figured id attach it to the shelf above to keep it upright by CLAMPING it on.. You know, like a CLAMP. YOU CAN'T. it needs to hang from a pole. a freaking pole. it's basically the equivalent of a stronger twist tie that will supply power to a bulb. it's cheap - in price, looks and construction. So the only people who will be able to find this useable are those very strong, with freaking POLES!",1
27746,Says it was delivered and I never received it. Unsure of how to contact seller,1
37654,Had to constantly change battery. Worked sometimes,1
15250,"This is the worst scale I've ever owned. I can step on the scale without clothes and then again fully clothed and weigh the exact same thing. It's almost like this scale remembers your last weight and if it's close, just displays the same thing over and over. Other scales I've had in the past are so accurate that you can literally see an ounce difference when you add or remove weight. DO NOT buy this thing if you are weighing in daily or keeping close track of your weight. All it is good for is a generalized number and is definitely not accurate!",1
18387,"Needlessly had way too many alien species. Physics as described made no sense. Like the human eye could see ships across a solar system, or see laser beams in vacuum Portals visible at distances described.",1
28565,"I love tapatio, so this is not a bad review of the product but rather the vendor. They shipped the glass bottles with no type of protection and when they arrived to my location all the bottles were broken.",1
29449,Way too small band ! Doesn't extend.. partner feels his area is going to loose oxygen cause it's so tight.. other than That it's good,1
32921,Horrible! They are very tiny and are not the same as the ones in the pictures. They could probably fit into the mouth of a newborn baby but that's about it.,1
33703,"I loved it, but it broke right away!",1
17740,Two of the bulbs burnt out within a day of use. One is still working. I would NOT buy these again!!,1
32096,"The main point I want to make is that the camera works as expected, unfortunately as soon as summer came along the body could not stand the heat and warped so that it no longer will stay in the mount. I live in southern CA and it isn't really that hot. I think that anyone using this camera in Phoenix would likely have a puddle on their dash after leaving the car closed up all day in the AZ heat. In my humble opinion I would not recommend this as a first choice.",1
33990,Don't Wast your Money,1
2880,"Made with low quality plastic which breaks easily, not good for daily use.",1
83787,The color is nice and I wear it all the time when it's raining. But it's a little too thin for me. It was also a little tight in the chest area.,3
107394,"Outlets are really close together -think about what you want to plug in before buying. I purchased this to plug in 3 cords (not USB). Due to the sizes of the plugs, only 2 would fit and the middle outlet was pretty useless.",3
119023,"I cannot decide if I like them or dislike them... As someone who is fairly comfortable with putting false lashes on with lash glue, I find these extremely difficult to put on. The length of the magnet is fairly short. Once I was able to adhere the magnets, I was shocked at how comfortable they were on. However, because the length of the magnet is so short, the lashes look like they were hanging on for dear life. It's like when you wear false lashes and one of the corners doesn't stay on so you have that lash peeking out. I may have to cut them, but I think they will end up looking like corner lashes instead of full lashes. I think with better practice, this may work out for me BUT it might take more magnetic lashes since you have to be extremely gentle with them or else they start to fray/peel off the band and lose its original form. Also, to clarify, you get 8 pieces but they're only 2 pairs of magnetic lashes (2 pieces for each eye), not 8 pairs of magnetic lashes.",3
115646,"Wish the closet was longer, the parts don't fit as well as I would like and the doors don't connect together for the closet part making them all mini cubes without the cube part all opens separate.",3
115171,"Great product ....while it lasts, which isn’t long. It starts to lose power/strength of vibrations very quickly after first purchasing it and continues to diminish until the product stops working completely. Many speeds that are great and it’s rather strong when it’s operating at its full power capacity. If you’re looking for a quality made product, there are probably better choices but for a (fairly) cheap toy, it works well.",3
104384,The story line was good but not enough love/sex scenes for a romance novel. Maybe I just expect more.,3
95389,I was sent a different shade than I ordered.,3
105667,You might as well just dump this stuff out and replace it with some apple cider vinegar. It doesn't work as well and dries up fast. It will still kill a few here and there but not as fast as the apple cider vinegar on its own. Save your money and get the large bottle at the store and you'll be fine.,3
108393,over all book was in good shape just upset that the dust jacket came damaged but all pages were clear and there,3
107849,Not sure if these run small or if my head is just too big? I ended up giving it away to my little cousin. I really liked the hat. It’s so soft inside BUT it would not stay on my head.,3
101944,I mounted these lights under my cabinets last night. This morning I found them laying on my countertops and on the floor.,3
118027,Beware these are not the size that are in the picture.. They say they are light blocking but they really aren't that dark. I have some I bought from target and they do not let any light in! These aren't worth the money!,3
91302,Very nice bag. Compact and smart looking,3
117890,"Havent noticed much change in my hair with pulling verses a normal pillow case, but these pillow cases do NOT breath. At night you will get very hot if you run hot already. I should have known...",3
111706,I love the purple color. Seems sturdy. But I bought it for the sleep/wake function and that does not work.,3
81044,Good glasses. Lens kept popping out so I had to glue it in.,3
193078,love these greeting cards! they're small but adorable. will definitely be buying again.,5
166523,I buy it for my granddaughter to do crafts with. She like the tapes and sticks it on everything. She uses the tapes to decorate her iPhone 6s which with a clear case gives it a one of a kind look. With this pack it gives you 40 different tapes and she loves them all. She put them all in a ziploc bag and has been toting them around like a long lost treasure. This is the second set I have ordered and there will be more orders in the future! Thanks for the great product!,5
184007,"Perfect fit, and service",5
164688,"What a funny and educational book, I read it to my nephew, he just loved it ! would not let me stop. Author has really captured how kids think and their responses to them",5
164368,"I used this product for a spring party, and it worked out great. Pair it up with the Hawaiian shaved ice flavors and you have a hit",5
161787,Fits and looks sleek. The extension should fit angled grip and small light.,5
173895,Great for beginners and travel,5
196665,"Great quality! Just what we needed! Fit was good, easy to take on and off. We have it by our pool area and great knowing TV is protected when not in use.",5
163751,The best moisturizer for my face and neck. Also use it on hands and arms as a moisturizer and ski. Softener. I have been using this product for years and it is the reason I have minimal wrinkles for being 84 years old.,5
192343,I was so pleasantly surprised with my husband's pick of this cap for me. Even the description makes it sound fun as it is. Good for a young or older person as I can attest to. The grey color universal and the tweed gives it character. Exceptionally soft but holds it shape and perfect over any hairstyle.,5
191382,These work well on dry eyes. Just use them before going to bed.,5
179846,These little eggs work wonders for potty training a stubborn toddler!,5
198580,I love my new Alta. I had a Charge 2 but really like the design of the Alta and the fact that you can change the bands. Ordering online was convenient too!,5
170545,Product as described. Excellent seller,5
198505,I will keep this one. It took a good hit at 65 ‘ and no damage to phone,5
178148,Wow! Great Concert with the return of Bobby Kimball doing his thing with as always great musicians and a sell out crowd. Great Audio and Video,5

75206,Not at all a master chief story like we’ve come to expect.,2
65709,"These are nice glasses, however, this is the second time we ordered these, and the second time in two weeks they were shipped with no packing materials...no bubble wrap, no peanuts, no paper, no nothin.' Both sets arrived with broken glasses. Now we have two uneven sets. One set of glasses was shipped with other heavy items and no packaging material...the other was sent in an empty box with no packaging material. I hate to give nice glasses a low rating...it's the shipping that lacks.",2
62893,"These did not work out for me at all. I wear a Women's size 10 medium and these were too small and cramped my toes. The fabric made my feet feel very hot too. I did like how they don't slip around your foot though. Because they were too small for a Women's 10, I returned them.",2
79853,For the price I figured they wouldn’t be as good as the more expensive ones but they are made of extremely thin sheet metal. Have a 1-2” gap around them and do not even include rubber for the edges just a foam round foam sticky pad for the bottom corner. If you aren’t looking for quality or a tight fitting door then these are for you! If you want something that actually seals up the lowers then purchase a different product,2
47356,"These wipers clear the windshield well but are very noisy, will not buy again.",2
47801,"Probably dont get this if you need a protector because you drop your phone frequently. I dropped my phone and the entire protector just popped off (because it attaches around the circumference of the screen, unmentioned in the product description) and the entire right side of my screen is all cracked now. Probably fine if you just want to protect your screen from scratches? I guess.... Wishing their ""Lifetime Replacement Warranty"" worked to replace my phone. Also, this thing definitely is not smudge resistant, which isn't important to me, but worth mentioning.",2
75100,"Wasn’t what I expected, material really thin and the speakers keep shifting in the headband, it doesn’t stay aligned with the ears.",2
66019,Disappointed that the case broke after having it on my phone for only a month.,2
63580,3 pods didn't grow this is not my first time using aero garden pods!!!!!,2
77178,"The color of Turmeric in my second order is different. It is lighter Turmeric color, and does not smell the same. I think it is a lower quality Turmeric",2
42840,It is cute but not durable. I got it in April and the little strap broke all ready. The band isn't even broken in yet.,2
74486,The cover is pretty. But I've had it in my purse for a few weeks and it's not in a high traffic pocket and the binding is already coming undone. If I used it every day I could see that be justified but I don't.,2
64412,i found this book pretty boring! did not finish the book !,2
57524,you get what you pay for,2
45348,The product is very miss leading of the size they are nowhere near what it looks like in the picture. Definitely read the description the pieces were no long that 16 inches and less than a 1/2 inch thick. Better for a small 10 gallon,2
