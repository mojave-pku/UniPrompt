128391,This game is a lot of fun.,4
148765,I also bought the solar ones--love it. My advice is to get the solar and not worry about batteries,4
150547,As noted in at least one other review product arrived with no top. When I have purchased this product in a pet store it has always had a top on it. This is my favorite aroma of the other colognes in this product line; last only a day or so which is disappointing.,4
124668,Love it and results!! Only thing is it was pretty messy,4
137341,Bras are very comfortable. Perfect for breastfeeding.,4

120130,I love these glasses. Very good quality and they look great on me. I'm happy.,4
131492,"The window of time to return this product was one month. Although the product broke one week after that return window closed, the merchant was very responsive and was able to rectify the situation by replacing the product. Iâ€™m very impressed with their professionalism and responsiveness to the matter. They are definitely customer oriented.",4
159639,"They're a little looser than I was expecting but I think I'm just in between sizes (xs and small). Overall, length is great.",4
138131,"Loving it so far, although I do feel the suction isnâ€™t perfect but enough to do the job.",4
131197,"The bottles says to take one, three times a day. I take one a day and lets just say that has been plenty.",4
120335,Very cute! Fits the note 9 well.,4
129935,As advertised though heavy and need larger bite.,4
136014,"Almost as I expected, the picture on the case is faded and not as clear as I would've liked.",4
123297,This movie was funny however some parts didnt play well,4
34605,The package my tiara was sent in didn't protect it and when I opend the package the tiara was broken. Very unhappy that it was delivered broken and bent.,1
18357,"Balls and mounds of lint everywhere. Covered my sheets, my clothing and after three wash and dry cycles it was worse than ever. Very soft but just made too big a mess.",1
36068,Mine was broken where the warranty seal is. I tried to put it in the printer anyways very gently and it was so fragile that it broke apart. Good packaging so I doubt that it was damaged during shipping.,1
4829,"To small for my motto e4 plus, will send it back.",1
39208,The pole of the umbrella bent in wind that wasnâ€™t blowing hard enough to rustle trees. Donâ€™t waste your money.,1
18947,"I replaced the ink with these and the printer does not recognize them. I have tried several times to take them out, put them back in. I shut off the printer and tried it again. Nothing seems to work. Brand new and useless for me as they are not recognized.",1
36291,Have it for a week doesn't work bug still flying around my house,1
19947,Did not seat properly upon rib of 870 shotgun. The baseplates under the rib bend when you screw them in tightly. Upon tightening one of the baseplates stripped out. Pretty cheap design.,1
543,The chord either was defective or not compatible with our PC and monitor. There is little help provided from the manufacturer,1
4108,Junky. Poorly made.,1
2740,This product came broke out of the package. One of the supports on the frame.,1

35172,Not touch sensitive at all. Taking it off.,1
36402,This picture frame arrived all scratched up and used/old looking. We are unhappy.,1
26723,when we recieved this product it was hard as a brick and still trying to break it up. Very disappointed.,1
114311,"I'm not sure why this was a best-seller. The first couple of chapters seemed lame but I got through them. The remainder of the book never drew me in--it's as though I was just listening to someone tell me their story. Even if you account for ""cultural differences,"" some of this story didn't make sense. It really could have been so much more and I don't understand why this made a best-seller list.",3
112078,"I had an original cube in the 80â€™s, and I thought it would be fun to play with one again. I didnâ€™t want a fancy speed cube, I was just looking for one like the old toy. This one is smaller than the original, and it doesnâ€™t feel at all the same. Iâ€™ll have to keep looking. The little stand is functional but really cheap and flimsy. The logo is only silver on one side, the other two are just molded plastic. Iâ€™ll probably just put it in the shelf without the stand.",3
89969,Hard to wash. The fur on top gets all over the sides in the wash. :/,3
81532,"These turtles were good, but no better than the ones that you can get in the store for a lot less. They do NOT have real Tortuga Rum in them. It is artificial rum flavor... and it TASTES artificial too.",3
109392,I like them but they arenâ€™t made as well as in the past. Elastic isnâ€™t as sturdy. Must have new manufacturer.,3
98485,Red color could have been more bright. It was just okay.,3
106294,I ordered 2 sets of these and they're exactly what I needed. My only complaint is that the adjustment screw is so tight that I completely stripped one in trying to get it loose. Now I need to order another set.,3
96606,"Said it would fit my door, bur screws were too long, The outside handle did not fit into existing holes. The lock handle did not not fit into existing hole, in this case too much paint. This also caused the lock operation to be very hard.",3
113144,"Frustrating that you can't pull up the barcode from your phone. Who prints things anymore?!!?! The cashier was a little confused, but eventually figured it out. And, if you don't use the full balance, they don't put the rest on the card - you have to keep the paper you printed to use it again. Otherwise, it worked fine.",3
110686,"I really like the socks, just wish they came up a little higher and did not roll off my knee.",3
105691,Very cute but does not stay in/secure hair by itself. Came in a timely manner and for the price I have no complaints.,3
85307,"I like the device design and colors, but wish the changing color setting changed at a slower, more gradual pace. The device makes a ver faint, but high-pitched hissing noise and gives off an internal blue light when the upper light is turned off. This means I have to hide it under the bed. I wanted it to be a bedside charger, but the noise and light are not conducive to sleep.",3
107112,The order was fine I simply got the wrong size and did a return for the product and have ordered another one. The only thing that upset me is that I am being charged to return the item.,3
95572,worked for a week then quit working. was pretty good for the first week though.,3
101463,Smaller than expected,3
82725,I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because the actual ball entertained the puppy for a bit. The battery life on this thing isnt good. The weasel part came off day one and my Moms dog weighs 3 lbs. Def not a good buy for any dog.,3
195778,Pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. Received numerous compliments,5
191946,Having a whole town experience time travel makes for a completely different kind of time travel story. I love learning about the history of the 30 Years War in such an interesting way!,5
172095,It fits well and has been enjoyed by myself in several cosplay situations so far.,5
178701,Great energy snack bar . I purchased this to keep me awake while driving. It keeps me alert. Nice chocolate flavor with crispy bites.,5
162881,"I bought several Anker power banks for Christmas gifts last year and every unit, except for one, is still up and running. After working great for a little over a year one power bank stopped charging itself. I tried different cables to charge the power bank but nothing worked. Finally, I contacted Ankerâ€™s customer support and in less than a week they had shipped out a replacement power bank! Love this company and their products!",5
162760,"Yes, I will be ordering more. These are perfect to bling out a shoe!!",5

161074,"I am a Nurse and I bought these sox for work, they are soft and great for circulation, I love them.",5
177119,"I have to wear steel toed shoes and I hate always have to tying my shoes. I found these no tie shoelaces and watched the instructional video and figured these would suit me just fine. So when I received my pair (mind you it comes is a very cute package), I reviewed the video again as I didn't want to mess it up. The instructional video is SO helpful and so easy to follow. I am on my feet all day and these laces are fabulous. They stay in place and are comfortable. I never have to worry about laces coming undone. These are a must have! Thank you for developing a great product.",5
174228,This thing is small. It works with most games I tried and holds a good charge.,5
198161,Very helpful product,5
169585,"My three year old loves this cup, and actually picked it himself.",5
176354,I have osteo arthritic problems with my lower back and this support makes me much more comfortable and enables greater freedom of movement. Customer support is excellent.,5
161239,Fantastic I have a arctic entry way with no door small entrance way into house..and it is cold no heat put this up and the living room hold the heat ..would recommend..,5
67333,Stiff and the gloves restrict finger movement making clutch brake and throttle motions more difficult,2
43084,I tried all three flavors and I usually like pumpkin seeds but these bars did not taste at all good.,2
43543,Two stars because they're absolutely adorable. They don't stick on my daughters ears well at all so we've lost most of them already ðŸ˜¢,2
58349,"When I received the product, it looked as if it had already been used. There was water in the steamer slot and hair on the iron. I used it once when I first got it and havenâ€™t used it since.",2
67782,No matter what I do I cannot get these to stay in my ears. I've almost run the lawn mower over them coz they keep falling out. So now they just sit in a drawer. Big waste of money.,2
75651,They are soggy after toasting. I tried to fix that by adding more time to the toasting but they just came out dry and difficult to eat. They also fall apart while trying to eat them. You'll need a spoon... I can get better waffles.,2
54732,"Pillow Cover slick and not a typical pillow material. Would NOT recommend. The REAL Better Homes and Garden pillow from Walmart that has insert included and not just a cover has a cost of $2.00 more and is worth the money, NOT this pillow COVER. DO NOT RECOMMEND this seller's pillow cover at all.",2
45813,Silicon portion does not quite fit and I'm very disappointed that you cant put the phone in the holster with the screen facing out. The picture shows the holster being used as a kickstand but you can't actually do that because the phone wont lock in screen facing out. Also I bought two of these in different colors and they are not even close to the same case.,2
54549,"The reason I am giving this a low rating is because these briefs are labeled as Gentle Wash, Do Not Tumble Dry. I have ALWAYS washed my underwear in regular wash and tumbled dried them. I suspect the elastic is of poor quality and will not tolerate regular wash and dry cycles.",2
78954,These claim to be hypoallergenic but I donâ€™t believe they are. I have very sensitive ears so Iâ€™m very cautious about purchasing random earrings. I read the reviews and decided to give these a go. The INSTANT I put theb in my ears my ear holes ached! I took them out immediately. I have since painted the studs with clear fingernail polish and that seems to be keeping the irritation at bay.,2
68249,died after 2 months.,2
70247,Not as durable as I thought it would be.,2
58152,"We are very disappointed. We bought a ""good"" (so we thought) peppermill. It worked for awhile, but now doesn't, and we missed the window for sending it back. Guess the name Peugeot doesn't mean what we thought it did. It is very difficult to select the grind, and it doesn't come out when you do get it there.You cannot fill it very full. Junk for $42.",2
61163,Fable 2 Heavy and too hard to get on I did not care for them at all the material was so thick too heavy for me!,2
65545,I loved the pattern but they were way shorter then the cheaper compression socks I ordered. I was really disappointed and will not be ordering from them again.,2
67028,Photo is VERY deceiving. looks like real marble in the photo and it is just a piece of plastic when you get it not worth the price wish I actually looked like rose gold and marble but it definitely doesn't.,2
