17531,I had almost not expectations while buying this product yet it still managed to disappoint me. Incredible. Don't buy anyone anything from Gildan. It's like they didn't tailor these for humans. I would like to see a single person that these t-shirts fit well. Just don't buy them. please.,1
5362,Worst equipment ever,1
26561,Never received order,1
32469,This company sent me the absolute WRONG item! I wrote to them the moment I opened the box and am STILL waiting for them to fix the issue. I would NOT recommend buying from these folks,1
12437,If I could give this 0 stars I would. None of the containers stay close! What good is that? Especially if you travel. This is the worst pill holder yet.,1
27135,This was a BOXED SET. Supposedly with multiple books. I paid full price for the set and only received one paper back. Very deceitful. Dont buy from this seller.,1
17161,"This is the tenth book, and honestly I am finished with the series and the author. These ""books"" compare to chapters in other authors novels. Consider this, at around $3 each, if you have purchased part one to part ten, you are now in this for $30 and the story isn't finished. I purchase a novel because I want to watch the characters develop, grow, see them overcome hardship and conflict, and I want to escape into their story for however long it takes. I actually enjoy a number of authors that use multiple books to tell a story. Meghan March is a master of this. I wish Hannah the best on her literary journey but I won't be following her or her writing anymore.",1
24582,"We looked all over Amazon for a new set of luggage and finally settled on this set after comparing price and reviews. Our main concern was the durability of the set. Well our fears were realized on our 1st trip. The luggage was nice and light, rolled well, had great space inside but when we picked up our luggage at the baggage claim, the largest one was missing a wheel. It had completely ripped off of the case, exposing the fabric inside the shell. The middle one lost one of the bumpers on it's spine, exposing two metal studs. Luckily United had 2 new suitcases that they swapped out right then and there for us. It just seemed like the better way to go instead of filing a claim and purchasing this set a 2nd time. We really wanted to like the set too...pretty bummed at the quality.",1

11741,"I never received this product. It was delivered to my US postal service mailbox outside my house. My mail carrier said Amazon is not authorized to deliver to mailbox ,,only to door.

5995,"I bought these and only 1 out of 10 signs that I bought was good. The material on the letters that is supposed to glow did not work. It was spotty and I could only see 1 or 2 letters in the dark for the other 9 signs. Very disappointed, plus there is no returns. Do Not Buy!!!!",1

I’m a mid level athlete / fitness female and the black band which is supposed to be the hardest / strongest went around my legs and gave me VERY little resistance in squats and lunges. Poor quality gliding discs...scratched along the floor and did not give smooth transitions.,1
15121,"I did a lot of shopping around and decided on this light because it was the cheapest of the ones with the features I wanted. Not till it arrived with no battery did I find in listing that battery was not included. Perhaps that’s my fault because I didn’t read thoroughly, but I am still pissed because now I have the light I wanted but still can’t use it till I spend more money",1
21420,Useless. Did not work. Blades are very blunt. Broke the very first time it's been used.,1
19111,they did send the order correctly,1

53037,"Price is ok, but unless you have a tap handy I would get something else. I had to use the screws I had to basically retap all the holes. Took about three times longer to mount a few pieces of equipment then it should have.",2
65360,"Unfortunately the book was labeled “new” but all 4 corners were damaged - like it had been dropped on all four corners. The cover was also damaged. I would have preferred to pay a “used” price for this book. Otherwise the instruction inside the book on drawing heads and hands is excellent. The book mostly focuses on heads, so if you’re looking more for hand instruction I might recommending trying another book. The book covers a lot on proportions and different expressions.",2
45831,Clip on outside of pan broke after 2nd use,2
77840,"Product is described as heavy duty and strong. It is flimsier than my current set, if I hadn’t thrown the box away I would return them. I won’t even be using this set. Money wasted",2

58104,"They enjoyed it, but it broke apart way to fast",2

45417,stopped charging after 2 years,2
45056,"I’m confused by the good reviews on this book. I will say that some of the author’s comments are good enough to assist the reader in their own reflection, but most are plain, lacking insight, and feel rushed...and some are just stupid. Take February 8th for example, where the author says “The next time someone gets upset near you - crying, yelling, breaking something, being pointed or cruel - watch how quickly this statement will stop them cold: ‘I hope this is making you feel better.’ Because, of course, it isn’t.” Face palm. There is nothing remotely Stoic about responding with sarcasm to someone who is upset. I like the structure and premise behind the book so much that I keep wanting it to get better. But I can’t help but feel like I’m reading the musings of an amateur.",2
47177,"Moisture and light meter work great! But that’s not what i got it for, I got it for the pH dial, which doesn’t even move. I don’t know if i just got a faulty product, but hopefully i can get a replacement or refund.",2

61500,"The money clip itself it ok. The silver is nice but the initials were wrong. They asked for first initial, last initial then middle initial and they obviously should have put the middle initial in the middle but we got ours as the last letter. The other issue is that you cannot really tell that it's letters. It just looks like a graphic design so wanting your initials on this money clip is a waste of time and money.",2
72696,I’m frustrated because I love this thing but the fabric drawers smell awful.,2

48253,"I like the lashes but I would love them if they would stay on. And, the gel is very dry and not easy to apply. I've only been able to successfully wear them twice. I've thoroughly cleaned them after both uses. Not sure why the gel is so dry. I haven't left the lid off and I cleaned the brush applicator after each use. Disappointing because (1) they're not cheap and (2) I would prefer to use them over lash adhesive but I'm back on the adhesive. Contemplating returning them.",2
50089,Waste of money. Doesn’t get much for channels at all and I’m less than 25 miles from all the local stations. Tried mounting it on every wall and in every window but can’t keep reception on any channel.,2
72389,"I was disappointed when I got my zippers as it stated 100 zippers of 20 different colors, 5 of each color. I received 95 zippers, 19 different colors of 5 each. Also 3 of those zippers were not usable so I really ended up with 92 usable zippers! Is there anything you will do about this issue, would be appreciated!! Thank you! If i would have gotten the right amount I would have been very happy because the colors were great and the length and they seem to be what I need for my purses!!",2
52945,"Overall I like this product- it's why I came back to buy more. However, one of these hoses has sprung a leak somewhere in the middle. It's a fine mist but a leak just the same and I'm not happy. Worried that the others will end up with something similar. WHY can't anyone make a durable, lightweight, dependable hose?!",2
69703,Bought it for my kids room. The cards slide around a lot.,2

129533,"This printer has all of the basic features that most people would need for a home (non-office) printer. It's wireless, easy to set up, and it has just two ink cartridges. Overall, nice to use. I initially reviewed this lower, but upon support from HP Customer Service, realized that my printer was shipped with an ink cartridge that was old / dried out. So the poor printing was simply a bad ink cartridge. My only criticism is that this was clearly aged inventory in Amazon's warehouse - the printer showed with a sale date that was a year ahead of my purchase (and HP nicely updated that with the warranty information) and the ink was close to it's expiration date. But with that fix, it's been a great printer for me.",4
129023,It does cover nicely. The color spots do not really seem to change.,4
151818,Does not really look the same as pictured on the site,4

154216,This was a fun game for myself and granddaughters . Had lots of fun with it,4
123212,"Bag is durable and well padded. It's also big enough for most of my hardware. Some hardware may be too big for the bag without completely disassembling it. It can also get difficult to carry if there's too much in it, or if the sizes of the contents allow the bag to bend. If I upgrade, I will probably go with a longer bag/case with at least one hard side and with wheels.",4
134679,"Nice silverware set. They are shiny and well made and does not seems cheap, although they are a tad lighter than what I have expected and the size of large spoon seems too large for me, but overall a very good set for the price. I like the range of the utensil in the set the box is also pretty good, you can use it as a gift too. Good set, great for the price",4
129021,"Very absorbent and soft and good price, just wish I would’ve gone for a more natural fabric choice that breathes a little better but I just use them at night. Cleans easily.

120532,"Powerful, but too difficult for beginner",4
123183,"This lube is amazing, a little bit goes a long way and the texture and consistency is amazing. It dries a little too fast, but most lubes are like that. The smell is a little funky, kinda smells like a mix of plasitc and strawberries. But overall i would recommend, and i will buy again.",4
120664,Very nice product no issues putting it together. Everything is solid metal. Not sure why anyone would complain about a plastic screw holding the lightning jack. It allows for stand to adjust to your case to fit on to it. Easy enough looks nice. Cords not being built into or power is a plus in my opinion. Easy enough to replace a bad cord in the future.,4
126205,I didn't like it quite as good as the first book but it still had me hooked,4
130219,"Love this wig!! Very little shedding and it very soft. I had to color it and the color turned as very well. Color didn’t take long to reach desired color. I tried using a spray solution of water and conditioner but once it dried, it look dull so I used a spray activator. Curls are nice but I would have preferred them to be a litter looser. Overall it’s a great wig.",4
128477,"A very nice, sturdy messenger bag! Tons of compartments for all your belongings. My iPad and notebooks and folders fit perfectly. The price and style of the bag are win wins!!",4
156083,I actually thought that this was pretty well done. I think these girls may have been naive in their initial expectations but it felt genuine. I think this push/pull between harnessing your sexual power and compromising your personal morals is an important conversation. I also think they displayed an above average consideration of the ramifications of this lifestyle.,4
132869,Satisfied with overall product and timely shipping/packaging. Price was a bit high,4

83090,"I've needed to replace the bumpers in like 5 xbox controllers over the last couple years (intentionally flawed xbox controller design?) and it always seems to mess up the home button, making them hard to press and not spring back like they should. These were not any different. However...These had less extra plastic hanging off of them than the others I've bought, and they didn't show up broken or break during installation. So the home buttons are stiff but the bumpers work again.",3
92674,"It starts out pragmatic and sane. Then, about the 70% through the book, it departs into lofty ideas the author and his wife say actually become reality. And I believe them. However, the source to all they experience is not what they think it is ;-)",3

112607,I have to take it off and clean the insider of the protector and the watch face weekly. I go to the gym everyday and sweat gets behind the protector and interferes with the touch responsiveness. It definitely saves the watch face though.,3
104692,It looks great but I'm super concerned by the smell. I haven't felt confident to put food in it yet. I washed it a few times but it has a strong plastic smell still. What the heck is out-gassing?,3
115828,Didn’t really like the case but only a personal preference issue.,3
106526,It definitely transfers files at a very fast speed for 3.0. And it is definitely capable of fast charging. However it is constantly dinging and connecting and disconnecting every other second if it's ever touched while in use. I have to sit my phone down still on a countertop or something and not hold it in my hand. If I'm trying to transfer a file I need to do that also and just touch the screen gently to not move it or it will completely disconnect and try and reconnect which would ruin any file transfers and progress and will mess up the charging as well. I feel like it's not plugging in deep enough into the phone like the original cable does.,3

85341,"I've wanted to try menstrual cups for a while and finally got one! I was super excited to use it but ran into so many uncomfortable bumps along the way I'm a little timid to use it again. I found the only way I could remove it was while I was laying on my back. I relaxed my muscles as the removal instructions told me when i tried standing up, but even though I could feel the rim it was like it kept slipping out of my reach every time I tried to grip it! This panicked me because I was in public and couldn't just lay on the stall floor to fish it out. Also, the cup seemed to disappear up there the first few days (my cervix height changed which is normal but made the whole removal time a pain). If anything I'll try the soft cup because i did notice slightly uncomfortable pressure on my bladder making it near impossible to use the bathroom. I don't want to give up on saalt though!",3

110726,To seller; Excited to use this product as it was recommended by my stylist. I was disappointed to see that both the shampoo and conditioner had leaked when I opened the box. Amazon didn't give me the option to contact you privately to see how to handle this. Thanks.,3
