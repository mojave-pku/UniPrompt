199658,"I purchased this tracker due to my daughter being a new driver and concerns about her safety. It took seconds to install and I am not a tech wiz. I dowloaded the app to my phone and can also track using my laptop. Within minutes from installation, the tracker synced with the app and I was able to track her car. It allows me to see her speed, received notifications if there is sharp turning or braking, and also provides a history of where she has been. I can get exact coordinates of her location and times which has already come in handy in a big way. We received a call from the police department that there was an accident and the person who was driving hit another vehicle and drove away. The vehicle was similar to my daughter's and she was in the same town when the accident occurred! I was able to pull up the tracking history and see she was not in the same location where the accident occurred at that time through the tracker. Also, her vehicle did not show any damage thankfully. The tracker saved us a lot of hassle and concern. PS She is unaware the tracker is on her vehicle. If for some reason it is removed, we would be notified as well as the unit will send a message that it has been tampered with. Overall, very pleased with this product.",5

180221,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. It was a big update for her gaming rig and really improved her graphics! She said she noticed a big difference. It's been very reliable so far for many weeks of Skyrim (and other gaming).,5
195331,More in the head and less in the shower floor and drainage. I like that this product comes through for me. I have tried a couple other products before but I have never been this content with just a single one. I would absolutely recommend this.,5

171197,Love this product ! Bought it for our upcoming Disney trips as well as the summer since our old one was very bulky and hard to pack. It actually mists not just sprays you with water and the fan is very powerful! Can‚Äôt believe how compact and handy it is - 2 thumbs up!,5
165940,I wish I bought these sooner. I noticed a significant savings in just a month as I used to leave to lights burning 24/7 in the front and back yards.

Took a chance on the small and looked hella amazing in it! My arms felt comfortable, and I was able to keep them on without cutting it like follower customers have stated. Love the fact that you can adjust the top to fit your bust! Quality looks amazing and not cheap either. I‚Äôm critical in attire and I must say this was nice! Buy it.

9733,In December I purchased two LxTek five pack 952XL in anticipation of a planned distribution for a small nonprofit mission group that i work with. After some delay the printed project got underway. When printing began I discovered that only one out of the four 952XL black cartridge was functional. A 75% failure rate is much too high for any product. Unfortunately due to the delays in the project my time for recourse through Amazon Prime also passed. I love the idea of reused/re-manufactured cartridges but there should be some checks on re-usability before marketing.,1

No ice, no nuts, nothing dense. One morning, it began to make funny noises, the blender slowed down, and as I turned it off, it began to smoke and produce a very odd smell. Braun customer service seems to be set up to deny claims. I still don't have a new blender-- they only want to give me the bottom part, but the things that turn the blades are locked up, too.

5685,Not worth a buck. Just awful.,1
29395,"Definitely not what I thought I was getting. It does not cover as much as the pictures show (and I have a short torso), it rolls down, and didn't smooth or flatten anything. Instead it made me look round and pregnant. I ordered a 3X and you can tell they are made for smaller people, not truly for bigger girls that have a little more to smooth out. Very disappointed.",1
30774,Horrid product. So disappointed that I chose this over a new iPad. iBooks (iPad) Have much better features and you don't have to deal with crappy advertising blasted all over the home screen as the fire tablet apparently does. Bought another for gift and am embarrased to give it now.,1

They lasted 2 days. Very disappointed.",2
60188,Order at least one size up. Material is cheap. Stiff and you can't take photos or type emails as advertised.,2
65554,I hate to review anything especially when I have received it a few hours back. Two stars because the packaging is either very poor or I have received an open package. That too one day later than what was promised.,2
48149,"These are HUGE! My 2 1/2 year old wears an 8, but they are fitting snug. I ordered a size 9 (double checked their size chart), and they are HUGE. See pics for comparison (you can see the 8 and 9 imprinted on each shoe).",2

66584,"You get what you pay for with this record player. Turntable itself feels light and made of a thin metal. The arm is metal which is nice but the lever to adjust the needle height dosnt work, causing the needle to fall on its own. It assembles easily and plays out of the box. At lower volumes it sounds good with the included speakers but at higher volumes it falls apart, so I would only suggest to use it in smaller rooms. Also out of the box one of the speakers play much quieter than the other, after switching them and getting new wires nothing seems to work, and with no balance control on the system I may need to get new speakers all together. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this record player, all in all very cheaply made, can‚Äôt imagine it will withstand the long term",2
55363,Returned. Daughter didn‚Äôt like them,2
66870,Not what I expected ... but I gave it as a gift,2
76796,With all the great reviews I thought this would be a great bath bomb. Instead I found these had little to no scent to them at all. They don't fizz very well either. They do have some moisturizing ability and some do change the water colors but it can't make up for the lack of scent in these things.,2
63374,"Tasted very average, I think. The chocolate arrived in good shape, not smashed or leaking. The chocolate was very dark, but I was expecting something really indulgent, different, and yummy for the price. It didn't really taste buttery or indulgent.. I was disappointed.",2

I have had my 4th generation iPad since 2012 and it has always been in mint condition... until I got this cover with the keyboard. I discovered a crack on my screen this morning, and I'm pretty bummed. I've never dropped my iPad and am super gentle with it. If my iPad was newer, I'd be much more upset - but I'm just upset that I bought this cover and now my screen is cracked. I can only guess that it's because of the keyboard and no cushion in between the screen and the frame of the keyboard? Who knows.",2
77335,I did not expect this to be such ridiculously flimsy plastic: it‚Äôs like something you‚Äôd get in a pack fir birthday favors. Not high quality and in my opinion both with nearly $12.,2

I have a 400 mbS internet speed from my provider, my phone is steady at 320 mbs speed and laptop does not exceed 200 mbs speed, so, my phone is faster than the laptop. I tried getting help from Dell since at first it didn't exceed 49 mbs and they helped me get to 200, then they turned me over to the software department which sold me a package of $150, service and software. After almost 2 hours with them on phone and laptop they actually slowed my speed even more and then admitted that the laptop does not have the capacity to go any faster, I was fuming. BOTTOM LINE... NOT WORTH THE MONEY",2

154485,Great product to replace grill cleaning brushes with metal that fall off and cause medical issues. A little hard to keep clean.,4
124385,They are beautiful. The only problem is that I pay 3 times more than their price to blow them.,4
140405,Works great. It came with metal shavings so I cleaned it out be wary when you first use it. Otherwise I'm very satisfied with the product it's what I expected which is great.,4

153591,"So far so good. I bought this to attach to my pack and play for my twins. Definitely does the job. It has 3 modes: on, off, on no music. I gave 4 stars because it must be attached to a hard part of the pack and play. If I try to tighten it on the fabric side, it cannot grip with the weight of the mobile causing it to hang down wayyy to close to baby. Not really a big deal, works fine if you attach to hard area.",4
121657,"These are nice sheets, They washed well and didn't really look wrinkled after drying but they do wrinkle once used on the bed like most other sheets. Still a nice set they are soft and have a nice feel to them. They fit my foam mattress good without slipping off. Would recommend.",4
142611,I LOVED how easy it was to put this together. Usually my husband and I cannot be in the same room after we put furniture together this was a breeze. The only problem was that the king size frame was just a tad to small for the mattress so we just put the little part that doesn't fit at the head so it's not as noticable.,4

148230,"It is a great toy and definitely gets the job done. The material is top notch and allows you to control the level of suction. The only reason I gave it 4 starts is because the massage pattern inside could be better. Wish it had more patterns available, like they do for their other products. However, it is great for the price. (Easy clean up, my girlfriend loves that).",4

152982,There OK for the money,4
154683,"First off, I didn't love the smell. It wasn't bad but it reminded me of something that's medicated. I was disappointed with the size of the bottle thinking that it won't last long but I only needed a small dime size to get a good lather. After drying my hair, it felt so soft and silky. I don't think it's because I changed to a different shampoo because I do that pretty regularly so that I don't get buildup from the same product. I haven't used it long enough to see if it would help with my hair loss yet. I'll update when I run out.",4
127551,Kind of wanted it to extend forward a bit more but it does a good job of holding my lights,4

132626,"I have a young, year old cat who loves this toy. Often before bed, I toss it around, and I love the exercise he gets. I noticed he sleeps better, as well. Sometimes, I attach two of the feather bunches. One that is soft and fluffy, and the other type that is thinner and more rigid. He loves the combo. I can't fault the company for the beating the feathers take, as he is pretty rough with it. However, my frustration has been with the wand. The first one I had lasted about six months before it had issues. The second one didn't even last a month, so now I am on my third one in two months. I am giving this third one a try, and if I have the same issue, I will start looking at a competitor. I really do like the quality of the feather, which makes this choice difficult. I do have to give props for the price, if it were more expensive, I would have already gone to a competitor.",4

Remove the white paper from decal and place the decal on your desired location use credit card to smooth out and peel transfer paper off making sure your letters are flat.

The picture on amazon looks like it should match my Penn perfectly, but when I received it, it was way more orange gold than pale gold like a Penn.

Works how advertised but I couldn‚Äôt get the remote (which was bigger than I expected) to work until I charged everything fully for a few hours, i does have an indicator light and flashes while charging , I had to sorta plug the dc cable in just right and move it around so that I could make full contact in order for it the charge ( took me about a day to get this thing fully charged ) . Very soft and smooth texture , The head swivels in a circular motion which I didn‚Äôt even know it did, but not to be too graphic it just isn‚Äôt strong enough to do that while it‚Äôs in use , not a very powerful vibration either but it is quiet . It was an ok buy .",3

81532,"These turtles were good, but no better than the ones that you can get in the store for a lot less. They do NOT have real Tortuga Rum in them. It is artificial rum flavor... and it TASTES artificial too.",3
111314,"If you are using a console, and if you have a microphone headset, you need the cable. however those cables are so cheaply made that after a week it would no longer show mic or game volume is being put onto the pc. The software is a bit weird as well but it isn't really clunky.",3

102619,Have not used it because it is a birthday present for someone.,3
82648,"Quality of the book was good. Only some of the information had details regarding the different oils, the rest was referencing products made by Young Living. I was hoping for more recipes than just product references. It is more a training book for a Young Living representative to sell their products.",3

80731,"I was really disappointed by this stuff. Some reviews said it was great for fine hair, but unfortunately, it made my very fine hair greasy and weighed it down. I‚Äôve used a very small amount and tried it for a few weeks, but it just isn‚Äôt working for me. It would probably be ok for semi-fine hair, but my search for a shine and anti-frizz product that works on truly super fine hair continues!",3

91025,Strong magnets. You'll need to order spice labels if you use Indian spices. One big problem is the wall mounting system. I needed to drill 2 holes and mount to cabinet as the sliding mount provided is not secure.,3
107481,So these shorts are not cut like the pictures. The leg opening is oblong from side to side. Not front to back. So you dont get that natural stretch on the side. Instead it kinda flares out. Not really flattering. The material is soft and super stretchy. I'm debating to keep it.,3
83499,I have read all the wonderful books in this family but I'm sad to say that this one was just good not great. What happened to dialogue between the couple - most of the relationship was in their thoughts not in what they said. What happened to bringing in the family members and the fun of their dialogue. What happened to make the heroine such a whiner - the constant I'm not good enough. Not to mention the contradictions on what's said in ome chapter such as the great mother that leaves her son alone overnight by himself while shes on a date. The Male characters had the alpha attitude these books are known for and that saves the book.,3

107767,"Very cute, but very low quality. Ordered this for a birthday gift for my niece. She had it a week and I was embarrassed to find out the seams are already coming apart in several spots. I don‚Äôt recommend this prouduct. Very disappointed with this purchase!",3
114035,"Perfect case except fingerprints and smudges appear constantly, no matter how clean my hands are. The one downside of the satin smooth plastic and dark color options.",3
113245,"Not exaclty what I was expecting. Works fine, but too bulky for me.",3
118957,"These are great, unless you use oil in your hair. They do last longer than any other brand I‚Äôve tried so far. I wish they were clear instead, but cute colors.",3
