84660,"I’m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn’t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn’t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don’t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.",3

72272,"The leg openings are a little small, but other than that the suit fits nicely, and is high quality material. Edit: I have been wearing this for less than two months and it is 100% worn out. It has worn so thin in multiple spots that it’s no longer appropriate for wearing in public, I have to throw it away. This is unacceptable.",2
65426,Well it’s looks and feels okay but it most certainly does not have 4 pockets that’s a lie it has 3 so that’s pretty messed up to say it has 4 when it’s only 3 the fabric is super stiff hopefully after washing it will be better,2
74456,"Side buttons are now much harder to click, and camera cutout on the back is not a precise cut, there is about a mm of space left between the case and the camera module",2
48710,"I expected more for what I paid for this. The long part of the frame doesn’t sit even at the middle, so it appears to bow. The photo I included shows the top of the frame against the box, for straight edge reference. It does the job, and I needed to get this photo framed for a project I needed finished tomorrow. Next time I’ll get an assembled, wood or metal frame.",2
158154,Really cute mug. I would have given 5 stars if it were a bit bigger.,4
134858,"Fairly thick material, so the poncho should be good for multiple uses. It's VERY large, so if you're small in size don't expect it to be fashionable. I'm 5'3"" and it covers me from head to calf. Definitely gets the job done in keeping you covered.",4

9447,"It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.",1
