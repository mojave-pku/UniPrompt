96394,"Bought for my husband, he's a size large. Unfortunately, the fit around the arm is pretty tight. The rest fits true to size. He still wears it hoping it will stretch. Its a nice shirt, feels soft, I'd recommend buying a size up just in case.",3
93624,I absolutely love this high chair. The print is adorable and it is so lightweight it's perfect for a small house. My only complaint was the cover was not removable so when my son's diaper leaked on the non wipeable part of the fabric I had to cut and sew the cover to ensure that it was removable. Safety belts still come through and my son is still secure and I don't have to worry about gross stains where he eats. I'm not sure who thought non removable was a good idea for a high chair.,3

This one has a lip separator for each pill box which is a lot more difficult for my mom. The other box allowed you to slide the pill box in place. It is okay for the normal person, but not if vision impaired. Also the lid doesn't close down flat unless you click it closed.",3
102434,"It's exactly what I excepted it to be. However, I just want to state a suggestion/improvement to the product. It would be nice if you have a quantity of 4 sets of legs. That way you could use an extra set to raise your stand a little higher. So I will have 2 spare plastic platforms and 2 outfitted with all the legs. I needed to raise my monitor just a tad more than what was provided. So, I ordered another one just so I can raise my other stand.",3
92390,"Ok read... fun little book, and easy to read. Not sure I can give it more than 3 stars simply because those attracted to its message will have come to it for a purpose of sorts.

100737,"The first one I bought didn’t fit right so I purchased another, still no luck. The material is fine and they are the cutest thing ever. The problem is the leg area was too big.

99971,I like the layout of the days in the board and it fits my refrigerator fine. Those are the good points. The bad points are that only 2 of the round magnets actually function. The markers write but won't stay in the board with their magnets (plus they don't mark very well). Overall I'm happy with the board but the accesories are fairly useless. My advice is that if you need accessories don't count on these and be prepared to get some from another source.,3

Eventually he learns that Ven might not be mentally stable and that she would do anything to keep Brandon in her life for financial stability. So, he tries to stay away from her to save his marriage. The story is more focused on bringing the dark side of the Asian culture and in such a way that people who truly appreciate it may feel offended.

It feels like a most of it is held together with glue similar to cyanoacrylate, which doesn't have much flex /impact resistance, without using screws. For the price, I would have liked to see an extra gasket, or at least for the one supplied to have been thicker. It is honestly pretty thin, which seems like it would be more prone to tearing. Also, it's not going to provide much cushion against the rigid edge of the polycarbonate main cylinder which, by design, will be pressing firmly against the body. My final gripe with this is that again, for the price point, this really should have been USB rechargeable; not even including a couple of AAA's just seems downright cheap, on the manufacturer's part.",3

I have a pretty high pain tolerance so I can stand it for a couple minutes. Now for the good: It does work. My lips stay plumped for about 2-3 hours.

I'm skinny and weigh 140 lbs and the chair has just enough space to fit me. The padding is not soft but im not expecting anything more considering its price.

If I keep it inside that range, it works Ok. Second, the sound Quality is not bad, but not so Good. The speaker is not too loud and it doesn't provides that Home Cinema Theater experience I was expecting. If everything around is quite, I can have a decent sound. Third, the battery life is good enough. Fourth and last, the Price is too high considering what I mentioned before. For this price I would be expecting a decent, strong BT Connection and a louder volume sound. Bottom line, it would be a good shopping if the price gets cheaper.",3

The reason I'm holding back from 5 stars is that the neck cord does get a little bit awkward at times, but more importantly the bluetooth range is really problematic. I've been using the headphones for about 4 days now, and half the time when I slip my phone into my front jeans pocket (a totally normal place for the phone to go), the audio on the Porta Pros starts stuttering. Take the phone back out, audio clears up immediately. I don't have this problem with multiple pairs of Bose bluetooth headphones, nor with Apple AirPods - each of these maintain an unbroken audio connection even when my phone is clear across the room.

90676,"We do not have a specific complaint about this product. There is no indication that it is anything other than what it claims to be. After replacing the screen, the iPhone 6 Plus became nonfunctional but that is NOT the fault of the product in any way. Everything an experienced expert needs is provided. Instructions are a bit unclear due to translation challenges, we believe. We resorted to a recommended video to augment the printed instructions. Even though we followed instruction carefully step by step, and were successful in replacing the screen, some step was not done correctly. OUR EARNEST advice is this, The operation of replacing the screen is not a DIY project. It takes experience to overcome those steps that do not go as smoothly or easily as the instructions say or as multitude of video seem to demonstrate. There will be something that is not exactly the way it is presented and there will be some connection that will not be able to be removed and replaced as easily as one is led to believe. Again, there is nothing wrong with this product. There are a couple of things better than any video showed but the overall procedure requires some expertise we did not have - obviously, since we now have an iPhone 8 Plus and the 6 Plus is simply a repository of data for us to collect through a WiFi connection if necessary.",3

170887,"This little compressor really has power. I was looking for something to keep in the trunk that ensures you can always pump up a car tire. This thing is pretty small for what it can do. It is easy to operate and if you know the tire pressure you need, you set it and turn it on and it shuts off when that psi is reached. The cords are long enough and the case it comes in was an added bonus that I wasn't expecting (I may have missed that in the description). We plan to use it to blow up pool floats as well since it has the little attachments for those or for balls. Very happy with this purchase for a great price.",5

I bought the 2 large storage tree bags to break down my 9' tree and separate it into two bags so there would be no capacity issue. The handles may be heavy duty reinforced, but the remaining stitching of the bag is worthless. My tree comes in 4 parts. I put the middle two sections in one bag, zippered the bag and the seam split. The bottom section (largest and heaviest part of the tree) and the very top of the tree (smallest part) fit nicely in one bag, however when I went to zipper it up, one of the zippers fell off. I was glad there was a zipper on the other end of the bag to close it properly. I was not very happy with the product and I specifically bought two so I would not have this seam rip issue. To have the zipper just fall of the end of the other bag without even trying to close it was very disappointing.",1
22560,"We originally ordered these in Nov 2017. The bags were awesome and we never had one break or tear. So when we started running low in March of this year, I made sure to order the exact same product. We did not need to open the second box until a couple weeks ago. I knew something was wrong when I pulled out the very first bag. The plastic was different and it didn't have any ""give"" to it. Needless to say, every single one of them has ripped so far and over very stupid reasons. The corner of an Oreo bag made a 6 in tear and all I did was pick the trash bag up to move it 5 feet away. We are 10 for 10 on damaged trash bags. The worst part... We have a lot of cats. Several times now the torn bags have spilled dirty cat litter all over the floor.",1

It looks nice on my counter and serves its purpose. Updated review: Ok so the salt cellar that did not break during shipping pretty much shattered at the lightest touch after 3 weeks on my counter. I can no longer recommend this item, clearly they are not very durable at all.",1

As other mentioned, the glass is extremely thin and feels like it will crack at any point. The metal cover doesnt sit securely on the glass and it feels like there should be another piece holding the metal to the glass, otherwise if you lift the lid, the entire contraption lifts up. If the teapot is anywhere 3/4 full or more - watch out because it will leak no matter how hard you try. It feels like the good reviews either received another item or are fake.",1

Dialog didn't continue, descriptions faltered, and why? Because every other page was missing. When I checked the other books in the bundle, the same thing occurred. Unfortunately, there's no way that I can find to complain about this to anyone at Amazon. I tried re-downloading, but as I 'm in the midst of another bundle (and this is the first time this has happened since I bought the kindle) I haven't checked to see what's what yet.

The first time the cutter was finally used was after any return period, and the extender measuring arm was glued at its base, so it could not be opened without breaking the connecting plastic.

Once Walmart obtained inventory I bought it, dumped the Pennington seed and replaced with Walmart product. Birds are again happy feeders Pennington seed now in garbage.",1

386,"Ummm, no.....the ends of the rings are sharp, once you open the ring a little to put it in it's a major pain in the *** to squeeze it back closed, and the color on the colored ones is like a film of some sort that peels off (while I am wearing it!) if I wear it for more than about 24 hours (this was very embarrassing!). The one, and only one, plus for them is no skin reaction of any kind. Hence the 1 star. So again, NO....sorry, don't waste your time or money unless of course you like doing that sort of thing (NOT!).",1

I cleaned it off and realized that the suction cup was not made of the usual rubbery material but just soft plastic and could never have provided complete seal for suction. So some body must have screwed up in the design or manufacturing process and decided to work around it with glue! Well, look at the picture and you can see the result. It is a piece of trash now.",1

I may send them back or ask for a refund because they suck.",1

15063,"I don't leave reviews. But after this robot toppled down my massive staircase AGAIN I feel like I should. This vac does not work on carpeting of any kind, low pile or not. It does not even have a brush system on the bottom, simply a hole for dirt and dust to go in. The 2 bristles on the sides? Destroyed after FOUR uses. With only one backup set in the box. My entire house is hardwood except for 2 large thin low pile rugs which this thing doesn't even clean. And the intelligent ""sensors"" that prevent it from hitting walls is BS. It literally runs full speed into walls and then stumbles for a second once the bumper is hit, moves an inch to the side and runs into the wall again. Look at the pictures of paint scraping off, that was before the stair carnage. 1st time I used it the damn thing stayed under my kitchen table for 20+ minutes despite me pulling all the chairs out. The manual makes no sense and is written in gibberish. The dust bin is literally TOO BIG for it's suction power. After 2 90 minute runs only then is the dust bin over half full and it seems to only really pick up hair. I want a refund.",1

17347,"It my own fault for not looking more closely, I just assumed it was the same design as the Apple sport band but it’s totally different. See the photo attached- the black band is the official Apple one. The main thing is just that the peg points inward toward your wrist and is uncomfortable. It’s also awkward to put on since you’re trying to pull the male end toward the female instead of the other way around. The holes are slightly too small for the peg and you really have to force it. Pretty disappointing, but like I said it’s really my own fault for not looking closer at the pictures.",1

28581,"I initially loved this armband however there is one very GIANT flaw: the way it connects is not via a magnet, but rather 2 small little clips that hold the metal square which have indentations on the sides. The problem is, if running or moving your arms in any way, the fit is not snug and the weight of the phone (I have an iphone 7) pulls the metal up and away from the backplate and it makes a clicking noise...with every single arm movement. It is driving me crazy! If that small circle in the center is actually a magnet, it is not nearly strong enough to do anything with real movement. If it had a powerful magnet that would actually keep the 2 metal pieces from separating, it would be great. Very bummed. I bought a new case just to be able to use this (my old case was textured and thus it wouldn't adhere). One other thing that bothers me is constantly having the metal square on the back on the phone. It's slippery when you put the phone down face up and any gripping quality of your case is irrelevant, unless you put your phone facedown and can't see the screen. And, pressing the home button while flat on a table and the phone tips/rocks, which is also just an annoyance to be aware of.",1

Literally kinks just by pulling it out. I am returning this hose and buying a hose that is more than twice the price of this one - and 30' shorter! Hoping that 'more money' doesn't equal 'more problems' in this scenario. I, for one, am completely done buying these multi-ply hoses. I am going to invest more in heavy duty, all rubber hoses, and hope that they last longer than a month! Any hose brand that claims ""never kink"" - either in the product title or product description, is a liar - and most likely, their hose kinks worse than any hose you've ever owned!

The thing was very heavy and I was not about to attempt to find a box to put it in to return (as the box it came in had to be completely destroyed to get this out as they had taped and stapled all the pieces to the inside of the box) so we just put that corner in the back and used some extra long deck screws to try to pull them together as best we could. I emailed Suncast and have yet to hear a response after over 2 months so that was not a mark in their favor either.

I was hoping this would be like the Sesame Street I remember (not completely Elmo-centric, but very kid friendly with lots of Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Grover, Ernie and Bert, etc..). It's not. It's like a mix between sketch comedy and some educational bits. Interesting to see how the show originated and to see life in the 1970s, but not what I was looking for and not what I remember from the 80s. Also, each disc only has one full episode. And the disc starts with a warning that it's for adults and not appropriate for today's preschoolers.

If you are listening to music, this works well. It has extended base that will give music some additional punch. Unfortunately, my requirements is geared for communications rather music. When I first installed this, it took a while for the BT to connect but once it did it was faster the next time. If I listened to music and had a call come in, the BT dropped off, sometimes it would drop off and then picked back up several times before it stayed on. I would have to say ""hello"" 3 to 4 times before the person on the other end could hear me. One of my trucks is a diesel, the noise canceling was NOT up to par, others couldn't hear me over the engine. I would pull over and shut the engine down to continue the conversation which negates the reason I bought this device. I would then hear the person on the other end but they would fade in and out.

60656,"I want to give this a 5 star review but simply can't because it's HUGELY flawed. The big flaw here is how your GoPro (etc) mounts. It mounts just fine but you can't properly fit the thumb screw in place. The more you tighten it, the hard it is to tighten because it hits the frame of the light. I can't believe they were able to even sell this the way it is, it's that bad. That said, without enough work (and a screw driver) you can tighten it down but make sure the housing for your GoPro will stay with this light permanently because having to unscrew and re-screw it would be a huge pain. Dedicate a GoPro case/holder/frame/housing (whatever it's called) just to this and it becomes better. The other issue is that the battery doesn't last long. A few hours probably but that's not long. The charger blinks orange and green while charging so you'd think it would turn green when done, right? Nope, blinks orange and green forever regardless. So you just have to charge it for hours or overnight and assume it's fully charged, and hope it is. The light itself is amazing. If they'd fix these MAJOR flaws this is easily a 4 star light and works greast with my GoPro Hero 7 Black.",2

I listen at work for almost a full 8 hours straight while working. These, don't even get me through a full work day. I'm disappointed in them and sad I wasted the money. I'll probably go back to using my bulky earphones and saving these for emergencies only.

I contacted BLU about this and tried of few of their steps to solve the issue and eventually had to send out the phone. After 5 weeks I got my phone back and tested it, again I was not able to receive calls. I should mentions that I tested the sim card on my LG and everything worked fine. so I contacted BLU again and told them I was still having issues, after jumping through the same hoops with hard reset etc. they finally agreed that my phone might be faulty.

But the level, according to the Zero water meter has decreased by 150 since placing in service. The original filter lasted 3 weeks. The first replacement filter lasted 9 days, and clogged on the 7th day. Same for the second. The third filter has been in used for 23 hours and the meter already indicates 1. This is after only one fill up of the 30 cup container. Zero water support did not want me talking to their quality control or development sections. They also said when the filter clogs you remove it beat rapidly on it, then reinstall at which point you will see bubbles from the trapped air being released. Again this was not so. I never saw any bubbles and the filters failed within 24 hours of preforming this procedure. They also said no difference between filter provided with the product and replacements, yet the results demonstrate there is a big difference in quality. When you call customer service the canned announcement states if you do not want to wait press #1 leave your name, contact information and a Customer Rep will call you back. I used this option twice and I never did receive a callback. The majority of customer reps I spoke with, including their supervisor who was exceptionally rude and condescending. Added info: The fourth filter clogged almost immediately. Only one 10 glass of water ran through and it clogged.

The writing felt rushed and amateur, the story felt way too quick and the insta-love was a huge turn off. It also iust kind of felt gross (Spoiler below) Nic sleeps with Elle without a condom, without ever telling her that hes a ""male escort"" who regularly sleeps with his clients. That to me just screams yuck, and I thought it was incredibly disrespectful. Beyond that the entire story kind of leads up to her finally finding out hes a male escort and it was not even an exciting climax. She gets told and is like ""oh I feel so stupid, I should have known."" Should have known? Who in their right mind would ever expect that? And then all he does is apologize and says he loves her after literally 4 dates of straight lying to her and shes like ""oh he loves me? Hes so sexy I cant resist!"" Like really? Have some self respect! Then shes more appalled that hes never done oral with a client then anything else. This book fell completely flat, honestly wish I could get my money back. I skipped the last 2 chapters because the whole thing was just completely ridiculous. Disappointed for sure, hope Kendall Ryan's next release is nothing like this one.",2

If you don't ensure the hot side dissipates its heat efficiently, the entire cooler will get very hot, rendering it worthless.",2

In the picture it looks like it suppose to be super bright but it's not. I light weight and I was able to use it during the day because you can see it pretty well without the light on. Just the color of the wand is bright but the lights is horrible. I would not recommend this light unless you don't have that much money.

No one at dinner had completed reading the book except the member who chose the book. She explained its significance in the evolution of sci-fi and some of the plot so I picked it back up. The incredible journey of the two main characters across the ice that also leads them to understand each other is truly epic. I read for pleasure and escape. This book while worthwhile required a lot of effort.,2

The thought that you can put the pads under the rear rollers and slide back into position (as per the instructions) is a farce. Between the weight of the fridge, and the rubber of the pads, they simply do not slide on the floor. At all. They sit put and the rollers simply roll right over the small top lip of the pad. I even tried to oil the floor, hoping they would glide on a slick surface. No, Ended up having to place the fridge in place, and with the aid of a helper, tilt it forward and push the rear pads into place with a stick while looking under the fridge with a flashlight. Then (much easier), tilting the fridge backwards and placing the front pads in place. Bottom line is this... they do seem to work well, but installing them was a pain in the neck. Almost too much so.",4

Put together dresser, desk, nightstand and other apt items no problem. Cons: needs a multi blade small hand saw had to buy one separately. Also doesn’t come with basic screws/nails for hanging pictures or any electrical or duct tape. Adjustable wrench would also be a plus. All in all a decent set for the price.

157049,"This is a lovely set of 10 fancy fashion doll dresses for 11.5 inch dolls. The dresses are handmade with Velcro closures, and in random colors and styles. I like that they fit both newer and older style barbie dolls, and that the Velcro closures make them easy to put on and remove. They are of decent quality and the assortment I received is very nice, without any repeats, although four dresses do have the same bottom lace. I had to trim a couple of threads that were sticking out but nothing major, and the Velcro closures feel quite strong. I received the following dresses in my set: 1 red dress with lots of lace and a bow with hearts on the top, 1 dress with a white top and layered ruffles in purple, pink, and blue, 3 blue dresses, 1 with multi-colored metallic droplets covering the dress, 1 with a bow around the waist and pink dotted lace, 1 with a neck ruffle and pink and white floral lace, 1 white dress with silver butterfly wings on the top, 2 purple dresses with different styles of lace trim on the top, and pink and white floral lace on the bottom, and lastly 2 pink dresses, 1 with lace and darker pink on the top, and pink and white floral lace on the bottom, and 1 with sequined ruffles.

This is good seller and you have nothing to lose by trying this product. If it works, then that's awesome. If not, you can get a refund. That being said, this product did not help our dog.

I used the old snap rings, shim, and nut. The splash guards inside the wheel well and the front of the engine needed to be removed, to get at the compressor from below. A number of the plastic clips broke and needed replacing. The A/C Compressor didn't need to be removed, but needed to be unbolted from the engine to create space to remove the pulley and coil. Needed a fairly narrow set of 8"" external snap ring pliers to remove the coil. 6"" didn't get deep enough, adjustable square nose pliers didn't have enough space to open.

125386,I can’t mark anything for durability yet bc I’ve only had it a few days. But the case exceeded my expectations when I was searching for a soft jelly like feel type of case. I went with the softer more pastel yellow. Which is incredibly cute but I should have went with more of a mustard for my personal style. The open front case made for easy installation. Previous cases similar in the past are all jelly like silicone through and through. This one caught my attention as soon as I opened the package due to the back part which my phone sits on is lined with a thin layer of suede or a suede like material. This has been the best case I’ve gotten for my iPhone. If you have a tempered screen then the jelly case is the perfect amount of protection. I will look into more colors and variety and will definitely look at this seller first.,4

143676,It’s light weight but big enough to hold a small wallet and your phone,4
145911,This complete is overall very nice and for a beginner deck is it honestly the best price. But I have to say that out of the five I’ve bought before this one had trucks that could not be used. The trucks did not even have grooves on them for the wheels nut to screw on too. This was very disappointing but has only happened to me once.,4

153070,"Not bad, pretty efficient when you replace the pad the it comes with, with filter floss. I have a 7.5 gallon planted cube and this thing is a lot bigger than I thought. Takes up a lot of space in the back corner of my tank. But I don't plan on leaving this in the tank all the time. I'm only going to use it when start to see a light film on the water surface. It's not asthetically pleasing, but that's just personal preference. Overall, it's a good affordable product that does what it's supposed to do. I wouldn't use it for anything bigger than a 15 gallon tank though. Pros: - works as intended - quiet - clear housing, so you can see what has accumulated inside without having to take it apart. - easy setup and maintenance - adjustable flow rate Cons: - filter pad needs to be replaced (not a deal breaker) - not asthetically pleasing in nano planted tank - the wire is a little short - the plastic material doesn't feel as durable as other brands, so I would handle with care during maintenance. But only time will tell if can hold up.",4

Both keyboard and mouse travel well so I like that, but there doesn't appear to be a power switch on the mouse, and that would be handy. Also the DEL key is in a different spot then what I'm used to, so that took a bit to get accustomed to. The keyboard sometimes skipped a beat but I re positioned the dongle to a spot closer to the keyboard and that seem to cure that issue.",4

I love that these make it easier to see how much product I have left and also get every last bit of product These are also significantly more hygienic than the jars and bottles than my items originally came in.

The only complaint I have is the pens held on the left side of the portfolio dig into the legal pad when its closed. Not a big deal, but at least one page on my legal pad is not usable when I open it up. This could be easily remedied on my part, just haven't figured out how to do so yet.

139231,"Excellent product for the price. I wish I had a good work bench to mount this to because I did sets of sights holding it in my hands; yes it can be done! I gave this four out of five stars only because of two things. 1. Does the handle bar slide left and right, because it didn’t for me (maybe I should have tried harder). This exacerbated the issue of me needing the pusher to be further in to rotate the handle. 2. Needing a bit more height on the rear sight mover and possibly a deeper mover. To explain, I was mounting rear sights onto a red dot plate , this was only slightly problematic. Once I had those mounted I needed to mount the plate to the pistol. First, I needed to have the pusher only engage the plate, not the sights which are suppressor height (needing more depth or height in the pusher). The height of the pusher negated me mounting the plate properly and I had to remove the slide and manually mount. Perhaps mounting the plate first would have been more workable but I was using the already mounted sights as a point of reference. One other thing to add, perhaps tick marks on the pusher instead of just on the frame (they are small and harder for me to reference than if they were on both to help with centering). All and all, this is a good quality tool for at home or even shop use, time will tell as I use it more.",4

132174,"4 stars... and i'll tell you why. Negative: The bar was not fully coated with the black rust resistant spray, there were small parts at the knurling that had silver/iron streaks where it was not fully coated. Positive: Structurally solid!! Comes oil sprayed for rust prevention, knurling on this bar is superb! Grips better than any curl bar i've ever used. Feels heavier than most curl bars i've lifted at the gym, which I like! I really dig the fist decal, doesn't seem cheap. As I'm writing this review I see that the GOPLUS black coated curl bar is out of stock and its only showing the chrome one. OVERALL: Worth buying! Just not having the knurling fully coated in black was a tad disappointing, but I know this bar will last years to come!",4

At this size, I think 1440p is really the right resolution - 1080p is a stretch for text (especially if you're using a high dpi second screen). If you're watching videos, it doesn't really matter.

144776,"There have been previous Bluetooth earphones that I have bought that always had some downsides, like battery consumption, Bluetooth range is weak, sound quality is distorted, etc. But, these earphones have solved that problem, but there's a feature on these earphones that I wish it had like the previous ones I owned before. Thr first thing that I like about these earphones is that it doesn't come off as easily when I am sweating or even just running. The previous ones I had these hardships and thankfully, these fix those problems. Another thing that I like about these earphones is the Bluetooth range is actually stronger than the ones I had before and even when I cover my hand on the side that has the Bluetooth receiver, it doesn't cut off the sound. Also, there is a case and my previous headphones didn't have a case. In that case (no pun intended), my previous headphones didn't have protection and they will break easily. But there is one gripe I have, which I mentioned before, which is not having a functional Play/Pause button. Whenever I press the button on the side of the earphones, it won't pause or play music. But, when I hold it to get my voice assistant and then press it once, it works. So, I hope this issue get solved once there's another version of these.

143139,I do like these but I would say that it’s really hard to get the suppository out of the mold. I feel like it bruises my fingers,4
151295,"A lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but it gets the job done and looks pretty good too (that’s what she said).",4
141642,Had to make a couple of passes on some chip bags and it can be hard to get the edges but overall not bad,4
126097,"The box works great. But I wish the grate that filtered the sand was smaller to catch the smaller pieces, those slip through and don’t get cleaned out unless I take a scoop to the litter. And the usable area is very small. I have two little kittens and even though I got the biggest box, it is still on the smaller side. But they still use it.",4
129708,Engaging fleshed out characters. An enjoyable book for a romance. Head and shoulders above other writers in the romance genre.,4
126778,"Loved the story but it lost steam at the end. I wasn't as enthralled with the ancillary characters this time, but it was still fun.",4
159343,I enjoyed the book. I take on board the positive way one should look at seemingly negative experiences dumped on one by other people. Defining and finding happiness through gratitude made sense and I have experienced what he says on occasions where I have focused on gratitude. Some of his shared experience in failed goals empathise with what I have experienced and has helped me to have the correct attitude. I have highlighted some passages that I will continue to refer to in my change process.,4
157103,"I love this sweater. Perfect everyday sweater, I ordered the pink. Nice, soft color. I would have given this sweater 5 stars, but I am concerned the fabric may pick easily.",4
132336,"It's exactly as pictured, good quality and everything. I'm just bummed there's only 4.",4
155153,"Not a bad pillow but not best for nursing. Too soft and middle sags a bit. 1st few months are so hard, I'd reccomend looking into ""My Brest Friend"" for a nursing pillow. If i knew i probably wouldn't have bought this pillow being someone low on money. However, i do plan to use the pillow for tummy time and to help baby sit up. I think that's a better use for this pillow. Also I'd reccomend buying protective cover. With spit up, diaper leaks, etc it's worth the $10 extra. Lastly i do think this pillow is a bit overpriced but not totally unhappy with the purchase.",4
150793,OMG isn't Darius hot! I'm gonna purchase the rest of the series as I'm itching to know how Selena handles it all.,4
128988,Good story but the last 40 pages were out of order so as I read it I really had to think how the story needed to be understood. It certainly was confusing. Wish the publisher had proof read this before printing.,4
133393,"Sweet romance and the beginning of a series. Chet is the oldest of six brothers, he has sacrificed for his family. He meets Christy a veterinarian that recently moved into town and it was almost an immediate connection. I enjoyed this book and recommend it.",4
124401,Smaller than I expected but it works and its cute.,4
147494,Didn't do anything else,4
148567,The Clara Andrews books are such fun – now with the incredible character of Janie the mother-in-law who is more like a troubled teenager in the house. The characters and plot are so intriguing you can picture these being made into a chick-flic movie!,4
150582,It was a gift for my fiance. She loved it.,4
135965,Cute because it's minions....,4
144423,"I wouldn't use this kind of lock to secure a bicycle in my city, which has a very efficient bike theft culture. But it's perfect for tying my trashcan to the railing so it doesn't blow away in the wind. (Note: this works best if the handle is molded out of the same piece of plastic as the body of the can, instead of being an attached piece)",4
141714,"I like the vest very much, especially the extra pockets.",4
133105,Had a few problems but they are willing to help solve the issue other than that very soft and costumer service is very important,4
146482,Comfortable and cool soft fabric. Top is a little snug.,4
143432,Inflates very quickly but takes FOREVER to deflate. It is.comfortable.,4
121867,it cover the land that i have and it smells good,4
