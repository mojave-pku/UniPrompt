The iPad keeps slipping out of the top part of the case, unless the case is propped up perfectly on a flat/level surface (a problem that both of my boys have w their cases/iPads all day long in school). Very frustrating for both of them. Because of this, they frequently just don't even use the case.",3

115277,My boyfriend liked it. I used it as a gift box for valentines day that I thought maybe he could use later. I thought it was OK. not great just OK. I am used to the army surplus store kind of cans. This was not that. BUT VERY nice for a gift can!,3
108367,"These are fairly solidly built, and I don't think anything will snap off under pressure. But the preciseness of build that would make them work really well is a little lacking. For example, adjusting the nut that allows the rod holder to swivel on the mount bracket is difficult, so it's hard to stop the holder from swiveling under pressure. And the bracket's grip on my wooden canoe thwart is not very strong, so I keep a close eye on my rod in the holder when I paddle in case my lone gets snagged as that might pull the holder off the mounting location. I would not trust this to hold an expensive rod while trolling with a motor, but it's been OK for paddling applications. Name-brand rod holders like Scotty have better attention to detail, and it shows in the usability.",3
111064,Glad to have. Haven't had to use,3
106994,The thumb screw would not screw into the unit because there were no threads in the unit. It still fit into the CD slot fine and seems to hold tight. I will thread the hole in holder myself just incase I need to use it later.,3

100444,The piece is beautiful and is great to hit from. We didn't like it because its short enough that you try and look around the device so you don't burn yourself. It's really a great piece.,3
110349,The designs are cute but not all of them work. They don’t transfer properly. I wouldn’t buy this again,3
106849,"I do love the sleek design of this computer with the steel finish along with the red backlit gaming keyboard. It also has a duel fan to keep the laptop cool even when not on best of surfaces. There are a lot of updates and tweaking to the actual system you seem to have to do in order to get it running smoothly and proficiently. I didn't find all of that necessary. It also seems to have glitches which I haven't quite figured out with the screen blacking out for extended times during updates. I also do not care for the fact that it doesn't have an internal CD/DVD RW drive. You would have to have one externally for this particular laptop. It does seem to carry a good amount of memory however which is a plus. It also has just the right amount of ports that you need and is bluetooth enabled so you are good to go there. The graphics on it are pretty decent. However, again with the extensions. The sound really isn't that great on the actual device, but it is great when added device for sound is applied. This isn't my favorite gaming laptop by no means, but it's decent. One would have to make their own judgement.",3
85998,I was expecting this to be a match for NARS Orgasm- it is not. it’s kind of flat in color but definitely a good price,3

But as far as detail goes, if you're not taking the exact route the makers of this map used, don't expect much more than what other maps offer. If you were to travel the same route, then it's a useful tool. But only if...",3

89490,"The manual is quiet descriptive. I like these earpods. First time buying a Bluetooth wireless earpods. Not at all disappointed. Although the headphones doesn't have good bass, it's flat noise. So i installed an equalizer on Android, which gives the sound some quality. So a week later, Left ear stopped working. I am not happy, it sounds nice but the connection between two pods are intermittent. Not a strong connection",3

Giving 3 stars because I did receive a razor just not the one in the picture. Please update picture so that other people don’t have to deal with this disappointment.,3
93577,It's very pretty while it is lit. Unfortunately battery life is very poor. This is particularly a problem because you have to take it apart to change the batteries which is about every two weeks.,3

118736,Update: showed up Monday instead of Thursday. Instead of 2 weeks late it’s only a week or so. Shipping still sucks but not as bad as originally. Original: They’re telling me it is going to take over two weeks to get this part. It also apparently takes two business days to get an email back. No customer service telephone number required. I’d have done better paying double at a stealership. Then I’d have my part so I can take my car on the trip I need it for.,3
81297,"Made me nauseous, even after taking with food. Hesitant to continue usage.",3

99554,It looks very beautiful but the holding ring is very flimsy and really loose.,3
113418,The candle did smell good but you basically have to be right next to it to feel a difference. I bought this for the kitchen to light after cooking and it made no difference. Lasted a long time but the smell is not that strong. Might work better for small spaces.,3
81871,"First, I am really enjoying this natural deodorant as an alternative to the majority with man made aluminum in them. I love the smell and i look forward to using the strawberry one for my daughter when she gets older.

115995,"Maybe not fair to post review yet as I have not used this yet, but I have not used because it didn't come with workable instructions! the ""instructions"" were very brief and very technical, not written for a layperson. I might amend this review if I can figure out how the thing works, and it works well, but meanwhile, it doesn't work at all since I have no idea how to use it. It's lucky I gave 3 stars. Probably should give 1 or 2 for now.",3
91182,"Only had this for a few days, but so far: a) at the highest fan setting this is quieter then every other humidifier I have owned, so other reviews saying it's noisy are perplexing, b) setup/assembly is very easy, thankfully not too many moving parts, c) as noted in other reviews the tanks are very awkward to fill because they won't stand on their own on the one side (fill side up) - with other models you can just stand the tank in a tub on it's own and fill and cap - not with this one, d) filter does not look like it's going to last an entire winter season but that remains to be seen - why did most of the manufacturers move away from the metal filters that had a clay coating on them? I will tell you why - so they can sell more filters!, e) tanks are not clear so you have really no idea when the tank is getting low on water Can't give it five stars because of the awkwardness of filling the tanks and the inability to see if the tanks are low on water before running out - also filter life TBD.",3
109519,This is okay for filling in sparse areas after a pencil but the blonde side almost has a green hue after applying on top of pencil. The wax is nice if you want to use with the powder for a more subtle look,3

89513,I like the product the only problem I have with it is that is so squeaky. Every single time it rolls it makes a horrible squeaking noise. Feel like I need to buy some wd40 to make it stop but that would defeat the purpose and make it smell bad and then get on my skin. Other than that I like it,3
83289,I purchased these and decided to replace my bulbs on May 1st of every year. I’m disappointed that one has already burnt out. It lasted about a month. The bulbs are in separate fixtures over separate tanks. My previous bulbs both lasted at least a year.,3

113483,"Be aware that although this is a GE part, it's not an exact replacement, but is ""compatible"". Because it doesn't use simple spikes, it's not as flexible as far as how you can load dishes as the original one. But, the vinyl coating on the wire is thicker, so it may last longer. Also, save you old wide rollers (or buy new ones), as the rollers with this rack are narrow, and tend to fall between the tracks. So you'll want to replace the narrow rollers with wide ones.",3

Cons: Kind of sloppy construction. One of my legs is not straight but slanted in slightly (it came partially assembled that way). They shorted me one screw so I had to find another one to use. There was only one predrilled hole in he middle, but that wasn’t a big deal. Seems like it could be cheaper for the slap-dash construction.",3

We have had only a couple sunny days since we installed this film, and it did work great then, but for the rest of the time it was awful. On partly cloudy days, the film becomes reflective from the inside. When we turn the lights on inside, we are overwhelmed by the visual chaos because we see all the reflections of everything inside the room superimposed on the shadowy images on the outside.

If I bought another blue/purple shampoo I would probably go with something different but it’s doing it’s job for now.,3

118935,Pros- sturdy enough to remove 2 inch snap rings from loader backhoe Cons- when removing 2 inch +/- external snap rings the handles are too far apart to grasp ad squeeze in one hand. The pliers must be grasped with one handle in each hand and pushed together like long handled pruning cutters used for gardening. This greatly reduces the force which can be applied and is awkward.,3
118945,"Useful when baby was first starting finger foods because I was afraid he was going to choke. It also allowed the baby to eat while I was able to take my eyes off him for a few minutes. But... I really don't use it anymore because I want him to learn to use his fingers, using the pincer grasp. This feeder would hinder finger dexterity. I'll still keep it around for those days when he's teething because I can put a piece of frozen fruit in it for him.",3

101275,"I got this for my bachelorette party because I wanted an overtly sexy white dress but on short notice. I am 5’2, a decently fit 130 lbs, and usually wear a size 2 so I ordered the small. I was very worried about the white being see-through because fitted white clothes typically are. I wanted to be sexy but not vulgar! I put it on and it was tight! It stretches a lot so I was able to fit it comfortably but the more it stretches the more you can see through it. I have a 34C bust and the top fit fine and was not tight. If you get white, I recommend pasties. The midsection and bottom however were pretty constricting. No way I could wear underwear in it and you could see my butt pretty clearly through the dress if I bent over. I feel like the medium would’ve been a better fit and a bigger size would’ve helped with the transparency. A dark color would probably work though. The material itself is pretty decent. It’s very soft and is thick enough to be opaque if it’s not stretched too thin. I ended up getting Spanx shorts to wear underneath and it looked much better! (I’m wearing them under the dress in the photos) I couldn’t have worn the dress otherwise...just too tight and too sheer. Size up and get black!",3

98283,"This mic stand looks good with materials and construction. But it has one big problem - its unbalanced when using a mic like the Blue Bluebird. This causes the stand to wobble and sometimes tip over. The tipping is worse if you don't align the arm perfectly straight with the direction of the base. Sorry, but this is not good and makes it unusable to me. It should work fine with a lighter mic but I wouldn't recommend this if you got a heavier mic to hold.",3

Amazon contacted me once by email asking about my return and I emailed back that I had not heard from the seller. So now I have not heard from the seller nor Amazon.

89285,"I was so thrilled with the Joyo American Sound that I ended up buying the British Sound roughly a week later. While the British Sound is a good deal overall, it just doesn't sound as good as the American Sound does (to me). This has nothing to do with how accurately it emulates a real Marshall amplifier (same thing with the American Sound), as opposed to how usable the sonic flexibility is when going straight into a (guitar) power amp. It's impossible to get a decent balance of bass/middle/treble frequency response, regardless of how clean or distorted the gain is set to. Along with that, there an unpleasant solid state-like harshness when the gain is set higher. While the American Sound isn't foolproof with how you can set it, there's a lot more usable sounds that are pleasing in a guitar amp way. Again, I have to stress that I'm using this pedal to be representative of a guitar amp's preamp, in its totality. If someone is just using this as an OD or distortion pedal, or if only using it as an emergency backup into the PA, it's probably potentially great for that. Also, the British Sound seems to have the potential (depending on where the gain is set) to have a much higher noise floor than the American Sound, too.",3

114724,Can’t believe how flimsy these feel and how much flex they have. They actually took more effort to snap a porcelain tile than my old basic ones. Also there’s not a lot of jaw movement for the amount of handle articulation required. Very poor design. Lots of flex and still lots of hand shock snapping hard porcelain. Jaws are crappy too. I’d recommend these to no one.,3

I have a Bemis Solid wood seat which is ""easy clean"". See the pictures for how I installed it.. And to see how much of a gap it leaves. I tested it out before gluing and the bidet doesn't spray through the gap.. The spay goes... Where it needs to. I got these bumpers because the first Bemis toilet seat I got, broke (pictured). I am quite a heavy gentleman. The angle of the seat caused by the bidet caused it to bend and break. I plan on getting four more of these, I will use two of the new four pack to put between the upper and lower ones., The middle of the seat clearly needs some support too. As to how sticky these things are.. meh, I used a scraper to take off the double stick foam tape. I could tell that foam tape wasn't going to hold. I used two part epoxy instead. I advise placing the bumpers with masking tape first. Take it for a test run. I had to move the bumpers a couple times to get them just right and not wobble. The suggested placement may work well for a round seat, butt it won't answer for an oblong seat. The bumpers clearly need to go horizontal instead of vertical in the case of my bowl and seat. Not all are the same so... use scientific method. I can see how the gap may cause an issue for some, do to spray... it didn't for me, but four isn't enough to get the job done in my case six.... Good luck, I hope this helps. Give it a ""Helpful"" click if it did please. :)",3

189782,"Bought these to replace the MANY resealable sandwich bags my family uses for my kids' snacks. My daughter loves snacking on pretzels and goldfish crackers while we're out and about, but usually can't reseal them effectively - leading to spills on top of a bag that maybe will get 1 more use before it's thrown away. When they initially arrived I did note that they had a rather strong ""plastic"" smell, but after an initial rinse and some time to breathe, they don't have any strong smells anymore. These zippered bags are great for dry snacks, and I love that my kids can easily reclose them. Cleaning so far has been just a light wipe with a soapy sponge and a good rinse before drying. So far so good! I hope they will last a good long while so we can stop burning through baggies.",5

I saw this and decided to give it a try. Easy to set up. Put on the sleep mask, laid down, asked Alexa to set a timer for 10 minutes and play some spa music, closed my eyes and laid my head in the hammock. I could immediately tell it was helping.

Problem is there's a finger smudge on the inside of my lens that only shows up at night. Then I get home plug the camera in to my laptop and no files?

I posted this review since we just received our third and I finally took a closer look at the warranty procedure. It sounds like you are required to return the protector to the company in the HOPE that they will give you a refund/replacement on the protector. I paid more for these than some competitors since they make the warranty claim, but after reading the details of it I have some hesitation on buying another. I would give it 5 stars, but because of my understanding of the warranty I am giving it a 4. UPDATE: a year later and we just had pee soak right through to our mattress. Our 3 year old daughter apparently peed in our bed and laid in it for who knows how long. Upon removing the protector it is wet underneath. Very disappointed.",1

8296,I gave 3 stars instead of 5 because the longest charger broke when I placed the charging piece into my phone and I ordered specifically for the 10' cord but I love the color and I have 2 backups. the shipping was fast and the items were as described.

29947,"The missus ordered three of these on my account. Had I seen their price and read the reviews for myself, I would have immediately canceled the order and questioned her sanity. We had to send one back within 30 days because, just like so many other reviewers here, we saw vertical cracks appearing in the corners. This is apparently a structural issue with these boxes, because one of the two remaining units now has a crack in it as well (see photo). Secondly, the rubber seal in the lid pops out all too easily. That wouldn't be such a big deal in and of itself, but without the seal the lid won't mount properly to the box. I could live with these defects if the boxes were handy in use, but they're in fact so small that there's hardly any space in each compartment. Want to pack the kids a tasty hard-boiled egg? You're out of luck: It's too large and will crack just as rapidly as those corners of your Bento box. And the small metal container THAT COMES WITH THE BOX is high enough that you won't actually be able to close the latter unless the former is placed perfectly in the middle. I don't dole out one-star reviews that often, because I have enough business experience myself to be aware that there are actual people on the receiving end of my criticism, not robots. But $40 is an outrageous price of this flawed product. You'd be better off with a simple one-piece box with a lid and some small containers to keep your salad from spilling over onto your sandwich. You'll probably save some money too.",1

They sent me three replacements--none of them worked for more than an hour--same strobe light effect. The torches look realistic but the solar panels are inferior and so are the electronics.

Those are for a completely different needle and the product pictured in those directions is not the product you will be looking at. The hand needles included, those are tapestry and yarn needles.

Depending on where the break is will determine how easy it is to repair. Also if break isn't clean then you have to drill and shape to get a clean surface to glue.

I looked on line to see if it was still possible to free upgrade to Win 10 Pro, Other users experience ranged from no, maybe, to yes perhaps if you had the product code key for Win 7 Pro. I did not see the product key code as no paperwork came with the computer and I did not see it on the computer. I also felt I should not have to do this. I called Amazon and they agreed to refund my money as they felt it should have come with Win 10 Pro installed and they could not give me an exchange unit.

I read the reviews prior to purchase and was told that the carafe had been improved and would keep the coffee hot; it did not. The first cup was hot as expected but subsequent cups were lukewarm.

Had to remove the battery to shut them down. The ONE of the FOUR that works is great; the software is well designed and has all of the features that I wanted. But the manufacturer clearly has a manufacturing or circuitry design problem. Even the one that works behaves inconsistently. On powerup, sometimes it will begin automatically to record video and sometimes I have to press a button to tell it to begin recording. I would like a setting that would allow me to select that behavior, with the camera obeying the setting reliably, of course. Overall, this product is garbage due to the 75% DOA quality, notwithstanding the good software design (well designed menus).",1

However, after using the first half of the strand, I noticed the second half was snapped in multiple places right along the LED's...it seems like it is about to snap completely at any moment and has a slight flicker... not exactly what people pay for. Overall, I am disappointed and the reason I am giving 2 stars is due to the second half of my strip being damaged on arrival. The lights are really nice and what I expected, however, I am disappointed that I only have 1/2 of a 32ft strand working 100%.",2

One side of the holster would not connect to the belt. I had to maneuver the metal with pliers in order to connect the pieces. Unfortunately, this resulted in some of the metal coating on the belt to flake off. Once I fixed the holster and put the two pieces together, the belt looked great.

Replaced this with the K&H car seat and that is so much better in comparison. pros- good size, and the fleece is comfy and my dog was cozy. Cons- the sides have opening and that is such a major design flaw. So that meant that it isnt as secure as i wanted it to be. the belt that attaches the dog to the seat doesnt even really attach to the seat but to the seatbelt (which again is easy to come off as the sides have an opening) so whats the point really, just serves as a cozy dog bed and not really a car seat in my opinion.",2

My initial thought when receiving the new pair was ""well...these LOOK similar to my old ones."" They felt a bit cheaper. Not as quality construction. Yet, they may be better, so I gave them a chance. I wear these boots 5 days a week as a security officer. Nothing overly strenuous, an inside job for the most part. After wearing the boots for a couple months, I noticed a crack starting on my left boot, in the crease where my toes bend back. I added boot polish, thinking maybe it was dried out or some issue was there. The crack has gotten worse and I am now seeing the same problem starting on the other boot.

But now I still have to go buy an orange folder. I wouldn’t take the chance again and order these in the future.,2
53489,Worked great at first but after a few days the camera HAD to be plugged into the charger for it to work. It wouldn’t last no more than 5 minutes without the charger being plugged. Also the menu was a bit confusing and some things just didn’t make sense.,2

77724,"Original post: I already want a refund I won't be able to get... Corners don't even match up. Can't assemble it. Update: downgraded from a two star to one star. Very unclear directions (no, not missed details, just plain unclear, not enough info to assemble) led me to where I may not complete assembly. Possibly misleading dimensions for plywood. Basically this sucks so bad and I hate it.. Here is what I wrote before the stop work errors (and I build lengthy projects every day).... Saying its a pain in the butt to put this thing together is an understatement. Be ready for stressful directions every step of the way. It never ends. Really. Even the adhesive pad is a pain to peel. If you're ready to be James bond, buy this. The pain of assembly can not be underestimated. Worst experience. Sucks 100% 2nd Update: I upgraded from one to two stars because it will eventually go together after several days off work and has lasted did months. Besides that assembly sucks more than you can imagine.....",2
67863,Works great. I bought this less than a year ago. The sprayer is now dripping after 11 months. I emailed the vendor about replacement head and I have yet to hear from them. It has been a week since my inquiry about replacing the sprayer head.,2

72831,worked great for a couple days had it installed by a local shop then it died so i returned it,2
49815,"The fence arrived damaged though the shipping box was fine. Clearly whoever boxed and shipped this product could give a crap that they were sending an obviously defective product. What a waste of my time, now I have to box and return this to get my money back and buy another fence. Clearly not from here again. I gave 2 stars because I think the fence itself (undamaged) would have worked just fine.",2
58758,I just received my product and I’m disappointed to say it is ripped from the bottom right corner which makes it easier for the keyboard cover to lift up when I type.,2
50710,I really don't like the feel of these.. You can't tell from the picture but they're more rubber-y than fabric like you want your hair ties to be. I don't want these in my hair!,2
66536,They are OK. I’m not really for me. They taste fake. I will not be repurchasing.,2

76925,"My biggest issue with this wristband was that my heart rate was not accurate. I compared it to an Apple watch and a gym heart rate monitor, both read heart rates much higher than the wristband. The frequency of readings is also low. For a HIIT workout, the calories burned was also underestimated compared to the Apple watch or gym heart rate monitor. I do not recommend this item.",2
51981,What a piece of junk did not even last a month before the teeth started breaking off what a waste of money,2
74797,So I only watched this bc Tiffany was in it. Her comedy is a bit crass for me but you would have to be heartless not to love the girl (and her book is awesome). But this movie.....it underestimates what real comedy this girl is capable of.,2
41946,The clasp on the band is way too bulky and clashes. Otherwise it is solidly built and looks alright but huge stitches and looks pretty cheap.,2

But if you sleep with someone else, you roll together, and with it being memory foam even if you move away the indent is still there and you just slide back together. It also gets really hot.

60801,"Not clear to me what this product is supposed to do. I thought it was hair setting lotion. Something to spray on my hair before I use the hot roller brush to help set and maintain my hair's curl and body. Turns out, that can't be what it is for because it made my hair so heavy and so sticky that I had to wash it out immediately before I could leave the house. It made my hair look dirty and just awful. They should re purpose the item. Make it perhaps a treatment product that you put on, let your hair sit in it for a while and then wash it out. There's no way this should be actually left in your hair.",2

I will not buy from Novelty Place again. On a positive note, we received them quickly.",2

I never imagined this would be common but it was on both of the boots I ordered. They came in a shoe bag, not box, and they were very squashed. Also I ordered kids size 1 and they were huge.

40950,I absolutely loved the design of this shirt. Ordered a 2x which is what I always wear. 6 ft tall 300 lbs. couldn’t get the 2x short over my head. Neck was so tight it cut off circulation. Didn’t even make it down to my belly button. Gave shirt to my wife who is 5ft 1 and 100 lbs. Fit her fine. So men’s 2x fits like a women’s medium. Loved the silk like material and design though. Just wished it was a true 2x.,2
49999,"The medium size was too big. If normally you wear size M, this shirt fits like L. It is not true to size.",2
77047,The flavor didn’t disperse throughout. There were also rinds that didn’t pop and were very hard. Would not purchase again.,2

So I bought this nipple shield as my last attempt at a shield to help with my attempts to get back to exclusively breastfeeding my four-week-old. Unfortunately, there was absolutely no way for this thing to work. With Medela, you flip it back and put it on to create a suction. This does NOT do that. The silicone it is made out of is very thick, very thick and dense though you can pull back the butterfly wings there is absolutely no way for it to stay on as there is no suction. My nipples could not fit even when I was able to stretch out the opening by pulling the wings. I'm assuming if you're nipples are small enough you can just put them inside and hold it on using your fingers but if you have large nipples this is impossible. So this was an absolute waste of time and hope but nice concept if you have small nipples.",2
73031,"Bought this on behalf of my mom, who wanted to give it as a gift to my dad. She thought it was going to be a chrome finish, but it is cheap-looking matte silver plastic. Like a silver barbie shoe from the 90s. I can't tell you if it works, because she refused to give it to him...it looked that cheap. She felt misled by the photos on here, so 2 stars.

That is the only use I got out of it. I went to use it a second time today, and upon closing the lid the latch snapped off one side.

156254,"Not bad for a low-carb bread. It toasts fairly well and is great with some cream cheese and everything bagel seasoning. I tried it with just butter and it was like cardboard...it needs to be a vehicle for something or else it is flavorless. I prefer the bagels from this brand, but they are $7+ for shipping and the bread is free/prime. Definitely worth a try if you are following a low-carb/keto diet.",4
155482,Easy to install! Comes with a template to install. Glass is a little shiny but it saved my phone when I dropped it on concrete. The screen protector cracked but my phone was safe.,4
130873,Same as for the book 2 and planner.,4
131869,When I first attempt to put the screen protector on it had a ton of bubbles and it looked horrible. I tried a few more times but couldn’t get it perfect. I almost bought another one. After about 2 day all the bubbles smother out by themselves and now it’s perfect. I haven’t dropped my phone yet but this screen is very thick so I have no doubt that it will protect my phone.,4
127851,This is a cute little thing. I got it for my 3 year old son and it’s more for 18 months to 2 year olds. He still loves it and the battery lasts a good amount of time. It’s best for indoor use.,4

153430,"I could see this story coming from the first time that Nick and Ruby met in the prior volume of the series! I'm so happy that they got their own book! I was pretty ticked off at how Ruby's friends and family all pretty much just abandon her once their meet their mates. Especially her sister! They were struggling to make ends meet when the two of them were sharing an apartment; why in the world would Trixie think that Ruby was doing okay on her own? I was also quite unhappy with how badly everyone treated Nick. Even after he fell in love with Ruby and tried to turn his life around being a good guy in every way he knew how. That they had to flee the city in the end was especially not cool. The intrigue of this tale is quite wrapped up in some of the other stories and players in the series, and it appears that there will probably be more entanglement there. Things are certainly getting interesting in this series!",4
142497,"Looks like a good product, havent installed them yet because they just came in today. Just wanted to point out to those that might not know, the ""how to"" video attached to this product is not relevant at all. Nor does it even have the product in the video.

159965,Fit a little to the loose side for me but feels super nice,4
142896,The box is came in was very damaged. There were dents in the container itself as well. But it seems like a good quality night cream. Thick but doesn’t feel greasy at all. Nice smell.,4
120500,Worked well and met my beeds for a replacement bell,4
139654,They are cool looking but don't last long. Good thing they are cheap. The magnets fall out pretty easily if dropped. One plus (besides looking cool) is that the magnets are pretty powerful for being so small. Held items on fridge very well.,4
143307,I am pleased. My old charger unit was lost and this works perfectly with my Sonicare toothbrush. It does take a while for the toothbrush to be fully charged and the unit is pricey. It's also Philips OEM so there's an assurance of quality. If all you're concerned about is a charger there are chargers much cheaper than this. If you like having your brush sanitized this is your best bet.,4

159659,Seems to be good quality and easy to roll up when not in use.,4
140329,it is a really nice piece and the main choker seems very well made but the chain on the end is held on with links that are way too soft and bend open causing the choker not to be tight around the neck (my GF has a very small neck) I have had to fix it 3 times and it may need to be Soldered . If you aren't handy this could be frustrating.,4

120793,Haven't used it yet. Grades based on only practicing with it a little.,4
142957,I love this tea pot. The only bad thing is you need to watch it because it will boil over easily and get all over your stove.. this being said I love it and would definitely have bought it again. :-),4

133464,"Fits well in my iPhone, also looks good",4
135421,I gave this as a birthday gift to my friends one year old and she loved it. The price was beyond reasonable. It does have to be completely assembled. I didn’t know that before the party so I was in the hallway assembling it with moments to spare. It lights up and makes sounds. The baby loved it and took to it immediately. So she’s the one who actually rated the product for me. Great gift for a 1st birthday! Very durable and sturdy. She was able to grasp the handle and it didn’t take off with her like I expected the wheels clicked giving her time to take her steps.,4

157960,"Like others who have reviewed this item, all that came in the box was the tip top temp, no dial setting chart. Haven't used it yet but assume it will work just as well as my buddy's. Disappointed I had to go to their web site to copy the chart. Seems somewhat unprofessional.",4
142330,Very good quality and color is true to photo. Bought these for my hubby's truck and he had the front ones on immediately but still has not installed the backseat saying it is very difficult to install.,4
142553,I’d give it 5 stars if it didn’t fall out of my daughter’s ear and she lost it. :( They’re adorable and so pretty.,4
158269,"I though ""oh here is that guy from taken at it again."" But was a good balance and mix of action, posing questions, and twists all along the way. Well worth a watch",4
145468,"Excellent support!. Work well holding up my phone while driving. Thumb up. Just don't take it out offen, then it will be a hassle.",4
123520,Good read. Like Caleb's four friends lots of future stories there. Caleb and Kira both had a lot of things to overcome but this story answered a lot of them.,4
126045,They are nice but break after awhile.,4

121099,"The pens work nicely enough, but unlike most pens, the pen caps won't stay on the back of the pen. As I suspect many people do, I tried to place the pen cap on the back of the pen so as not to lose it when writing, and it doesn't fit snugly and just kind of wobbles around there.",4
136882,I used this product for my new counter top and I like it.,4
157257,Nice addition. I may change my mind one way or the other when we finally play.,4
151486,I wish I had paid more attention to the size. They are much bigger than letter size. They are really too big for what I want. I will pay more attention next time and be SURE that they are letter size. The envelops are nice.,4
131483,The part looks good. I have not installed it yet. It is listed as a DB Electrical unit. The box is labeled J&N Alternators. Are they manufactured in the same bldg.? Why doesn't the heading say J&N Alternator?,4

140893,My wife got this. It does work good. Ease of use was was very simple. I am still playing around with it. I guess i am unclear on how to use it when you don't touch the skin. But other then that. Seems reliable and has not let me down yet.,4

145594,"I usually use rapid lash. However, this is a decent substitute.",4
129737,I like that these are bright enough to see and not so bright they blind everyone,4
128637,I really like the color and the compartment on bottom. Great place for easy access keys. It is mainly comfortable. I wear cause I like the size and the security of having my purse hard for anyone to take or get into. I would definitely buy again.,4
157329,"This is a non-water soluble paste. I've tried many and none kept my very poor fitting dentures in. THIS stuff not only keeps poor fitting dentures in but keeps them in for 24 hrs and I can EAT most foods! I don't recommend having poor fitting dentures but after many tries I give up getting good ones. What I found with this brand is to put it on sparingly but put it on the whole area that fits your mouth. I use a tiny spatula, well it really is the flat side of a plastic orange peeler :) It has to be on dry dentures, I just blot mine off if there is any moisture still on them. I also use a paper towel and dry off my gums where the dentures touch. I hold them in tight and don't eat or drink for half an hour. Good to go. If for what ever reason I had too much and feel leakage in the back I just use a tissue and wipe it off. I also found that if I leave them in overnight (24 hrs) its much easier to clean off the dentures and my mouth. If I take them out at night, before bed, it is really still very sticky and very hard to get it off the dentures and especially my gums. Life saver, really!",4
158250,the batteries were worn and with some rust. however the doll is very pretty,4
124502,Cute but cane dirty and that’s gross,4
142833,There was a lot of human emotion in the story. I thought it ended a bit too abruptly and did not follow up on the second couple as to what happened to them. Did they marry? Maybe the author intended to continue their story in another book,4

124733,"I thought this worked quite well and it certainly sped things up. The shaft has a hex shape so it doesn’t slip in the drill. We have pretty heavy soil and I didn’t have any trouble but you also have to hold the drill firmly like you would for any job or, yes, it is likely to give your wrist a jerk.",4
120316,"I like this item, easy to set up and use. The only thing I don't like is trying to get it back in the bag. ugh I bought a golf mat too so I could use it in my hall. Would be nice if a mat was included.",4
145707,"To be clear, it's not a safety harness at all. It will not protect your child like a car's seatbelt. But it will restrain your child and keep him/her seated during the flight. I used it on my 16 month old. It was quick to install but hard to tighten the straps. Also, it comes in a little bag for storage. Bottom line: Nothing extraordinary, but it kept my toddler from climbing over seats thereby making toddler travel a bit more manageable.",4
145453,"A little difficult to put together, the side triangle pieces don't fit exactly. Functions great though, and doesn't take up a ton of space. We also like the extra storage it provides! Company was easy to work with when we had a defective part. We sent in a request for a new part and it came in, in less than a week. We were relieved to not have to pack the whole thing back up to return it.",4
137529,"The mats look classy and are very durable, however they do not grip the carpet as well as they could, as they slide overtime.",4
134435,Bulbs are awesome so far. They were super easy to install. Just plug and go. The packaging was great and they came right on time as promised.,4
153488,Initially Flashlight completely stopped working after 2 weeks. Cree saw my original review and send me a new flashlight. I just charged the flashlight and the flashlight seems to be working. Haven’t used it yet but I’m excited to.,4
129042,Handle broke pretty fast but it was my fault cause I overfilled it with clothes.,4
159647,"So far this product has worked. I have the Ring camera right outside my front door, and I get a lot of foot traffic in my area. This seems to work pretty well.",4
143585,use these for my snails and they seem to like it every here and there. my fish sometimes also gets a nibble in every here and there.,4
135218,The product seemed like it was going to be awesome if I could've got it to work. No matter what batteries I installed I couldn't get it to work. I sadly had to return the product.,4
156229,Good organizer for outgoing mail.,4
146775,They are good quality leggings but don’t come with a fleece lining as described by the vendor. I bought them for my daughter thinking they’d be good for protecting her in the cold weather but they’re 95% cotton with no warm lining inside. I’ll still keep them as my daughter likes the colors and designs. They’re very reasonably priced.,4
138340,There were a few issues on the front but the company corrected the issues and sent out a new one right away. Handled it like champs!,4
124470,"I've used this twice, with no visible difference so far. First time was after a shower but I didn't exfoliate my feet in the shower. Second time, today, I did exfoliate and used this right out of the shower so I'm hoping to see a significant softness to my feet. I will edit this in coming days with more information as it becomes visible and available. My rating will change after that point.",4
137841,"I bought this because a broken shoulder limits my ability to reach behind. The so called appendix carry method may work for some, but if you need to lose a few pounds like I do, sitting down will cause the weapon to tilt outward at a more visible angle. I'm sure that once I get my range of motion back and can move the holster more towards the small of my back it will be fine. Overall this is a well made holster that provides good safety features for the Ruger LCP II which is a weapon that is essentially carried cocked and ready to fire.",4
127425,looks like a good socket set haven't used yet but no complaints,4
149776,"Solid and does the job but the heads of the bolts, as well as the other welded bits to attach the push up handles, stick out enough from the bottom that you can scratch your floors with it. (My solution was to put felt floor protectors over all the nubs) The foam for the handles smell and make your hands smell, they could probably be replaced, I put socks over mine.",4
142244,Fit was pretty good. Not 100% but a good 98% fit. No trimming needed but there was a little Gap on the 4x4 shifter. This is the only full mat I could find. I've only had a couple weeks so I can not comment on the durability yet.,4
130634,I actually thought it would feel softer. Then I realized it had wires in it so it would stand and could bend at the neck. I purchased this giraffe to attach a ticket to the zoo for my grandson. It will work well for that purpose. I love its expression and I know he will enjoy adding it to his collection of plush animals.,4
126026,"I am a nanny who focuses on education. I bought this for our little circle time, I do like the product. It hasn’t held up super well though with a pretty handsy two year old. I wish the days of the week were a little bigger but great for kids starting to learn about calendars!",4
139698,"Bought a pair at Walmart. Same exact pair. Same exact price. These are better quality, but much tighter, as if made for a big headed child. Great sound, but occasionally cut out which is why I was replacing my old pair.",4
153257,Bought this for the car because of fingerprints. This reduces but does not eliminate them which is good enough for me. The first one was broken so they sent a new one pretty pick. Stuck it on and the fit it decent.,4
133813,Front piece is more ridged than I would like but the ponytail slit is nice. Already got two compliments.,4
130744,"I had a pair like this for a year that were very comfortable, needed no working in. Unfortunately my puppy chewed them. So I got these to replace them. A bit tight in toe area. But otherwise fine.",4
157941,"Simple to assemble even though I didn't quite understand the instructions or I was missing a piece, but my 55"" tv sits nicely on it. It's really compact which is nice because the tv sits close to the wall so it looks good",4
156385,"Item arrived in great condition, size is great. I had a difficult time getting the bottom draw open. So now scared to close all the way. The top piece I am not crazy about, items on back row get hidden by front row. Would like to find another piece to insert. Overall a good purchase and have been able to organize and unclutter my bathroom with face products",4
157372,Nice color! I also bought one for my friend who loved it!,4
143527,"Didn’t last as long as I had hoped. But worth the price I paid, for sure.",4
132157,Worked as intended. Plenty of space to tuck away extra wire.,4
121002,Awesome product! It’s cute and very functional my only complaint is I wish the hook on top was larger because it doesn’t fit on my rods. This picture is my bathroom shower rod granted it’s a sturdy rod. It’s the closest one that fits,4
121577,So far look good I haven’t wore them yet but think they are going work,4
158583,Very bright omg...but does'nt hold charge long enough in my opinion.,4
137332,The battery life is very short always need to take down and recharge. Also they fall frequently from cabinet.,4
149434,Very pretty and high quality. Only thing I don't like is that in certain lightings it just looks like it has a bunch of small holes for decoration instead of the flower pattern.,4
121392,"Worked great for 3.5 years. Then one of the heating bars, made of glass, fractured. Kind of a dramatic way to retire a toaster. Because it was one of the top bars, I almost didn’t even notice it. Pretty dangerous if you ask me. Before that, it worked great. Perfect for toasting and baking. Only downside was the dials need to be turned up all the way and then set to the desired time. Otherwise the timer might not turn off, which of course is a fire hazard. Now that I have to seek out a new one, I may or may not try this brand/model again. Still undecided.",4
139277,"I have finished a complete bottle Pink Stork Pro: Pregnancy Probiotic and I am currently starting my second bottle. At the beginning of my second trimester (first pregnancy) I began experiencing severe heartburn. After consulting my doctor, I began taking Zantac 150 and Tums. Some days my heartburn and acid reflux would still be unbearable after taking the max dosages of Zantac 150 and Tums. I had to curb my diet away from any triggering foods, but even drinking water would give me acid reflux. I researched to find if there was any supplement to help w/ the stomach acid and came across Pink Stork Pro: Pregnancy Probiotic. I have already been taking Pink Stork Premium Prenatal Vitamin as well as some of their other supplements and I have had good experience. After a month of changing my diet, sleeping/napping upright, and taking Pink Stork Pro: Pregnancy Probiotic, the extreme heartburn began to lessen, there were a few days that I could survive w/ just take 1 Zantac 150 pill a day. One evening I gave into my cravings for spicy Mexican food and I took a Zantac 150 and probiotic. Somehow I got away w/ the meal without acid reflux. This isn't a major cure for heartburn but it has helped regulate my stomach acid, but you need to alter your diet as well.",4
151403,Smaller than I expected but still pretty good,4
125943,Liking this product so far,4
128030,"Well shipping was very fast and came on a appropriate package. Only sad thing is that they run a little big, keep this in mind if you decide to get one but as for the quality it’s great and I love the style. 4/5",4
121475,Very nice fit the money.,4
139275,"When I initially ordered this skirt I had low expectations but when I received it I found myself more surprised on how much I liked it. It's soft, flowy, looks fairly elegant, and it's not see through. It has a double layer on the top part of the skirt if you're concerned about it being see-through but I haven't had any issues. I am 5'9, 150 pounds and I ordered a large. Really it doesn't matter what size you order as it wraps around and you tie the strings together however you like it. My only issue with it is that I wish it could be a little longer as the longest part just reaches my ankles. The skirt is a lot lighter of a tan than I was expecting as well so be careful about what you pair it with, and if you're like me it drains me of my color",4
144145,I bought these according to others reviews. I went 2 sizes higher and could have only went 1 size.,4
159449,"It had a dent when I received it, but other than that it’s a good cooler for the price.",4
120412,These help me with toe alignment blisters,4
157463,Beautiful keepsake for my Mom's cat. She will love it. Sad a little scoop and funnel didn't come with it to help with filling like others I have purchased but a beautiful piece!,4
132915,"Great cups, worked perfectly for our smokey mountain honey moon! :)",4
128190,"I enjoyed this book. Plot was good, had some twists, overall quite enjoyable.",4
156669,Everything is good except the spark plug. Was sent a wrong size. I have to buy spark plug outside,4
125056,"First of all, the quality and fabric is great. Very comfortable, stays on my head, and does a great job of shielding my face much better than a baseball cap does. The downside? There’s no way to not look nerdy in this thing. It is not attractive. It is not stylish. I really only wear it when I’m working in my yard alone. Tried to wear it out on the boat with family, but got made fun of.... so I’ll stick to other styles when out in public.",4
154688,"My 8 week old puppy broke one of the poles inside the same day, he isn't use to it yet and so just scratching at it he eventually rattled one of the pins from pole.",4
143681,Do not use the supplied two way tape to install this it buffers the vibration too much I used just a dab of silicone caulk and now it works perfectly.,4
149244,Love that it’s easy to use and install and that it’s actually working the way I hoped it would,4
144784,"Ordered these gray memory rugs for our remodeled bathroom. They are ok. They are more of a light bluish gray than a gray. So far they seem durable having had couple weeks. They are comfortable to walk on. Good overall, wish color was more gray as advertised.",4
148234,"This book is quite simple to understand. Among all the stock's investment, high dividend stock's investment is probably the only easy and low risk way to get returns. Timing makes all the difference.",4
124113,They are a little snug,4
152861,I really like this brace but which it had something at the top to keep it from rolling,4
127892,It works and quickly! The menthol is a very powerful odor and it made my eyes water. I applied this cream with another aspirin based cream and that reduced the menthol aroma.,4
153989,"For some reason, my thumb sticks on my PS4 controller was worn down. These fixed that problem and will probably outlast the life the controller!!",4
151867,The app is working fine till now. The videos are good,4
153702,"I am slowly beginning to switch over the little things in my house for more natural products, and this was one of the things I purchased on Amazon to do just that. It smells really wonderful, and since it's not made from chemicals I don't think the scent would irritate most people. However, this product didn't quite eliminate the odors from my shoes as much as I would've liked. I put my shoes through the wringer so they've got some pretty tough smells to get rid of, but I was hoping this spray would really get the job done. I would say it eliminated about 80% of the odor, so this would probably work well for anyone who doesn't have some really strong scents to try to get rid of.",4
159926,"The price was right, however this hose is stiffer than I expected. When it is cold, it really doesn't uncoil as others that I have had. I had to let it hang over a 10' ladder for a week to get all of the coils out. Probably won't buy this again. The upside is that it does look and feel heavy duty, so it will probably last a long time before the inevitable rub through from the pressure washer vibrations.",4
121205,Easy to put up and works as advertised,4
136591,"We are really liking this vacuum so far. Our Hoover broke at the handle (15 year old unit) so it was time to replace it. I almost bought another Hoover but I liked the Lift Away feature of this one. The assembly instructions could use some fine tuning, especially for assembling the pieces that hold the accessories. In fact, the accessories holder seems like something they forgot and added on later. For those reasons, I give it four starts instead of five but other than that, the vacuum works great. The electrical cord is a little shorter than the old Hoover we had but long enough for us. As others have said, the suction of this unit is really good.",4
135661,Decent carpet. Think it could be little thicker but it is good. Boat slides off and on a lot better. Don't know where it was thinner than previous carpet or just all the dirt. I would buy again. Hopefully it holds up.,4
136691,FIts really good super cute top minus the kinda cheap fabric but otherwise still cute and fits good.,4
120859,It was missing the shoulder strap.,4
149838,The quality and outcome of the meal when prepared with a ceramic smoker and grill is unique. many dont know of this uniqueness but this book allows you to enjoy the great taste of each recipes . The recipes in the book can be applied by a first time user and there will be no regret.,4
133576,"This was the right pipe for my truck, it fit fine except the new up pipe I got forced me to pound a flat spot in this one to allow it to fit properly. I haven't had any issues with it after a year.",4
130282,Beautiful and classy,4
150214,This screen protector works as advertised. It looks durable and well made to protect my device screen. Very easy to install,4
123717,This product came folded because of delivery.,4
156523,It counts accurately great option with or without sound easy to use,4
157842,"Very soft and comfortable. I like that it has a big band, which helps a lot with the back pain. The material is breathable and stretchy, so I don’t feel like I’m being suffocated or anything. The padding do fall out of the pockets when I put it in the washer; but that’s not a big issue for me as I don’t use the padding anyways. The size fit as expected. I’m normally 32DD probably DDD now that I have milk and a medium fits me well.",4
143408,Good sound ..stays in ears .. Charges fast,4
124722,Was looking for a truly plush Santa hat. This one was exactly it. Made with quality materials. Thick fabric and soft fuzzy white trim. Highly recommend!,4
126132,"I left a bad review earlier because I thought the cable was broken. Turns out it's balanced, not unbalanced and it works in the signal chain it actually belongs in. Sorry for the misunderstanding, here's a better review since the cable technically does work.",4
127462,"It's ok doesn't mix well, clumpy",4
122951,I had hoped to achieve a lighter color but I have grown to like the color and am satisfied with the finished product.,4
126052,"There seem to be some quality control issues with the WiFi controller, but the seller was very quick to resolve the problem and send a replacement.",4
123953,"Love the liquid chalk, but wish some of the markers were not so big and had a problem with one of the markers leaking a bit when I shook it. So...when you shake the markers, make sure you leave the lid on. Other than that, the markers work good.",4
149688,Still got bubbles after following all the directions.,4
158118,Worked just as advertised! Smells like every other Aveda product.,4
154474,Works fine. We also have a flip phone from At&t but it doesn't fit.,4
158048,Worked as it should .my seats needed a few coats .did not clog but hand got sore from spray nozzle,4
139747,Like all about it except... You need to remove the entire assembly (unwrap the wire) from bike to recharge - not convenient,4
135051,Slow to heat.. more wattage in the heater element would help. Don't expect an instant brown marshmallow.,4
139491,"Good color and style. The length is a little short (below the calf). If you are not bothered by socks that slide down routinely, these socks are a good deal. The quality of the fabric is a bit better than others that I have purchased in the past.",4
120108,Nice big banner but the Pom poms were a pain to puff up and put together.,4
128020,Got this for my daughter to use when we travel etc. Seems to hold up pretty good. The only thing I see that I don’t care for is the screen. I think it could be better quality.,4
145387,"Light weight and looks great! The battery life could use some improvement but as the battery stabilized after several uses, the battery life seemed to have improved but I'm still only about a week into using it. The touch screen is a bit slow to react to the touch but does not hinder the functionality of the watch. I'm enjoying the watch, it's serving its purpose.",4
138365,"The colors are vibrant and the size is perfect for the wall I have it on. The reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the black marks all across the bottom of the edges of the canvases. I used a magic eraser to remove the marks. Thankfully, that worked. Otherwise, I am happy with the birds.",4
137054,Good construction and helps with packing and organization. If you're looking for a couple good bags this is it.,4
124318,Stones fell out it's an inconvenience please work on adhesive.,4
139132,"I am very pleased with this purchase. The colors are slightly more muted than the product pic, but still lovely. I typically wear a US 6, and the M is a perfect fit. The dress is flowy and has a thin lining, so it's light without being see through. I'm 5 ft 4 in and it comes to my ankles like the model. Definitely would buy another print.",4
131004,I wouldn’t go as far as to say this helps with weight loss or metabolism but it definitely helps with stress. I did find that my stress level felt reduced and I handled things in a more calm way lol,4
139039,Perfect for my 10/22. Especially for the price. Pretty clear scope. Dont know how durable it is but hey....,4
159213,"The only thing bad was the paint was not perfect, half of one didn’t get painted",4
150552,"I wear a size 12 jean and have a big backside, I ordered the large and it was a little snug. If there was a size between large and extra large then it would fit perfectly. THAT BEING SAID, despite the fact that they were tight and STILL didn't squish my butt at all speaks volumes on these shorts butt lifting powers! They are also good for the girl whose booty always seems to turn any pair of shorts into booty shorts, they are long enough to hide the cheeks. I will definitely be ordering more in different colors and sizes for when I progress more in my fitness journey. I highly recommend these. They're also mad cute and structured",4
124262,Love this product! Use it every day. Very universal and can be used for multiple purposes and ways.,4
154534,It’s a little softer then I had hoped but it’s very good quality. Seems well made and great value for 2 pillows. Would definitely recommend it to others. I got them in king size.,4
137473,These sleeves offered great support. I'm able to run around the house with these on without having to wear orthotics. The only issue I have is due to my high instep. The fabric wads up on top of my foot which gets uncomfortable.,4
149625,The bulbs were used as a replacement in a bathroom vanity fixture. The only criticism is the former bulb cast a whiter less yellow light.,4
134557,My grandson was happy to receive this backpack. He will be using it for school.,4
148308,"Like the protection. Didn't like the screen protector. Broke when I was putting it on, I should've put it on before I put on the case. Case is a bit hard to put on but worth the protection!",4
152463,Purchased as a gift for an animal lover child.,4
129125,So far the product works well. Haven’t used it for very long but I will update if any problems or great things happen. Appears to be a decent product for the price point.,4
125295,"I purchased these cards after my grandfather passed away to say thanks to all the people who visited and sent kind words to me. The cards were really nice. What you see in the product description is really what you get. The only down side was that I got a couple cards that looked like they’d gotten a bit of makeup on them. Other than the few cards that were unusable because of the stains, the cards served their purpose well.",4
136131,Works very well. Good quality.,4
138886,"Super cute! Fan is very strong. I like that they each have an Android and iPhone plug on them with a cap to cover the plug. Just confused as to why some worked on my mom's Android and some didn't, whereas they all worked on my Android.",4

134534,"The quality of the material is great. I ordered specifically to embroider for a client’s annual cookie baking party. The apron was a true red though the chef hats tended toward orange which was disappointing. The apron embroidered nicely and overall, my client is satisfied. If you order this product, plan in advance. Delivery time is about 2-3 weeks.",4
130693,These scents last a long time! It was very nice to have sample size spray. Awesome to get four scents to try before committing to one.,4
146819,The buckle is kind of heavy,4
121418,Installed this set on my atv. Product comes in nice and neat packaging. The whole setup is plug and play with a relativly easy install as long as your patient with hiding the wires. App works great and the lights will come on the same color you turned them off. Led housing is stout material that i will enjoy torture testing in the mud! Only 4 stars because the wires are way to long for atv's and would be very difficult to cut and shorten. Had to ziptie lots of extra wire up out of the way.,4
137468,"I do enjoy this wristband. It allows my wost to breathe easy, and I don't have to worry about peeling (sensitive skin). It complements the watch well, and it's quite sporty. I'm planning on getting the other colors also.",4
158274,"This is a very pretty classy dress. For those looking I suggest if you have large breast please size up. I normally wear a size 12 in most clothing. Often I can wear a 10. Just depends on line of clothing. I’m 5’6” tall, 36 DD, curvy figure. 162 lbs. the length is as shown. Hits middle knee. Very classy dress. Unfortunately im going to have to exchange for a 14! I’ve never had to order that size in any clothing. So this dress runs a tad small.",4
152728,This cap was way too small for our 7 yr old. It actually hurt her ears & pulled. I give it 4 stars because the company was quick to respond & resolve! I have purchased 2 adult sizes that both my daughter & I can use & they work great!! This cap would be perfect for a smaller child.,4
146458,Liked the dustpan. Broom should have been little longer but still it is good,4
122371,Smell is not that strong at all I have 4 plugged in thru out the home and I can barely tell it,4
132649,The hinges are great but handles are on the soft side but for the price it's ok . They look very good and changed door appearance . If handles ever brake you can replace them still good for the price and I like the pre drill holes .,4
132301,"I love this scarf and the material; however, the description states the scarf is 78 x 24 and it's actually 56 x 49. Kind of disappointed because I wanted a longer scarf.",4
127637,"I got this, installation was super easy with that green tray. First one had a little problem though, huge lost of sensitivity in the middle, it's like a huge bubble in the middle. However I send them email, and they said send them a video of the problem, and they replaced it. The 2nd one I got from them works like a charm. Good customer service.",4

Within a few hours, I was sent an apology for the inconvenience and promised a refund.*** I ordered my daughter two of these in a small as she wears a small in her gymnastics leotards and another brand dance leotard. I did not check the return policy because I’ve always been able to return absolutely anything I’ve ever bought off amazon with no issue. Guess it’s my own fault, but it stinks now that I’m stuck with two leotards that are too small.",4

158506,"For me I bought these to help with plywood size type rip cuts. Once you get the clamp square to use it as a guide it works well. But thats the issue I had. It seemed to me that when you ""set the clamp"" this thing has a tendency to move..you need to keep checking with a ruler/square to make sure the thing is totally straight. The issue I see are the clamps themselves. I don't know how they could be done better, but maybe don't make out of plastic? They are not that smooth either. Each clamp has markings like a ruler, but I found that because of the clamps on the bottom, its pretty much impossible to use them for marking etc as they clamps do not lay flat especially on a long piece. They also don't clamp well on thinner material like 1/4 or 1/8 plywood. I do use them but find myself wondering...can't they make a clamp that when you clamp it the clamps automatically square it up? Oh well. I like them but wanted to love them.",4
146446,It’s not the softest and shrunk when washed but it fit good enough and is light weight and perfect for the summer nights!,4

129183,It looks great but it's not as grippy as my clear TPU case; it's a little bit too smooth. So I'll be using this more for particular occasions rather than everyday.,4
159775,The main story about Chloe and Derek was believable even for insta love and blended well with the Archer family back story. A wonderful novella written so well I felt like I had just read a full length novel with a nice flow and engaging story line.,4
145466,This charger does what it intends to do but the charge definitely doesn't last as long as the original. Good as a backup charger.,4
130407,"Charge is slow, but if your not in a hurry it works great.",4
150207,"Somewhat complicated to use, but materials are good.",4
148143,"LOVE the look and quality. Only reason I didn't give 5 *'s is because it is a bit messy sliding the tray out to clean. My youngest has a challenging time when it's his week to clean the cage. Overall, great product!",4
134965,It's not the same quality as brother but it works fine. Very thin tape and slightly harder to peal apart from the back. The price is worth it though I needed it to label several note books and folders so for my purpose it was ok.,4
138973,"Good product . I would suggest loctite so it doesn't come apart. Also I work construction and some ""puck style "" locks and gang box lock are not accessible due to the width of the organizer( I used all the extensions about 2"" wide). But other than that it's a great concept and product",4
132514,"This sofa sleeper is small and short, but very comfortable.",4
139370,"I have been taking these supplement for a couple of years now. However, Its hard to know if its working or not but I am feeling ok, so I guess its working.",4
129759,"This was not what I thought I ordered. I had thought I was ordering ones I could put through my printer. The fault was mine, I didn't fully read the product information. That being said these were fantastic to hand write for a different occasion.",4
150638,Bracelet was a little smaller than anticipated. Quality was good. However shipping took longer than stated. Missed mothers day by almost a week.,4
125028,"I got them to use in my classroom, but the adhesive was meh and the led light would starts to fade in brightness after about five minutes. I use them around my house now for closets (less time used), so not a total bust.",4
141165,"Great form fitting case. It is a non slip sand paper feeling case that won't scratch your phone. My phone is protected all around the edges, and it looks slim and feels great. When it's dirty I just wash it with soapy water and a gently brush it then drip dry it upside down. Although it needs more colors in the non slip model. :-)",4
149104,"Easy installation and function. Four starr reasoning is one lock mechanism has a concerning ""feel"" to is when pressed in to lock. It locks and unlocks fine, however, just don't have the right feel and won't ""click"" when it locks like the other one.",4
120109,Love it! Everyone at the office loves it too.,4
120907,Little small but great product,4
147614,Loved the concept... lil flowers fell off at times... lights lasted all nite,4
129562,Looks a little small for my hens.,4
159684,"Nice bag. A bit smaller than anticipated, but sufficient for a small laptop or tablet.",4
131254,I have received the iPad and it was in very good condition but i didn't receive the charger that was my only issue in this iPad Air,4
138176,This is the first book dealing in Anarchy. Interesting new characters and a suspenseful plot. As every Perry novel a good read.,4
151493,Great packaging! Includes all ingredients,4
145661,Not as happy with these as the pair of UA pants I purchased.,4
133324,"This is book is straightforward with significant data, you just can't overlook, get it and begin playing, I know I will do it when I discover a guitar!Recommended it to all.",4
153364,I have two sets of these and really like them. I play bass and keyboards so sometimes I need to let my bass hang behind me to play keys and I've never doubted these locks to hold it up. The only thing to watch for is sometimes the pull-pin will get loose and needs to be checked and finger-tightened periodically.,4
120572,I like the design but it’s a little heavy and peeled my wall paper.,4
159142,Replacement product seems to be working well. Keeping perfect time and dispensed food as it should.,4
