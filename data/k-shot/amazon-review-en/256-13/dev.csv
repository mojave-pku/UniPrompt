Not only does it not smell the same, it's extremely hard and difficult to get out of the container. I've had to use a knife or spoon to chip away at it, then try to warm it in my hands. And even then, there are still some tiny hard pieces left that don't melt. I don't know if it's an old container or if it's the way they made it, but I won't be buying it again unless they change the formula.",2
69793,"I grew tired of replacing the incandescent bulbs under my microwave (an over-the - range unit) and thought LED bulbs would last longer and save energy. The light wasn't quite as ""soft"" as I thought it would be but I could get over that. There was no observable blinking like you sometimes see with LEDs, which is a plus. However.... To give some context, the microwave has a bright setting and a nightlight setting. After about a month one of the bulbs stopped getting brighter when the bright setting was selected. A couple of weeks later the other bulb would not get brighter when set on the bright setting. Both bulbs still worked on the dim setting but not the bright. Am disappointed because I replaced these with incandescent bulbs that lasted about 3 months. I think part of it is the bulbs experience a lot of heat being over a gas range.",2

I bought this specifically so I didn't have to purchase a converter as well as an adapter and I still wouldn't be able to use it without having both! Misleading title!! Proves that you have to read every single buried description before purchasing which of course, is extremely time consuming when you are comparing an endless list of similar products. Obviously they know this and put misleading information in the title in the hopes that people won't bother to read everything at the bottom nor take the time to return the item!",2
68062,"The product itself serves it's purpose for the short time I will need it. But in all honestly it's not made very well. Besides the fact that one of the zippers get stuck, It's too small to fit the entire infant seat. It doesn't reach from top to bottom. It only stays put on there because I'm able to hook it on the shade part on the top. Even then it has huge gaps on the side which is no good in Chicago winters and I have to use another cover over the top so wind doesn't blow through it.",2

Normally I can start and finish a good book in a few hours, this one literally took days. I picked it up, read a bit and couldn't take it anymore, so I put it down. I did this for several days but was determined to finish it. I think what bothered me the most, and it was so hard to get past it, was all the stupid nicknames! Overkill! I got so tired of these adults calling each other childish nicknames, not just one, but several for each family member! But to each his own and it looks like a lot of people loved the book, good for you, honestly. I just can't rate it higher than 2 stars, the nicknames killed it for me.",2

It does not puncture a large enuff hole in the bottom of the cup causing the brewer to stop with a malfunction warning. Had to expand the hole either by using a knife or predrilling the bottom of the cup so that it would fit in the pod holder. So, while the coffee is great, Keurig users should be aware that the cup may not operate properly in the machine. Would not purchase again just for that reason.",2

45903,"I regret buying this vacuum. You get what you pay for. This is made of cheap plastic, the extendable hose can hardly be called an extendable hose -- it is about 3 feet long and has no ""extension"" to it. The attachments don't have a place to ride on the back of the machine and are extremely awkward to use -- with a very short, stiff hose and long plastic attachments that don't bend, it is very awkward to use the wand. The vacuum does not auto-propel and each time you change surfaces (e.g. if you're vacuuming a hardwood floor with a rug on it), you have to stop and change the height setting. There is no good place to wind the cord, and the hose frequently pulls out its insert slot on the back. The vacuum does not lay flat so you cannot vacuum under furniture The positives I can say about this vacuum are that: 1) it is lightweight 2) it has good suction I should have spent more money in the first place and bought a better vacuum. Instead, I'm going to be wringing my hands waiting until I can replace this one.",2

58163,"Headphones were good, while they worked. They are really bass-heavy so if you are looking for that, they are a good choice. They don't hold odor like other headphones I have used. The problems I encountered are what I took off three stars for. Out of blue, the headphones failed to hold a charge. Using the wiring provided I am unable to charge the headphones. No maltreatment from me has caused this. They fail to charge even when using different methods, like a different USB outlet. Another issue is that the wired functionality failed. The sound constantly switches from left ear to right ear depending on which way the wire is facing. This also seemed to happen without any cause. I am also unable to purchase any separate cables from the website. Wouldn't recommend your purchase these.",2
55677,"I bought this based on the ATK recommendation and the unavailability of their top option. I think they got it wrong for once. The scrubber pads only lasted 2 uses before the outer layer was fraying and coming off. Metal shavings were exposed making it no better than a normal metal bristle scrubber. The pad is also very loose in the holder and doesn't allow for scrubbing of caked on messes, it just rips more. The cleaner itself does even work that well on cast iron grates like those found on the Weber Genesis II and Spirit II. It was much more effective for cleaning my stainless grates on the upper platform on my grill. I would highly recommend against this product.",2

Live view has taken as long as 1 minute to connect (which makes it worthless). It isn't my router or wireless system either. Only THIS has problems with my signal. And I DID try their chime pro for upping signal. It didn't work either. I am now rethinking the whole brand. This is not reliable security which in some ways is worse than no security. For the price and PITA installing and so on I think this needs to go back. I'd rather pay 4X the cost for something RELIABLE than something you cannot depend on to work when needed.,2

I use a Samsung s7 for work for 2 years, it's been dropped, and banged a lot everyday, no issues with screen at all, might just be a bad Motorola product.

I even tried switching tops with bases. Eventually, I gave up, after only fitting 8/12 together. I expected all of them to be easy to assemble. In the end, I chose to disassemble them and use the bottoms as drink cups. If I had that much difficulty putting them together in the first place, imagine how difficult it would be for someone to assemble it after they put a drink in it. It may not be a big deal if your party is outdoors, but ours was rained out. Inside, I was too worried that we would have multiple spills on the carpet.

Stops working on occasion too and thats frustrating for the end user. They should be sold for $9.99 because that's what they are worth. I would go name brand or even Amazon Basics over this model. It looks great but that's about all",2
60503,The fiber optic doesn't work. There is no light.,2
56820,"For $70, this is a rip off. My nephew played it for about 10 minutes and was done with it. Cheaply made and now that I've seen it, I'd be hard pressed to pay $7 for it.",2
51107,I liked how it was packaged but was thinking it was a little bigger than it looked.It seemed not made to well on the quality but it did do the job.,2

60376,"I wanted to love this book. American historical, esp. mail-order bride, is one of my favorite genres. This one is not well-researched. There were glaring time-period mistakes and I had trouble getting past them. To add to that the relationship between the main characters is unbelievable. There's a notable lack of dramatic tension and honestly, I just didn't care if they got their HEA or not. Personally, editorial errors do not bug me. I can read past typos, but errors in basic story-telling...nope.",2
59712,Very flimsy and I thought I was buying chrome and it was blue,2
73991,I order the blue color and it came in two different shades of blue. I’m going to return this merchandise.,2
71660,I bought this for my daughter as a gift. I had it shipped to her and it arrived broken. Now she has to go through the hassle of returning her broken gift.,2
49629,Bought for my companies conference/flex meeting space so we could easily roll projectors and laptops in and out of room. Rolling it along and a wheel hit a floor outlet and the wood base split and wheel fell. Can not be easily repaired. Trying to contact Amazon but the product page is down!,2

41249,"The bands look great and my boys love them however after a few weeks the bands started coming off while my kids are wearing them, now they are coming off daily. I thought the quick release would make for an easy install but it’s not with them continually coming off while in use.",2

52097,Works but camera is pretty blurry. Would not recommend.,2
52505,Arrived very promptly and took me 2 mins setup. Very slick design and comfortable to the ears. Update: Left earplug is not synchronizing with the right earplug anymore although the left earplug is turning ON. No help from customer service yet.,2

52806,I bought this copy of Valerian as I have seen the movie and liked it. Bought it as it said it had a digital copy but does not as it is the Canadian version and unless you live in Canada you can't redeem the digital version. If you are looking for both the movie and digital redeem forget this one as unless you live in Canada you are just buying the disc.,2

58582,I don't think these do much of anything. The directions said to take the unit apart after 5 days and run water over....too much maintenance for this kind of item ... who remembers to do stuff like that?,2
73740,"In some cases like this, you get what you pay for. Although these extensions are true to color, length, and fullness, they will not respond to styling with heat. I began trying to curl them in short intervals to see how they'd respond. With no curl or even wave to them, I held them in the curler longer. After about 40 seconds, they started to smell as if they were melting, and still no curl! If you plan to wear them straight, I think it's a decent purchase. They are very thick, good quality, and the clips are sewn in well. No complaints there, but unfortunately they are useless for me since I prefer to have them curled/wavy.",2
49619,would not buy again. cheap quality better to buy more expensive one than waste money on this product cheap hard thin plastic better quality found in a dollar store,2

71942,This unit is only good to ensure proper wiring.,2
44366,I bought it so I could brush her while i'm petting her. It doesn't really work that way I can't get the nubs down in her coat to really get the hair off. It's also kinda big for my little hands so that makes it more challenging to get good contact with the loose hair in her coat.,2

55688,"It's a jacket that fits well and is accurate to the sizing. While the jacket has four breather holes underneath the arms on each side, it does not breathe well. As far as rain protection goes the jacket does exactly what it's supposed to do, it keeps the rain out. However I'm sweating so heavily inside this thing that I might as well not be wearing it. When I take it off my shirt is completely soaked. I'm wearing this in weather that's anywhere from 25 degrees Fahrenheit to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. I can't imagine wearing this thing in warmer weather without turning into a swampy mess. The jacket's very attractive and it looks great it just performs poorly in terms of its breathability.",2
57863,Eh.... The nose piece is uncomfortable... I got some different goggles and gave these to my daughter.,2

53782,"I loved this pillow for the stripes. It worked well on the sofa in a room of neutrals. However, it faded horribly within a couple of months. I washed on gentle cycles inside out, hung to set. Still, in less than a year, it needs to be replaced.",2
53109,"Item shows 4 different colors in the multi-pack, but I received 2 black and 2 grey pairs.",2

42755,"Once again a book written for those who essentially are beginning in BDSM. If you are, this book will for sure help you understand the core of the lifestyle, but then again, 90% of BDSM books written will do the same. I bought this book hoping it would cater more to those who do have some experience and are looking to advance their knowledge and skills. This book just repeats what the other 90% of the books do. The last part of the book was interesting. Dealing with the Dark and spiritual side of BDSM. I found that to be an interesting read. I just wish BDSM authors would stop turning out the same info book after book and hat someone would write a book that focuses on advance BDSM not beginner.",2
58512,"Item was not shipped with adequate protection in the box, and two legs were crushed on the ends.",2

48272,"Bought April 2017, it is now Sept 2018 and the amp is bad. No sound coming out. Nothing. I spent so much money installing these speakers and the amp and now the amp went bad. I hardly used the bike in general and am incredibly disappointed.",2
64354,Received the wrong product. Ordered lotion but got shampoo..even was labeled incorrectly.,2
78174,Why was the barcode on the box covered???,2
71320,Extremely poor quality. It is not made of wood. It is pressed cardboard. Needless to say it looks as bad as it is.,2
46293,"This documentary could have been condensed into a one hour program if its redundancy were eliminated. The same statements are repeated over and over again which makes the film boring and sluggish. I think a lot of people, myself included, suspected MJ was a pedophile. This movie doesn’t prove or disprove that theory. The most difficult thing to wrap my head around is the mother’s infatuation with the fame and glamorous life that went along with pimping their sons out to MJ. What mother allows their child to sleep with a 33 year old man? SMH.",2
67196,Way too difficult to use and cheaply made.,2

72794,"The frame arrived with all sorts of scuffs around the frame itself due to packaging. The damages were heavily on the corners, which is where the frame is secured in at during shipping. While it's not noticeable at a far, far distance, it was still irritating to receive something we were expecting to be a crisp solid black color, and have it arrived scuffed. It's a good deal for a frame, and processed very quickly, but I could not use this for framing a gift I wanted to give. Had to find a frame locally to replace this one. Image attached.",2
52637,Worked great but the top strap has already ripped off the top in less then 2 months.,2
62798,I bought this to store my cords during travel but the case could barely fit the wall plugs for the cords. After two attempts the zipper came apart.,2
56533,I really like these nails. They fit perfect and look great. They are not thin like other false nails. They are very sturdy. Only thing is they do not provide nail glue. They just provide sticky nail bonding strips. I used my own nail glue. Which I recommend. But I love these nails will be ordering again for my vacation. Update: I have bought these nails three times now. Each time I have been able to keep this nails on for almost a month. I will not buy any other false nails after using this one. I only wish they had other colors. But I just ordered the nails again. They sent me a different type that is thinner and not as durable. I am very disappointed & I will not be purchasing again.,2

76868,I take special care of my electronics and this cable was no exception. No bends or twists. This cable suddenly stopped charging one day.

At first i thought it was my screen protector that was too bulky but when i took it off to see it still kept popping open. I'm able to keep it closed for for 5 seconds before it opens again.

I think I add 10 minutes to my makeup routine just trying to separate my lashes and get the clumps off. And it makes my lower and upper lashes stick together and that makes me crazy! It's also super hard to remove. I'm sure it takes off lashes each time. Soap and water doesn't do the trick so I have to use makeup remover. It takes forever!",2

75572,"The product arrived with the battery missing. On further investigation, I learned that it doesn't come with a battery. You have to order the battery and charger separately, and they cost more than the trimmer! This information should have been made more obvious in the product description.

We hand wash these also and no measure of abuse can be identified during their use at home. We find the larger whisk to be too flimsy and smaller ones good enough. However, they all have experienced random loss of the silicon material from around the wires.....just small sections from the ends closest to the handles.

Only after a couple of weeks, the left ear bud would no longer hold a charge for more than 15 minutes or so. According to my dad, the sound quality was good and they fit really well.

74502,Not worth it as the stains don’t go out easily,2
44593,I was really excited to try this out as I had been receiving a ton of ads for Brickell. Unfortunately this was a major let down as it is very liquidy and I feel like it doesn’t get a good scrub and clean. Kiehls face wash is much better,2

46043,"I'm a Troy-Bilt guy. My old trimmer lasted about 12 years and I had all the attachments so I wanted to stay with the same brand. Bottom line is that this is not a good product. The engine is extremely cold natured meaning that without the electric starter you can forget it starting before you end up with blisters from the pull cord. Once it warms up (and it takes a while) it is not half bad. But the killer is the trimmer head and trying to restring it. I'm not an angry or violent man, but just yesterday I had to walk away after 20 minutes before I just smashed this thing to pieces. The instructions are completely wrong....there is physically no way to string this thing as they say as the string cannot pass through. The old head was a bit of a pain, but it worked. This you have to take a screwdriver, pry (i.e., bend the heck out of it) to get it apart and then you have to wind both sides (one on top, one on bottom), then pray that you can line it back up and snap it back together. It's probably a two to three person job to be honest. When you get it started and warmed up and it's got a full head it works. It's just frustrating to spend more time putting string in this thing than actually time spent using it. I am definitely in the market for an aftermarket head right now.",2
45315,Definitely not what I expected. Cheap material and I couldn’t even wear them for the event I needed them for.,2

59856,Maybe I just got a defective package but these wouldn't stick. The adhesive wouldn't hold in place in underwear. I'd pull the strip off and press onto underwear and before I could pull them up the pad was peeling up. This was incredibly annoying. I don't know how absorbent they are since they didn't stay in well. I'd put one in try to hold it in place to get underwear up so I could get dressed to go out but since every time you went to the bathroom the pad peeled up so you had to try to press and hold it to get your underwear up again. As soon as possible after returning home the pad went in the garbage. I like the length but are a little bulky for me. I might try again so see if what I got was just not right but not any time soon,2

Does it come with this particular item that I'd purchased? Update: It's been 2 weeks already and I haven't heard from this company. I'm kind of disappointed. The money I spent of this is eh. Now that I've had it for 2 weeks, it does make the screen darker and I always find myself turning up the brightness on my screen.

The only weird thing was I got it in a box that I didn't think would fit such a fluffy jacket until I opened it and saw they had vacuum-sealed it and I was confused for a bit about what it was that I received. It wasn't wrinkled or anything and I just had to fluff it back up",5

172077,"It's hard to wear sunglasses. I put them in my wallet, put them on my head, throw them into the car and throw them down. I wear sunglasses all year, so I often need new ones. These glasses are cheap and inexpensive. These wires will hold me for up to a few months before they break. Rubber will last longer and it looks like I can drop them several times. So why are five-star reviews? I expect this quality at this price (Golden Day). They look cute, fit well and shine on my face. In fact, all sunglasses on Amazon are the same, just different sellers, so when I lose them or sit on them, I will move on without any tears. A product that is worth purchasing. It's worth trusting.",5

But i requested her to try for a night. And she did it. She had a continuous long sleep for hours. She was amazed how it happened. Everynight she goes to bed at 9 pm but falls asleep at around 1 or 2 am everyday. This night, she felt asleep at 10 pm and woke up at 5 am dreaming all night. I came to conclusion that the position of her sleep was not good enough before, and this pillow aligned her position. Also because of the softness of the pillow and air passage, it made her feel comfortable. Now, she is getting better sleep everyday. Thanks for the company who manufactured this magic pillow.",5

Unless you already do a lot of yoga you will probably feel silly and off-balance at first, but I highly recommend you keep at it. I roll around on this for maybe a few minutes every night, not even a long time, and I'm really starting to notice a difference. My left hand was starting to have tingling in my index and middle finger--that's gone now! My core muscles are starting to improve a bit because I'm a lot more steady when I use the wheel. My shoulders are feeling a little looser (my right one still has a ways to go, but I'm pretty confident if I keep using it It will keep feeling better and better). I used to have back pain doing certain activities, and while I still struggle with it from time to time I've noticed I can work a lot longer before I start encountering pain; for example, leaning over the counter to prepare dinner, or walking/being on my feet for long periods of time. It's also really nice to use to stretch out if I wake up with stiff shoulders or start to notice my back pain flaring up. I seriously love this thing!!!",5

I would take off a half star because no matter how you adjust the straps, they do dig in under the arms.There is add-on padding, but I've found that adding them on is kind of an annoyance and leaving them on doesn't work really well as they move around and are hard to adjust for the next wearing.

I did a copy of my old HHD into the new SSD with a SATA (that by the way is not included, you have to purchase it separately) after that I installed the SSD in my computer and the magic happened, now is faster and quicker almost like a new one.

177437,"We spend a couple weeks on vacation every year. In past years, we have had friends or hired pet sitters to come by daily (sometimes twice daily) to feed our cats. This year, I thought there's got to be some value provided by an automatic pet feeder, so we took the plunge and bought this PetSafe unit. I had read the reviews where people complained about one push of the button not completely priming the feed conveyor and other complications people had encountered getting the device on wifi, etc. My experience with this product is that it is entirely intuitive for a reasonable consumer. If you've ever put a device like an Amazon Echo or a wireless laser printer on your home wifi network, the setup for this feeder is no different. The app is very intuitive and there is an option front-and-center for priming the feed conveyor with a single click within the app. We have been using the feeder for more than a month set with a daily schedule of two feedings. One at 6:00 AM and one at 5:30 PM. This works great for our two cats. The kibble does make noise when it falls into the bowl, and that's why I selected these times-- it decreases the likelihood the cats will be nearby when the feeding occurs. We have had zero jams in our usage and I'll update this review if we encounter any in the coming years. For future trips, we will have a webcam pointed at the feeding station so we can monitor the bowl remotely and send a friend over to attend to any jams should they occur while we're away. Finally, my only concern with this device is that it is dependent on the vendor's cloud infrastructure. If the company goes out of business, this device will cease to work",5

I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants great headphones.,5

177141,"Finally the bowl is off the counter. This caddy holds more, is easy to use and clean. In the first photo you can see how low my sink is, so to clear it the caddy is mounted below the thick part of the frame on the cabinet. Since it needed to be mounted to the thin panel in the center I used velcro. It works great and won't leave any holes in the cabinet. This is a really great product. My only wish would be to have a side handle or grip like a pitcher on the bucket itself so I could open my compost bin lid with one hand and dump the caddy with the other. This caddy takes two hands to dump.",5

Warm material but not to an excessive level. I like the fact that this masks keeps me warm yet doesn't make me sweat. Eye hole is not too big like some can be to the point of it slipping over your nose. Even though it's ment for a motorcycle, It also is perfect for outdoor work in the cold.

176010,Wow! This little flashlight sure packs a punch for the buck. I heard about these flashlights from my son. After ordering them I was amazed at the power these little lights have.

166848,"It's that time of year where I needed new shorts but the stores have decided that they are only selling long sleeve fleece since fall has officially started. They seem to forget that it is still 90 degrees here, so I need shorts for a few more months, not fleece. I have never ordered clothing from Amazon before, but turned here out of desperation since I couldn't find any shorts in store or online anywhere. I went with these since they were a reputable brand and had awesome reviews, and I am thrilled with them. They are comfy and have a decent bit of movement to the fabric. The length is longer than what I normally find in the store, but it is a good length and I had no problem rolling the bottom up a little to fit even better. They are slightly snug on the hips, but not uncomfortable, so I would say they are pretty true to size. They look well made and I'll update this review if I notice any bad fading after washing them, but I expect they'll last pretty well. Overall I am super impressed and will definitely consider buying other pieces of clothing from amazon in the future.",5
198060,"I didn’t dislike anything in this book I loved this 8 year old child, he was so smart and lovable,I really liked his relationship with Izzy. I would recommend this to all my friends that still like to read.",5
188956,"Just recieved mine. No complaints. If you haven't bought this yet just know that the material isn't stretchy to immediately fit your arm. Which is a good thing in my opinion. You can have the bracelet loose, fit, or tight.",5

39605,It didn't last long now i.have to buy another on so dissappointed,1
14104,I purchased this in late Oct. and opened the box last night. The unit would not turn on even though it was fully charged. I would return it but since it was purchased almost three months ago that is not possible.,1
33399,This was not a good product. Very difficult to install. I got so frustrated I ordered another one from a different company,1
1810,Each sponge came off the base within a few days. One came off on its first use. Very poor quality. I would not recommend.,1
37620,"Only good thing I can say about these tongue rings are that they arrived fast. The quality is poor and not to mention I got 4 of the same exact design and a couple of the others had 2 of the same. Also, there was two missing. Needless to say I will definitely be returning these.",1
32034,I only had this case for two weeks and with one drop it came apart and my phone has a crack now in the screen at the bottom right corner. And scratches on the corners....FML,1
17,Beautiful way. Does not stay paired with or connected to my daughter’s iPhone. Essentially useless other that to tell time.,1
13143,It's the worst things I ever purchased. I'll never buy any jewelry from Amazon again. It's very descriptive to sell those things and call it jewelry.,1
19853,"These are AWFUL. They DO NOT dry! It's been 40 minutes since I printed, and the label is smudged and still smudging if touched. If you have hours to wait, perhaps it dries. I know that I'm too busy to do this with every item I need to ship being a business owner. Very disappointed.",1

10658,Poor quality can’t put in drier have to lay flat,1
12909,Provides bogus tracking numbers. Promises delivery in two days - takes money and does not ship in time frame. AVOID,1
17099,I was really disappointed in these headphones they were very uncomfortable and the sound was so bad like a weird sound I returned them also don't make the same mistake and buy them and then return them you have to pay out of your pocket to return that's bull,1
33897,Its difficult to install & couldn't figure it out and what part i did figure out it doesn't work for our services,1
10921,The cartridge seemed great at first but ironically as soon as the return/issue window closed we started getting spots and lines on printouts. Not on every page but always when I was trying to print an important document! So annoying! Will definitely not be using or recommending this product. Stick to OEM product for good results.,1
5673,"May be my fault, but when trying to use this to charge and Anker speaker or Anker battery this cord is hit or miss. Seems to not seat properly *sometimes*",1
11155,It started out working well but after a few months began to stick. The problem became worse over time and after a year I hated it and donated the pan. I would never buy another pan like this.,1
33180,Worst cover I’ve ever seen. I bought this so I could keep my car at my parents while on vacation for 3 weeks. After 2 weeks my dad contacted me to let me know the cover was ripped and shedding a powder from the top layer.,1
34202,"This review is for Amazon shipping department vs. the product line. I like this product so order it often from another source with no issues. Tried Amazon to save on shipping costs...Two shipped, one arrived completely damaged and unusable. They came together in the same package so the only way this could have happened is if one was dropped prior to it going into the box for shipping. I use this product all the time and the only way for it to break like that is if you drop it on the floor or if it's old/past it's shelf life. Worse part is that there was no option available to return it or file a claim. Will go back to my previous vendor and just pay for shipping.",1
4691,It's not looks like web photo.,1
31931,"Have bought this at Amazon before woth no problems....it was time for a new bottle, happened to read reviews before buying that talked about people getting imitation bottles but decided to buy any way because of no issues before. Received an imitation. Amazon is awesome though, called them and they took care of issue. Won’t be buying this anymore though.",1
28726,Never could get it to show performances,1
15380,Pour the cat food in and get disappointed immediately. The food pours into the bowl rapidly and does not stop. My cat will eat everything immediately and then puke. I can only use this to feed one normal portion. So...what’s the point? I will just trash it. Not worth my time and effort to return it!!,1
3578,"Product was not what was advertised, the black/pink one I order is supposed to have a grey fuzzy type fabric on the inside and instead it has a the black non fuzzy inside that is shown in one of the other jackets. Super disappointed with this fact as the reason I bought it was bc it had a warmer type of insulation.",1
23840,I sent a message saying it arrived cracked. I will send it back when you send me a new one!,1
11665,Received in April and it’s broken already. Too late to return. Replaced the batteries with new batteries. No power,1
25292,"I received this product with the top broken. I don't know if that happened in the possession of the shipper or the vendor. However, because it was broken (and Shea Butter turns to liquid at high temperatures), when I received it there was more Shea Butter in the bag than in the container. Going forward, I will only buy from a local store to avoid this happening again.",1
17504,Did nothing... Absolutely nothing. Very discouraged and disappointed.,1
36878,This trap never killed anything. The light would go on at times but never anything inside and often the bait was gone. I changed batteries twice to see if that was the problem. Nothing worked. I have tried several of these electronic rat traps over the years. Many years ago the old rat zapper worked really well. I have not found anything that works since then..including the new rat zappers. Not sure what the problem is????,1
13313,Came with missing pieces that you need to put this together so I sent it back and went with something else very disappointed,1
18035,"I purchased this product with hopes it would be useful in repairing antique picture frames. I found it absolutely useless. The plastic corner blocks bend when tightened down and slip off when tightening the screw rods. This might be useful if you’re making a 5” x 5” frame, but I doubt it. Don’t waste your money!",1
12206,"This seller is selling counterfeit wubbanub products. The dead give away is the packaging, but when you inspect further you notice the pacifier itself is nothing like the authentic ones in stores. BEWARE - This probably may be defective, poisonous, or god knows what",1
27767,"We're nurses, we're careful, we know how to wash our hands and this didn't come into contact with water. Stopped working after about a week or so. Changed the batteries (that we brand new initially), after changing them this dispenser still didn't work. Turned on and soap came out once and that was it. Maybe the sensor is broken? I have no clue. Now I have to bother to return it! WASTE OF TIME!",1
28060,The sponge fell off on the first use. The second one is loose after one use and coming off. Very poorly made. I have one from dawn that is years old and still has the old sponge on it. Very disappointed.,1
33358,Would not recommend. There’s no option for battery and it is wobbly. Waste of money if you ask me.,1
6796,Might work for dog dish ?? (or poultry) not 5 gal buckets.,1
7065,"Trust the other one star reviews, and don't waste your money on this. After fully charging the battery for the first time and using only a couple times, the battery just stopped holding a charge.",1
31325,"So at first this thing is great. Decent fit, doesn't stretch your fingers too much. But after about 2 or 3 months... Not so much. It falls off a lot, stopping it from charging unless you hold it super tight... Which means leaving it on the batter pack to to charge won't work. I leave it on overnight, not having multiple spots open to charge it, the switch, my phone, and my kindle... And it doesn't charge itself and the switch because it just falls out of the slot. Sucks. A lot. Works great at first but quickly loses its use. Which sucks. I work overnights and its pretty dead so I play some when I have downtime but this kinda sucks now. Need a new one.",1
28829,Very poorly built. it broke the first time i played music through it.,1
28166,None of the three can be unscrewed. I have to pur it into another working bottle.,1
39602,I don't subscribe to a cable/satellite provider. Provides very limited access to shows without a subscription. Would gladly pay a small monthly fee for access.,1
16621,It stopped working after a a few uses.,1
22457,Poorly made. Looks better in picture. Cheap looking when you open it up.,1
21653,Caution! The headphones breaks very easily! It extends the arm but if you try to open the headphones to put them on the arm breaks. I bought a pair with similar design from a different company for my other child and it never breaks so I believe these are simply cheap quality. Don’t buy these!!,1
18237,Very disappointed bought in November 2018 and light went out April 6 th 2019 changed the bulb and still doesn't work very unhappy. Something called the ballast might have gone bad which I hear finding a new one is difficult and is very pricey to replace.,1
14292,"This is not authentic, I purchased this product in a retail store, then purchased it from this site online. There is no comparison. The bottle looks almost identical, but the moisturizer is a different color. At least if they are putting a product in the Neutrogena bottle, they ought to try to make it the same color",1
15834,"The picture shows the old pacifier they used to carry and it Came with their new updated pacifier which my baby will not take, the only reason I bought this was because they no longer sale the old style pacifier and i was thinking this came with that one because of the picture",1
22841,all it did for my dogs is nothing I will say don't buy it,1
17241,i could not figure out how to connect this to my friends sena. When on phone call its really hard to hear. I am very disappointed in this item as i purchased this instead of the sena because of the reviews. i am returning it and will save up for new helmet or sena.,1
29034,Wrong size. Did not work for me,1

17170,better solutions out there. Still had to hack it open to make my door speakers sound good. Save your money & avoid.,1
7603,"It appears as if someone had previously opened the box, because there was a lot of tape on the outside of the box. I opened up the inside box, and only one of the glasses was broken. They were carefully wrapped, so how did one of them get broken unless someone had previously opened the box.",1
19114,"Don't buy this product, if you are looking for a new item and/or with apple warranty. This is a used product, even though they did not mention this in the item description.

21379,"No instructions came with this product. The gate wouldn’t stand up when I got it together. Went back into the bag, haven’t used it. Glad it didn’t cost a lot!!!",1

19427,"SO far there is little that can be wrong about anything ""Q"" related. The item is just small than anticipated and no value considering the price. Would look elsewhere for better price-to-size ratio. Have not put it on a window to know the quality of it sticking. The vinyl adhesive quality is awful!! Did not transfer/adhere properly. Do not buy.",1
11381,This is the single worst item I have purchased on Amazon. It came with holes in the pockets. The stitching ripped apart after one day. It was the only thing I had with me to keep me warm and the holes in the jacket let the wind and snow right through. Buyer beware.,1

20743,This product was so weak that it wouldn't even kill the damn flies all it would do is knock them out for a couple of seconds just for them to get up and fly away I highly recommend you do not waste your money on this product,1

26650,Items were not delivered. US Postal said boxes too heavy. Why do you use USPS? Why do they accept your shipments?,1
16958,When I put them in the aquarium they worked for a day or two and then they got water locked no matter how much I tried to tighten them and when I took them out they were full of mold,1
36287,"I like this one because it is unique. The problem is I used it 3 times before it started leaking water. It appears to be coming from the bottom. As soon as I turn it on it starts leaking. I want to return it for a replacement. Thank you, Ruby Wright",1
28313,"Waaaaaay too small. Doesnt stretch at all either. Im 5'2"" 100 lbs and a medium was too small. Not worth the return. Just gonna trash it.",1
8655,"this knob matched the one that came from the manufacturer so I guess I am not surprised that is broke in the same way as the original. Did not even last a week, Don't buy",1
10713,We have had this lunch box for about a month & a half now and the back seam has split and the zipper fell off.,1
20650,No exterior protective packaging. Product came partially opened due to flimsy box. Damp as well. How much would it have cost for them to put some brown paper around it rather than just slapping a mailing sticker on the red and black displaying box? Haven’t used the product yet to determine quality of the warmer itself.,1
32122,"I bought this for an outdoor cat that has tapeworms (I visibly see the segments pass). I followed the directions and gave it for the directed amount of time 3 times a day. I tried to drop the medicine directly into the cats mouth, that didn't go over well. My cat ate the medicine when I dropped it on a piece of lunch meat. Within a week of finishing giving her the medicine I found tapeworm segments again.",1
37352,The dress was very disappointing. Not well made but I guess you get what you pay for.,1

23635,Only worked about two weeks,1
31270,"Do not buy! The quality of the item is very poor, I should have listened to previous reviewers. 2 of these lights stopped working almost immediately. Today is exactly 5 months after these lights were bought and none of them works. I have different solar lights in the same location as these and they work fine, so the problem is not in the lack of the sun during the day.",1
39923,Book came with code already exposed. I tried code on website and was told it has already been used!,1
36689,"I do not know anything about the product as far as baking. I bought it as a present for a friend who loves to cook. It came without the box shown, just in a brown outside carton that is usually used for shipping, so that there is no clear explanation about the contents. It may be OK for you, but if you're giving it as a gift, I would not recommend it.",1

28198,One star for timeliness but Received empty package no sheets. WTF Utopia Deals?,1
28131,"I am not a fan of this puzzle brand. The pieces are nearly all the same shape. They must be aware of this since they print letters (A,B,C,D etc) on the back of the puzzle so you can at least sort the pieces by location. Often, something that seems to fit doesn't really if you look on the back. I love difficult puzzles, but these are just frustrating and not fun.",1
29789,I was blinging out a pair of converse sneakers. This is nothing more than a stick with wax on the end and not long into the process the wax fell off and the wouldn't stick to the stick. I don't recommend this for that kind of project. I wasted my money.,1

19110,"I was so excited to try this after reading all the reviews, but wow I tried this in two sizes and it was awful both times. I'm 5'9"" 170lb and ordered an M and an L. They both came up under my bra which was great, but the thong piece was cut in the wrong place. The seam cut directly across my hips/love handle area and gave me an insane bulge which looked awful. I usually prefer thong style shapers because I find them more comfortable, but this was so awkward and ill fitting. If you mostly need compression through your stomach/waist this would probably work for you, but if you hold any fat around your hips or have love handles this is probably not going to fit.",1
6164,"I got these shoes for my daughter's birthday, but they broke the first time they were put on. She's only 26 pounds! Terrible. Edit: within an hour of my posting this another shoe broke. Bringing us to half of the pairs of shoes ruined before she'd owned them for 24 hours.",1

13201,"The first time I went to attach a snap, the tool broke in my hand, Threw the rest of the kit out, don't waste your money.",1
15539,Wifi is very flaky. I have 3 printers (2 brothers and this HP). Most of the time it needs rebooting or reset. Duplex printing quits working for no apparent reason and needs a reset/reinstall. Worked with HP a few times over the years (until I had support) to get updated drivers as solutions. This is trash or I would say not even worth the landfill. Look elsewhere if WIFI printing or Duplex is key. If you are on a wired LAN it may work.,1
8239,TERRIBLE !! Half the cans are ruined!! REFUND!,1
6525,"for a 24, 26, and 28” bundles are thin very disappointed ! :/",1
33870,Didnt like due to forgetting to grab remote to turn the off,1
23716,Sorry but if you sell a product that requires the buyer to do something to maintain it then you should include instructions not just a bag.,1
19679,I bought this product less than a month ago and the last 3 days I am unable to charge the battery case. I have tried using 5 different chargers and am very disappointed that the product stopped working less than a month after purchasing,1
7866,Already broke! I have had crock pots in the past for 10+ years!! I have had this approx a year and it stopped working . So disappointed!!,1
28377,This shirt is so cute but the quality is terrible. Very wrinkled and the button on the back popped off before even putting the shirt on.,1
24694,It peels off when i put a case on. Also don't provide useful tool and instruction to put on correctly,1
15754,Did not fit my tablet. Do not buy/,1
29746,Returned product. Dangerous laser,1
8296,I gave 3 stars instead of 5 because the longest charger broke when I placed the charging piece into my phone and I ordered specifically for the 10' cord but I love the color and I have 2 backups. the shipping was fast and the items were as described. Update: I updated my rating to a 1 because the 6' charging cord has now stopped working with normal use for a few days. I suggest saving your money and buying an OEM replacement cord or go to Best Buy.,1
6774,I never got it. Never received the dye despite being told it was delivered.,1
18191,If I did not have to give a star to leave this review I wouldn't had. These people send your SCREEN PROTECTOR in soft packaging and expect it not to be broke. After waiting 3 week s for the crap I'm highly upset about this.,1
9078,I'm sure some dogs may love this product but mine wouldn't have anything to do with it. Pet him twice and he went and hid. I also found out that my brother had the same issue with his dog.,1
27299,This pants fade real fast didn't last me one month before it started to change color .,1
19524,Wrong item for the truck,1
16617,Product was dirty as if it was previously worn!,1
34276,Have applied this product three times now and have not seen a decline in mosquitoes. I followed the manufacturers direction and did the first two applications 7 days apart. There was no rain between the first and second application. In the two weeks following the second application there did not seem to be any affect on the mosquito population so I applied a third time (so just two weeks after the second application). As of writing this it has been 4 days from that third application we are still seeing significant population of mosquitoes. Actually increased the concentration on the second and third application hoping this would ensure effectiveness. This product is a total write-off. $160 down the drain. Smells nice though.,1
15505,My product was missing some. I was 8 short !!!,1
3649,"I purchased 48 cups of Quaker Real Medleys ON PRIME DAY, 36 of the cups expire in 1 month!!! 1st of all I do not eat hot cereal every day, even if i did selling a ""non perishable"" product with only 30 days of shelf life IS A VERY POOR PRACTICE!!!!

26858,"I love these straws as I can reuse them over and over again. The problem is, what is marketed as an 11 inch straw only measures 10 inches. The package is also marked 11 inches. You can see from the photo the that the straws I just purchased is one inch shorter than my old straw which is 11 inches. You can also see on the back of the package it is labelled as 11 inches. If you don't need the extra inch I highly recommend these straws.",1
24218,Item requested did not have buckle. Its too short for my use. Nice quality though,1
10855,2-Day shipping was later changed to a week then package never arrived. Had to get a refund.,1

23498,I don't know how they took the pics (maybe fairy hands) the ice cubes are super small and the trays are super small,1
23327,Too much expensive. The same product available for 11.00 at walmart. It looks like now a days amazon prices are very high.,1
35576,"Love the variety, they run super small. They do not cover well.",1
994,I would not recommend this product. The cover was way too small and the flimsy zip broke. We had to put it together with safety pins.,1
24691,Wish I can give it a zero!! It came dirty with stains on it!!,1
23297,"My original review is below, but after having this for a while as a secondary seat only, I say don’t buy. You cannot get this seat tight, the latches are merely metal clips that bend too easy, and the base being flimsy only gets worse. My daughter sways in the back the whole time we drive. I’m actually trading this seat in to be recycled and replacing with another Graco. No way in heck this would last long term or in an accident. Not worth the risk! I purchased this seat to compare to a graco 4 ever all in one for quality and also fit. I have a 2014 Chevrolet 1500 crew cab truck, so space is tight from the rear facing seat to the back of the front seat. After having these seats side by side, I have to say the graco is worth every penny. It’s very solid in construction, no wobbling, quality fabrics. The plastics are quite a bit sturdier and not flimsy whatsoever. I don’t have any doubt that the 4 ever seat will last 10 Years. The safety first is a good seat, it’s just not on the level of the graco. The plastics are noticeably thinner, slight wobble, the fabrics are softer but don’t keep their shape (it came with the headrest crumpled up) and are warmer than the graco, something important to keep in mind for our Texas weather. The base on the safety first is narrow and sways on hard floor or car seats no matter how tight the belt is. For being taller in height, I’m surprised to find that the graco fits better in my truck. The safety first takes more room reclined, and has many less recline options. It’s also wider than the graco. Had my daughter not spit up on the safety first as I was testing it, I would return it and get another graco. The difference in price is well worth the quality. When it comes to budget, I just don’t think car safety is the pace to trim dollars. It’s important to note that the graco can serve as a backless booster and handle 20 pounds more. I’m hoping the safety first will last as a secondary seat, but for those shopping for a primary seat, please save your dollars and invest in the 4 ever. My vehicle and my husbands have quite a few safety features that not all vehicles may have, which is the only reason I’m comfortable keeping this seat.",1
20074,"The stones started falling off already Just arrived on Friday Sept. 7, 2018 It broke when I put my phone in it...my phone couldn't fit at all. Very cheap not worth the money",1
25047,"This item is a FAKE! I won't name the seller, but it was ""fulfilled by Amazon"" but when I went through the process to return the item the seller's name was provided. The lid is extremely difficult to screw on, the suction isn't correct--this is nothing like my other Hydro Flask lid on my wife's Hydro Flask. The item I received is hard molded plastic, very slick and the molding is off. Save yourself some heartache and move along because you'll just be pissed off as it takes you a minute or so just to screw it on your Hydro Flask. I hope Amazon cracks down on these fakes and removes them from the system.",1

He's constantly sticking his nose in other people's business and it's so disrespectful, but he thinks he's being ""cool"". It's Just obnoxious. He apparently doesn't know he's obnoxious, because he tells the story with pride. I'm starting the AT soon and hope I don't have to put up with clowns like this on the trail. Now that I've purchased the book I noticed other reviews are similar. I regret it.",1

26993,This product is horrible!! I’ve used kinesiology tape before and thought I’d try this one for a few less dollars. Big mistake!! I had a serious reaction to the tape. Blistering and now a scar. Called their customer service and was told the ingredients in tape. Rude service. Rep told me “good luck!” with return. Amazon refunded me so no issues. Contacted company by email suggesting they may want to list ingredients for those who might have allergic reactions. Rep said she would take suggestion and asked for photos of blisters. No mention of rude treatment or asked if I wanted a refund. Horrible product and horrible customer service!!! Thanks to Amazon for refund.,1

They stated it was the drivers error and they will correct the problem...well guess what...it happened again and is a birthday gift for my grand daughter. I've been purchasing from Amazon for years and never had any problems now this! Three times! Oh and we don't feel comfortable knocking on their door for personal reasons. Please refund me ASAP.,1

10148,Terrible product. The liner inside was so thin you could see through it and in some sheets there was NO liner. Very disappointed as I was in the middle of packing when I opened these. The first couple were just ok but my items were small enough that I could wrap the sheet around them two times. My intent had been to cut the sheets for the small items.

I thought my form was wrong, but upon further research, no, I was fine.

But what if you are starting on #10, or some other hole as is the case in a shotgun start?

5475,I got the biggest size just in case cause my child wears L so I got XXL but was waaayyy too small,1
18132,"This coffee is terrible! It has an odd taste. I'm really picky about my coffee. I don't like Starbucks or french roast. My taste buds prefer Original Duncan Donuts or McCafe. This taste something like a burnt french roast mixed with an unpalatable flavor. My children have a much wider range of coffee appreciation....and they all said it was terrible and threw out the samples I gave them! I hardly ever write reviews, so take that for what it is worth",1
12919,I purchased this for my husband because he goes through phones like crazy so I don't get expensive ones. It's been over a month but the phone is starting to heat up. It doesn't shut off when not in use. He gas trouble hearing people when they call him. It's past the time to return it so I just ordered him a new phone.,1
26909,The signal was too weak with these extensions.,1
24278,The sight arrived and it was not working. I opened it up and the battery had the sticker removed from it so I'm not sure if the sight is defective or not. I now have to go buy a new battery to verify if it works or not.,1
21911,"This might be good for other cracks, but does not work well for cracks in the corner. Also, the DVD instructions they sent did not work. I was able to find instructions on YouTube but I paid too much for the instructional DVD to not work.",1
22930,Cheap cheap looking. Never used.,1
20884,Super thin cheap material. Does not look like the picture that appears to have some form to it. Looks like a potatoe sack with American flag..straight cut.,1
39703,maybe it can be good. but i never got it,1
24607,I would buy this shirt 2 sizes bigger than you think you are. It shrinks a lot and the material is not soft. I honestly would recommend you not waste your money.,1
26547,False advertising...DO NOT PURCHASE!! They sent 1 toothbrush when I paid $13 for pack of 6.,1
36707,Don't buy. Supper watery can't work with it. Even for beginners.,1

11096,This broke and didn't even make it through one school year.,1
8040,"It doesn't adhere fully to my phone. I heard it make noise when I pressed it against the screen while it was applied. The touch sensitivity was good without any case. But when I put my otterbox defender case, it lost sensitivity. And there was a huge gap between the screen and the phone. I have returned it and ordered a better future tempered glass.",1
2820,Only works sometimes. Kept unplugging when in use.,1
150547,As noted in at least one other review product arrived with no top. When I have purchased this product in a pet store it has always had a top on it. This is my favorite aroma of the other colognes in this product line; last only a day or so which is disappointing.,4
136954,"I had prepared myself to not like this, and when I opened it, I thought, ""Why did I buy this thing....it isn't going to work."" Boy, was I surprised! I have a lot of hair....a LOT of hair, and it did a good job drying it well. The negative ions made an impact on the texture. Will I use this every day? I'm not sure, but I am traveling tomorrow and it is already packed in my bag.",4
145096,"I bought this for my dog who is about 6 pounds and so far he is tolerating being put in it. I on the other hand am thoroughly enjoying carrying around my little pup with me like a mother kangaroo. Also on a whim I decided to place my bigger dog who is maybe 15 pounds and weirdly enough he loved it! He fit into it perfectly, like a baby nestled comfortable in their mothers womb in month 7 of 9. The point is he wouldn't leave and I had to carry him around for a long time because he actually liked it. So overall it's pretty great and I'm looking forward to using it to protect my little dog from my brother's huge dogs over thanksgiving!",4
156644,Only thing I didn’t like was sides weren’t straight so when using to stack a cake not ideal. Otherwise work great,4
131384,I wish they made it bit thicker the steel beams.,4
121492,"This blanket is made of the usual Carhartt duck material that they use in their bibs and their sherpa material on the other side. The duck material is very durable and will last through years of abuse, while the sherpa material is very comfortable. I got it for my dogs to use around the house and on camping trips and they seem to like it so far. It seems a little pricey for the size and I would love to see it come in larger sizes, but I knew what I was getting when I ordered it, because the dimensions are clearly listed. I will say, the duck material bleaches out pretty quickly if left in the sun (as learned from leaving my Carhartt bibs in my Jeep for a few weeks), so be aware of that.",4
132844,So I like everything about it but it’s damn near impossible to keep junk out of the inside of the case,4
135535,"When I received the ring one of the stones was wrong, which could have been my fault. But I messaged the seller immediately after realizing and asked that the problem be fixed. The seller replied quick, and assured me that they will fix the problem. Which I great because I bought the ring for my mom. Wonderful problem solving on the businesses part. The ring is beautiful and I’m excited for it to be fixed so I can gift it to my mom.",4
157458,Good diverter. Make sure you have it level with your water barrel.,4
154065,"Way better than it has any reason to be for the price. Only annoying thing is how it seems to pick whatever mode it wants to, and the carrying bag is of useless quality. As a cheap clamp meter it is tough to beat this.",4
139774,"This case is great! Only thing I dislike is my magnetic mount struggles a bit due to the wide/smooth texture and the curved back-side. If they would have thought to install a thin metal plate inside of that curved material, and perhaps have said curved material pop out into a kickstand, this case would be awesome! Protects the camera and edges very well.",4
141215,Very pretty - would have liked the solar panel to have been a little higher so you could choose your height when putting them in the ground.,4
159360,The price was high but the product excellent,4
145701,Quirky fun read. Like the author.,4
149639,"As others said, it's hard to tighten it up, but possible. Plastic ring comes off easily and it's actually good because it allows you to improve this sensor easily. The thing is, that sensor inside covered in foam which insulate the heat not in a good way. So, if you'll remove the ring, you'll see a stripe of foam that should be there to push the sensor against the metal wall of the fitting. Peal and cut the piece of foam that that covers inner side of the sensor, and stick it on top of the foam on outer side right above. Clean the inner side of the sensor with alcohol and put the drop of the thermal paste on the inner side. Then put everything back. Just make sure that you placed the foam peace (that you cut) correctly, so sensor is pushed well against the metal wall. Enjoy",4
129344,Got this universal socket set for my husband he said it's pretty good quality and it does work on a lot of different projects,4
138887,"I was looking for heavy duty hampers and while I would say these are somewhat heavy duty, one hamper was not sewn up properly and I had to repair it before I could even use it. I also don't like the small hole where you put the clothes in, it is makes it harder to take thing out to put them in the washer and load from the dryer.",4
141926,Worked for my cups!!!,4
143766,"I really liked that it was all stretchy. So the fit did not have to be exact. It is a casual dress, very cute.",4
132832,Over all we really enjoyed the look of this product. I wish there was a better option for hiding the thumbs as it really takes away from the effect. I also wish they came in different sizes because for some people they were way too small. But really they look great and are pretty comfortable to wear as well.,4
140245,Screen isn't always responsive but it stays put even at highway speeds and protects the phone in all weather.,4
152229,I was looking for something that hugged and covered my ear but these hung down by the tip of it otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.,4

146851,A beautifully written inspirational story that unfortunately does not mirror real life. Keep your head lifted and your knees bent Weaver,4
141209,Brightness is what I liked most. Plastic housing does not appear to be very strong.,4
123740,Quality material and flattering style. I am 5'9 and 170lbs. A Large fits well and is slightly loose like the picture shows.,4
124453,Haven't had a chance to use it much but it seems to be a reliable product.,4
137065,The items were just as shown nice but a bit small,4
146774,I liked them a lot. But it would seem a simple thing to but a tiny button on each end of the top so the lid. This would allow one to “snap” a corresponding hole in the lid to hold it in place. It would have been better if this lid could be secured.,4
149609,"Phone is good, and camera is really good.",4
150575,Not the most plush slippers but a very nice product for the money.,4
122506,"This is a good history of the Cherokee Indian Nation from about the mid 1700's until just after the Civil War. It basically follows the Ridge family line starting with ""Major"" Ridge. This book is just not about the Trail of Tears. That is not covered until last quarter of the book. This book does give good detail of how the removal came to be and all the ones that were involved in it. It is very good on that standpoint. This should be required studies for all. It is a very bad period of our history that came at the same time the slave issue was being debated very much. It is hard to understand what people were thinking then but it was a very different time and hopefully we have progressed some in America. The reasons I only give it four stars is that much is quoted at length in this book. Much of it could have been summed up in a more concise way to make it more easily understandable. Some of it could have been left out too. Also I think more could have been devoted to the trail. The author seemed to start on good path with it but sort of broke it off suddenly. But still a very good book if you want to gain a good understanding of this terrible episode in American history.",4
137666,The pads stick well and were what I expected. Good price . I’ve used them about 5 time and stick like the first time .,4

151154,"Using this for my little indoor garden. Trying to plant in winter, so had to use one bedroom as my greenhouse. Trying this to see if it will work. Took off 1 star because I wish that the lights are bigger. Easy to install, versatile where you want to use it.",4
154619,This can give you spontaneous diarrhea and not leave enough time to find a toilet. The multi layers seem to do that.,4
126325,"No issues with the product, but they run a little small. I normally wear an 11.5 - 12. I ordered a 12, but I think a 13 would be a better fit.",4
121655,"Good feel, great quality overall, only 2 buttons feel cheap",4
143204,"This has great information for beginning affiliate marketing. The information is basic but there are some things I wasn’t aware of. It would be better if there were more examples of real people using this method. I love to hear stories of how the information is applied. Also, I think some information is a bit outdated. It’s amazing how much can change in a couple of years.",4
128782,"Got it earlier than the delivery was stated and fast. All was enclosed with packaging and instructions were included. Business card and a thank you note. I did my conversion and almost done. So, far it appears to be doing properly. I contacted seller with question about the yellow ink, but so far pleased.",4
146207,"I am very happy with the monogram, but the metal is very thin.",4
144151,I'm not able to give a wholeheartedly review because this is a gift for someone else. The earrings are pretty and attractive. They seem to be constructed well.,4
141431,I just got my new case and I already love it. The feel of the case and the look is exactly what I was hoping for :) great decision,4
120056,The belts are actually a brilliant idea. Not a 5 because the buckle is not as nice as others I've seen.,4
138926,"Works great so far. Came with windows 10, but still had the windows 7 stickers on the 2 I purchased. Yeah!",4
143461,This was going to be a spring project but I'm sick and bored so I started out. Three days in its looking pretty good. The brushes that were included are much better than I expected them to be. I actually bought brushes to use and haven't opened them. I would recommend this for sure. It's easy and incredibly relaxing.,4
129005,Clips and push pins were great but the rivets would not hold under slight pressure,4
159822,Fits grill well. A bit concerned that it may not be very durable over the long run.,4
149908,"Classic cans, found in just about every studio and radio station. Not a lot of bottom end, but a durable workhorse.",4
135269,"I bought this to pick up fresh fruits and vegetable at our co-op. It is study and holds a lot. The handles are strong, as it gets pretty heavy at times. I have used it for a variety of other tasks also. It may not be as pretty as some of the ""book party"" totes, but it is good and sturdy and works great for me.",4
157547,could be better quality material for the price,4
155929,"Great product! The Satin Frizz Control & Protection smells amazing and keeps my hair shiny, smooth, and frizz free. Would purchase again.",4

154223,Cool toys my grandson likes them,4
158195,"The colors, the mechanism, the multi use, the whole idea is perfect. It also comes with extra goodies...BUT it is WAY too low for a 20 month old baby. Please manufacturer, make it higher.",4
149521,My only beef with this is that I ordered the rose gold color and when I received it I was disappointed. The color is more bronze than rose gold....other than that it looks like a quality product and will work for what I need I think. Its exactly what I expected very thin foil.,4
125125,"I love being able to drink filtered water no matter where i am. My only problem with this bottle is that the lid leaks a bit. Not from the nozzle or around the threading, but in between two pieces of connected plastic.",4
125757,"I am so far very very happy with this case. It feels really great to hold in the hand. It looks very appealing. It does not cover any of the camera features. I know many reviews for cases say that the case interferes with the flash and I did not notice this. The case is also very very pretty and appealing! I am a little weary of the durability for major impacts, because the hard case is 2 parts. A front and a back and clicks together. I feel like when it gets dropped it'll come apart but the rubber part is pretty thick. I also like how it covers the face of the phone as I haven't bought a screen protector yet, it will definitely help protect the screen It did come with a business card saying if I register it, I get a lifetime warranty and that they will cover all shipping and replacement costs of necessary. That makes me really happy. It also came a day early so that is a plus! I will update this review if this case turns out to be not well on drops. Until then, you know I still love it!",4
121914,I got the 2mm earrings and they're perfect for everyday wear - although the 1mm would have been fine too. I gave 4/5 stars because they make my ears ITCH and HURT when it says it's sterling silver and not supposed to.,4
132438,Bought this for my mother's 08 883 Sportster works great just doesn't have a place to mount dash unit,4
135349,"I like the fact that it's very lightweight but doesn't feel flimsy. As expected for this price range, it doesn't give back the yardage as easily and quick as the Bushnell. On occasion, you have to give it a couple of tries to get the numbers. 10 seconds was the longest I've spent on retries to get the yardage. You get what you pay for. You want the yardage with slope on the first try then spend the extra $130 and get the Bushnell.",4
150871,"I was sent an 8 pack, and they don't have the black coating like pictured, so no 5 star review. I think that would keep vibrations low and protect the seats better. Anyways, they work well enough. I bent them out a little so my purse handle would fit better.",4

149630,I loved this product and have expanded my workouts thanks to these babies,4
127357,"This is a great book. Super easy once you get the hang of the short rows. As others have stated, this is write in UK terms but that's easy peasy to figure out. The one thing I WISH this book had was better instructions and some pictures for finishing the pieces and placement. I've obviously deviated from the pattern a bit and am making a unicorn instead of a zebra so figuring out where to place the facial features is a little hard and daunting.",4
141963,This book contained many cliches pertaining to black people. All in all that didn't overpower the valuable resources given out throughout the book .,4
146438,These are great shoes for a great price!! I work 60+ hours a week so comfortable shoes are a necessity to me. I wore them for the first time today and I’m impressed! My back and feet aren’t hurting at all. I only gave 4 stars since I have no idea how well they will stay together. I go through a pair of shoes every 2 months or so. I will do an update on them soon!,4
133028,I recently did my kitchen backsplash and loved how it turned out. I decided to do my kitchen countertops with this paper. My kitchen is 31 years old so it was in need of a makeover. I didn't want to spend thousands so for under $70.00 I was able to do the backsplash and counters! It's not perfect ( seams and bubbles which I tried and tried to get out) but it looks pretty darn good!,4
123657,Vary nice fit . With deep wells to hold snow or water,4

121239,Cute. It was cheap and came as expected.,4
123570,Fun and useful tool for the family. I like this brand better because it writes with less pressure needed to produce a line.,4
159016,Motion detector is too sensitive if it could be adjustable it would have been still better.,4
140619,First time trying Black seed oil and I bought this brand. It's great. I felt lighter and my less congested. I'd recommend.,4
139830,"I usually like the quality of this company's products, and the bench hamper is certainly well-made and sturdy- especially for the very affordable price- and delivery was prompt. Unfortunately, this hamper sits so low to the ground that it would be useful only to young children as a bench ( an I am, at 5'7"", not a particularly tall adult). So the hamper, like so many other items that I have purchased over the last several years, will need considerable modification before it can be used, modification that will cost time and dollars, rendering the finished and finally serviceable item neither particularly inexpensive or, despite the prompt delivery, immediately gratifying.",4
155953,My daughter bought me some bras that were too tight. These helped alot. Very easy to use and comfortable.,4
135785,Not my team but bought for a friend Nd it was not long enough on the sides,4
146218,These are super cute and actually don't bother my sensitive ears at all. I love that you can remove the lotus backing and just wear the bar studs alone for a more simple look. My only gripe is that the lotus shape is not symmetrical and that each piece is identical. I would have preferred if each piece was a mirror image of the other to create a more symmetrical look while wearing the pair. They look slightly lopsided on my small earlobes because the variation in the leaf sizes is noticeable. It would be great if both the front and back of the lotus were smooth versus the back being textured so that they were interchangeable.,4
131563,Works and fits. As described.,4
140381,Nice design and you get a good amount for what you're paying for. They're meant to last and even my husband wasn't able to open them when he tried it out so no need to worry about a child opening the cabinets. Wish it came with an actual manual but the video tutorial was just fine as well.,4
121338,Just what my swollen legs needed! Really helps relieve the swelling and ache in my legs.,4

138820,"This is my second base layer from Icebreaker so I know that it is good. However, this was a little loose, I think i should have gotten the small but my previous one was a medium. It is still comfy and will get a lot of wear out of it.",4
154053,"This mat was a definite upgrade for me but I've found it to be a little slippery for some poses during warmer yoga sessions. I'm sure there is a way to rectify this but I haven't tried anything yet. Overall, it's great and way more comfortable than my previous thinner mat. Plus, the design is great too!",4
134073,I got both colors. The black one I don't recommend as it leaves tiny black lints that can go in with the pumped milk. I didn't find the issue with the pink one.,4
126259,"A little pricey , however they work and hold up well.",4
152954,They are very comfortable and keep my hands really warm. The only downfall to them is the leather leaves little leather fragments all over your clothing etc... because they roll off of the gloves,4
125734,I got this reel for central oregon trout fishing. Taken it out on two trips and it has performed perfectly. I was able to land in two 8lb rainbows through some grass. The reel performed great.,4

131594,"Early indications are good. I had been using another leather conditioner that was highly rated on amazon but didn’t seem effective. This stuff was quickly absorbed by the leather, leaving no residue after a quick buff. Smells good. Took off a star because it seem quite pricey. I have to wonder about the packaging though - it’s very...phallic. They knew. They had to know.",4

150216,"Quality wasn’t bad for the price. A lot of the reviews suggested to size up, but I found it to run true to size. I am 5’6, 110 lbs, and a 32B. The small was slightly large, but fit overall",4
137812,It's a lovely bracelet especially for price. It's a little cheaper made than some other alternative bead bracelets on the site. Good for the price.,4

152495,"These pads are great for applying toner, removing makeup and non cosmetic uses like removing eye boogers from a cat. The rounds stay intact and so you're safe from cotton fuzz sticking to your face or manicure.",4
137427,"Works great when it works properly. I’m still using it now but we will see for how long. Just doesn’t like to sync well. But when it does, it works great.",4

123590,"They look great. The reason for just 4 stars is I haven't tried them out yet, as they are hooked up to hose bibs, but it's winter here, so I have to wait until spring to give them a go. I'll probably order another couple this spring if all goes well.",4
128523,"I love these twinkle lights. Remote on and off with timer and a variety of options for flashing, etc. my only issue is that some of the lights in this set varied in size and brightness. It was strange. I used all new batteries so i know that wasn’t the problem. I have two sets in a large garland and the varying sizes and brightness made it difficult. I had to weave one strand from one end to the other and the same with the second. Otherwise one part of the garland looked brighter than the other. Sorry, not sure that made perfect sense. Never had this issue with twinkle lights and we own quite a few sets.",4
157232,"Great dartboard! It was delivered as pictured and good quality. Ready to hang and use. We wish it had a backboard inside of the cabinet so the darts can stick when you miss the board.(..oops!) Other than that, this is great product.",4

142774,"Tried the dress on as soon as it arrived & it fit perfectly! The sequins on the front sparkle in the light, which I love! The beading on the bodice is a little cheap looking, but over all it looks very elegant, especially from a distance. I do wish it was maybe an inch longer. It just hits the floor without shoes on & I'm 5'8"". I didn't like the fact that the more I moved in the dress the more it got static cling in the lining. It didn't seem to effect the appearance of the dress on the outside though, it was just a little bothersome. The shipping was quick & arrived on time. Great price for a lovely formal dress.",4

157072,"After years of buying Hanes brand socks, I finally had to stop. Hanes socks used to be cushy and have normal-fitting ankles - not anymore, though. Now, Hanes socks are thin & flimsy with too-tight elastic around the ankles. I am petite and do *not* have 'cankles' or even thick ankles, and the new Hanes socks cut off circulation to my feet and left deep red marks on my ankles. I decided to try these No Nonsense socks and I'm so glad that I did! They're soft, just cushy enough without being thick and the elastic fits my ankles perfectly. There is no tightness, yet they're just tight enough to stay up. 100% would purchase again.",4
121544,"Purchased this for a legally blind friend in her 90's. I wish the channel and volume buttons went down and up instead of left and right. She knows down and up, but cannot remember left means down and right means up. I would rate this 5 STARS except for the directional problem she is having. It would make more sense if the buttons were vertical instead of horizontal. Hope this makes sense.",4
135047,"Beautiful material, very elegant, comfortable",4
157128,It’s looks perfect in my laundry room. Only reason I gave it a four is I had to purchase hardware at local home improvement store to hang it.,4
140339,This is really cute but it doesn't have the lining in the bottom to be labeled a swimsuit. Very cute though!,4
125176,"I’ve notice my focus, endurance, energy, clarity, strength, and presence in my body have increased while taking these pills the last few days. My mood is a little better and the more focus and presence within my body and mind help me choose the right food. I can go more miles, lift more weight, and do more reps. I haven’t checked my weight, but just how I feel after taking them the past few days I would definitely try purchasing them again.",4
148745,if you can get past the salt flavor they have a good orange flavor. helps me during hot flashes,4
147830,"Works well, nice for a small space.",4
143489,"This book is set in England, Baltimore and Canada. The story is told from the present to flashes from the past. It is hard to follow at times but I kept at it until it all made sense. Overall I recommend this book.",4
153105,"Works pretty well with my dog to inhibit pulling while walking, but does not completely deter. The plastic prong covers slip off pretty easily and I have already lost about four of them while on walks with my rottweiler. Overall pretty happy with this product.",4
152116,"I go to many customer locations over a large area. With this unit, I save them as a favorite and can always get there as fast as possible. I use my phone a lot so I don't want to use my phone. Besides, the separate GPS unit does the job more efficiently. But Garmin has made it so transferring favorites is easy with their Express but it only does a partial job. I'm having to re-enter a number of customers. Also, volume is not as loud as my model 50. Otherwise, it's just getting used to different placement of icons. And why did you change favorites to a heart?",4
129184,"This is very cute, but it’s slightly small. I have a 6 lb Chihuahua and it was super snug and almost didn’t fit. I was also a bit disappointed by the tutu. It’s not as fluffy as the picture. It is really cute though and for only a few dollars, totally worth it!",4
145593,"they work well and hold quite a bit, we like them",4
143719,That it cleans really good and I used it for my retainers.,4
132147,"I liked the characters. They were well written. Even the plot was great. However, the ending left me frustrated. An epilogue would have been most appropriate. After Crane and Maggie say they love each other, the book ends! They haven't found a place to live, when practically the entire story had them travelling to find it. . It's like reading a mystery, and the author says ""the killer has been found!"", then not saying the killer's name. Also, after several exciting events have it occurred, the author seemed to just want to end the story. Even the declaration of love was a disappointment. It just fell flat. Otherwise, I enjoyed the story.",4
121633,"They seem like good quality panties, but I had to return them because they're a bit too small for me. I cant really say they're smaller than they should be for their size, because in my experience, each brands' sizes are different.",4
136438,"Slightly larger than I thought but love it, nonetheless. The quality is great, I love how spacious the inside is. I do wish the inside pocket was a bit more functional maybe the pocket needs some structure.",4
144733,Love this light. Have several as we do a lot on night riding and it can be seen from very far away. Would give it five stars if they included a smaller band (or actually a variety of sizes) to fit around different diameters more tightly.,4
147343,The comparisons drawn between the times of Ahab and Jezebel and Bill and Hillary Clinton were intriguing. The author's closing comments were right on. Can't really say there was anything I really didn't like.,4
126430,"I purchased this item. I really doubt that it is RFID blocking though, since it looks like most other pouch type holders. But just to be safe on that, I went ahead and purchased the RFID blocking sleeves to put our passports into. This item holds a good deal, although its not super big. Rather thinly made too.",4
154449,"OK price, but not really equivalent in construction to the stock filter. Seems to work OK regardless.",4
138065,"Comfortable, fit well. Launder and dry with no odor. Fun and yet virtually no show once shoes are on!",4
150862,"Thin material. We bought Knuckles, too, and Knuckles is MUCH better. Quality is not great for Sonic.",4
134812,"I am a real sketchers fan, I have a number of pairs and I like each and every one. The ""wide-fit"" are my favorite. This pair are very comfortable, once you get them on your feet, The are slip-ons with elastic in the laces that gives you a little give on the top of your foot. I hope they will loosen up a little once I have worn them for a while. I would recommend Sketchers to a friend.",4
154197,"This was a gift, but I know these replacement parts are much appreciated when we didn’t need the whole NutriBullet set.",4
132469,"Perfect for fixing shirts and/or pants. Haven’t used it yet, but I’m doubting the quality of the string, looks kind of flimsy. Other than that, it brings all the tools you need to fix those shirt buttons.",4
147815,I’m comfortable with the Burt’s Bees brand. I’m a little disappointed in it tho. Does not seem to clean that well,4
129793,They are small but will work just fine in a pinch. The color cover comes off to easy on some. But all locks have different keys.,4
129796,"It is pretty good. Original I had small size as recommended by my doctor. Even though I am only 4'10"" it was a little to small. Ordered adult and that worked. Absolutely better than bulky form sling.",4
138101,I think most shoes like these are a little tight but I got these for my step daughter to use for her theater classes and she said they were tight but did the job.,4
152837,"I like them , they were extremely soft",4
132785,"Fair price, appears to be a solid product, my daughter loves it.",4
139881,I bought it for my 30yr old daughter. Just because. It's adorable we both love it. Can't dunk cookies in it though. The panda doesn't like getting hit in the head by them,4
149217,"Very nice, soft, comfortable pliable lashes, yes they are a bit long for my taste, but a little trim easily customize them to your preferred length. The one thing for the lost of a star is the eyeliner..not waterproof at all it just takes a little bit of moisture, the liner comes off, I can remove it with a lightly damp water base wipe. If you purchase the lashes, just keep in mind the additional cost of a real waterproof magnetic liner.",4
144824,Not bad for the price.,4
153461,Lots of useful information and examples for writing. I just wish it was a little longer.,4
147401,This works great and helps with my posture while on my office chair. The back of my chair is not that wide so luckily I'm able to strap the Mesh Lumbar Cushion around it and it holds in place. It's comfortable and helps my lower back a lot.,4
147392,if you need just nice natural look this is best,4
139573,Pretty good little knives! The lids do not stay on well and you have to remove the lids to figure out which one you’re looking for but sharp and effective!,4
151070,"Brighter and whiter than the stock bulbs for sure, and have a little better range and side beam also. Somewhat expensive but I'd buy again. Depends on how long they last.",4
137944,Does not fit large folding chairs. I have an auxiliary use for the bag so I am not taking a loss on the purchase.,4
153761,"As someone with OCD, it drives me insane that the stickers don't come off cleanly.",4
134680,"Became my most wore pair of shoes very quick. Maybe I do too much, but I wish they were a lil tougher because I ran through my pair prett quick. But I definitely love these! Well worth the buy.",4
129560,"It works, and I definitely needed it. It just has to be perfectly aimed at the sound bar.",4
145478,"I used this product to get a dark blue (from jeans) stain out of a light blue and white striped dress shirt. The stain didn't come completely out but to be fair, I probably didn't leave the shirt in long enough. One note of caution: I dissolved the dye remover in hot water & then added the shirt. The shirt TURNED COMPLETELY PINK! I freaked out and assumed the shirt was ruined. HOWEVER, once I rinsed the shirt out, it turned back to the original blue and white stripe. So it was some kind of temporary chemical reaction. If I had known I would have left the shirt in the dye remover & hot water longer and maybe the stain would have come completely out. I didn't notice anyone else with this issue so just be aware!",4
154658,"Is bigger than I thought, quality of image is great.",4
126311,"My husband loves to relax in the bath after a long day and I’m constantly looking for things to make his experience in there better. This was the perfect gift for him! The pillow is super comfy and definitely more pleasant than the edge of the bathtub digging into your shoulders. It does slip around a bit, but is easily solved by just readjusting. I love how well it dries out after use and hanging up to dry. I was a little worried that it would be a mold magnet, but so far it hasn’t been an issue. The drain cover was also a big hit for my husband. He was constantly complaining that he couldn’t fill his bath enough without it draining, so he loves this and it works like a charm!",4
153507,"Very cute T shirt but run small , I normally wear large but since others review said size up so I ordered XL still little too fit for my liking . Two size up if you like loose fit like me !",4
140476,"Works well, wish it were brushless for a little more power. Does bog down once hot, but lets face it, this is a cheap tool.",4
152604,Easy to use and makes eating fresh pineapple more pleasurable.,4
156373,so far so good very cute.,4
125209,"Bought these for my husband's work shoes and they are awesome. Ordered more for my son's shoes, that's how good they work. No more smelly shoes!",4
159519,For a first book by an unknown this was very well done. The characters can be felt by the reader. The world is complex enough to be interesting but not over explained. It ends with a HFN. There are gaps in the characters back story that make you want the next book but not enough to be a cliffhanger. Sold work! Please give us more.,4
129671,I love the Gi itself. Great feel and fit. The color is exactly perfect. The only complaint I have is that it does not come with a belt for your top so I had to buy one.,4
138249,They are good all purpose scissors. Good for heavy duty duty as well as light duty.,4
133578,Great quality. Size perfect. Delivered timely,4
151374,"Good product, coating doesn’t fade or peel. Forks are big but not too big, spoons and knifes average size. Our set had 11 spoons and 13 forks, oops!",4
141752,"I totally got the wrong size, I ordered a large because I figured it would shrink in the wash, other than that I like it.",4
124889,"This is an update, before I said it was a good product. It’s not the same thing happened to the replacement that happened to the first one. There is something wrong with the Bluetooth transmitters in these products. But the customer relation is great even though they won’t admit that something is wrong with their product. Update: I emailed the company and they emailed me back. The person I talked to is a really caring person. The customer relation part of this company is awesome. I would definitely buy from this company again. Just because I trust the people who represent the company.",4
139752,This book and learning about Chakras was totally fascinating for me. It is like taking yoga to a totally different level. It is simple and direct with only a few pages to detail the Chakras framework. I have benefited greatly from organizing perception and self-awareness based upon these centers of power. I highly recommend this book especially to those who are beginners like me.,4
148481,"Product is very good. However, the observation I have is that it came wrapped with a lot plastic. We are suppose to be buying this in order to save on plastic. Everything came with excessive packaging. Seller should review this.",4
120965,"I had a cheap case and when my phone hit the street the case exploded, my phone went flying, and landed facedown. She hit and bounce very hard and the screen was shattered in some areas but my phone screen was untouched!",4
120325,the only thing was that the box had a whole in it but the puzzle inside was in a plastic bag with no damage.,4
141883,Very good feeling and light.,4
125172,"Great for what I needed it for, lasted me a long time! Only thing is I had to safety pin it to fit me because I guess I'm too skinny, I'm 5'7"" and 120lbs 🤷",4
153110,Comfort on the ball of my foot.,4
126076,Hope it works as good as it looks,4
124946,"Great game! But I wish it came in a game box, the game is in a plastic bag in a shipping box but there is no actual game box. The game did work well and we had fun playing.",4
145532,This is a great Sous Vide cooker with accessories for the price. Works great.,4
156012,Good quality picture,4
137018,"When I opened the shipping box, the two packs of paper and a box of Cortisone I ordered were all open. The paper is fine, but I'm not sure if I should use the Cortisone because it could have been tampered with. I've never had this happen before.",4
151320,"It's both fast and slow. If you're an avid drama movie fan, this is a no-brainer. The framing is incredible. The plot heart-wrenching.",4
149552,"Does the job, but be careful, it is very sharp!! Love that it can be hooked onto keys!!",4
158412,Great product. I use them all the time on my quads and forearms,4
139597,"Not very sturdy material. A heavy pie would have to go on the bottom, but it gets the job done.",4
123795,This is a lovely nightgown and the 4 stars in only due to the cotton quality. It is “good” however cold be softer it is was higher quality. The cotton is certainly sufficient just not the best quality ...and that being said I wear it regularly and am pleased overall.,4
128717,"These boots are fantastic! I have been debating for awhile whether or not to spend the money on them as I believe they are pricey for rubber boots, even though they are Hunters. I can say, after wearing once in the rain, I reach for them continually. They look great but are also so functional and perfect for rainy/chilly fall Ohio weather. I wore them with both one and two pair of socks depending on temperature, but on very rainy days. My feet were warm and dry. The fit was as expected, the calves are not tight, as others have mentioned, but I was also not swimming in them. I don't think I would purchase the Hunter fleece socks as I believe the fit would be tight with them on. There is an adjustable buckle on the side for a bit more room if needed. I am a realtor so I'm out in the elements for work. I will get a lot of use making the cost per wear very reasonable! My only complaint from this seller is the box looked like it literally fell off a truck! It was held together w rubber bands and apparently had been crushed.",4
130220,"It keeps coming off the lanyard. Other than that, it's fine.",4
129242,The colors on the backpack are a not so great. It’s ok I guess,4
157142,"This scarf is very soft, but not what I was expecting. But I’m keeping it. I will give away as gift.",4
127368,Assembly isn’t as easy as you would think. The screws don’t really screw into place very well and it comes packaged with white tape around it but doesn’t specify anywhere whether or not you should remove the tape... The price can’t be beat! The branches are very bendable and can hold weight. I wanted an unconventional and simplistic Christmas tree this year so I used it for that. I would say that it is truly 6 ft but the lights are not a “warm white” more of a “cool white”. All in all I’m satisfied. And best part is that you can use this tree indoors or outdoors all year round!,4
124174,Good for the cost. And for the first trial run. Not expecting much for the :$$ but I'm happy with it besides it could have better adhesion but I fixed that with 3m double sided tape,4
139990,I only wish it had a Hint button! Good game for staying alert!,4
123958,"Great size, larger than I expected so this was a great deal. Sturdy material, not flimsy that I can tell. It did come damaged a bit but it’s a trash can so whatever. Would buy again if I needed more trash cans this size.",4
124147,This banner was adorable!,4
148544,"I intend to buy a second one of these composters. The lid easily ""locks"" and it made it through a hurricane when the plastic box around our generator had its lid and a door blow off. The only thing I wish it had was bigger openings in the top to get watered by the rain. I have composted for years, but I now live in a different climate, so I can't really compare it to my many previous composters.",4
142449,Interesting story of unexpected friendships and years of staying in touch. I wasn't sure where the story line was going after the first segment but was surprised by the way of the story.,4
132753,It was exactly what I had ordered and I want to thank you guys for delivering it a little early,4
132904,these lights are slim and well made. I hope they last long as promised.,4
134488,The seeds were packaged properly and arrived on time. The best commentary can only be given based on germination rates and the quality of the beets.,4
155360,Mouth cover freezes up after a while but it's comfortable and warm.,4
124670,"Pretty good product for the price. The tools are great for adjusting the band, should work with other bands as well. The replacement pins did rust a bit, but that’s not a big deal to me.",4
141125,Jacket is a little bit loose for BTS doll...but quality is so good~!,4
123290,"I finally found an eyeliner that goes smooth and stays on the waterline! I have been looking a long time! Very nice, easy to use. The only problem, and it's not small, is that this product does not last long. What you see is what you get. Once the tip you see is down 2/3 of the way, it is unusable and you have to order another- and throw out the plastic (I am trying to decrease plastic waste so that's not good). I have had kohl pencils I bought in Istanbul that lasted for years. This is the same quality. I just wish there was more of it in the pencil.",4
129210,Appear to be fine. Reasonably comfortable.,4
152643,"I knew this was story that the movie ""Panic in the Year Zero"" was based on but it goes much deeper. It's two short stories on the plot and it went down a path that caught me off guard. If your someone looking forward to doomsday give this a read. If your like me and enjoy survival fiction its still a must read. Mr. Moore has written two stories with a twist, well worth the time to read.",4
123581,"I really liked this vest for my dog! It fits well, light weight and breathable. I got a medium size and it was a little tight but it fit well. I would recommend that if you purchase, go 1 size bigger.",4
132942,i had some small scratches on my car for a while and they were keep bugging me but i didnt want to paint it because a partial paint is visible even with identical color and doing a full job was just crazy so i decided to give a try to this paint scratch cloth and surprisingly it did a very good job. now i`m the only one who knows where the scratches were,4
155014,Easy to set up with Century Link. A rep from Actiontec even came into the call to answer additional questions. Works great!,4
126517,"Love these shoes! Extremely comfortable and nice looking, although they did run slightly large.",4
146437,"These will likely last me for all of the vacations in my life; however, I was a little disappointed to learn that they're sold locally in my Canadian province for a fraction of the price on Amazon.com. Americans might find a better deal locally as well (?)",4
141727,"VERY DIFFICULT TO READ AS AN E-BOOK. Be warned -- I wish I'd bought the hard copy. The book is fascinating and wide-ranging, but the author always uses Arabic terms, which makes sense since many (most? all?) of them have no direct parallel in English. But there is no glossary, so if you don't happen to remember what an Arabic word refers to, many pages after its first appearance, you're stuck. The only alternative that I can think of is trying the Index -- but on Kindle that means making a note of where you are in the text, then going to the Index to find the term, and going back into the text to try to find the appearance of the term when it's first described. But since the Index of course refers to specific pages in the hard copy version, this will be only a vague indication for an e-reader. I can only wish that the author and publisher had included a glossary in the Kindle version. At this point (I'm about halfway through) I'm not really prepared to go back to the very beginning to compile my own glossary. So it's all very frustrating, particularly since the book itself is so interesting.",4
150436,"Very helpful book, goes with his other books. Good reference.",4
120686,Just gave this to my year old for Christmas. She loves it. My complaint is that the cutting board does not make any chopping noises like it says it's supposed to,4
123213,I have keratosis pilaris and also other tiny zits all over my body and it seemed to help with this. Not completely eliminating them but it helped. It's kind of an odd soap though because it is like a tarry substance that has to be cut up or smeared onto the shower rag. It didn't cause me any allergic reaction though which is very good. Overall I am satisfied with it and would recommend it to others.,4
152922,"Seems to be decent quality and certainly not bad for the price. I wouldn't attempt anything too heavy-duty but in the pinch this will get the job done. I doubt it's a great choice for a working professional, but good enough for a homeowner needing to make occasional cuts. Makes nice straight even cuts with the supplied blade.",4
133261,At this price point this is a very good deal . Finish is well completed . No rough spots . Smooth action . Quality materials . No opinion yet on edge retention ( havent had it long enough) . I'm impressed. You get (imo) more than you pay for .,4
127280,Great but in a holder the bottom can get soggy.,4
157860,"Works OK, not much power on Battery, Doesn't shave as close as my old one",4
142951,The dial is really really hard to read. Seemed like I received used items. Water in the chamber. Soleplate scratched.,4
139766,It is a good solid case that does a good job of protecting the unit. The only minus is that does not support the unit in the vertical position for those times when horizontal doesn't work.,4

155704,"It's really great, but some of them are easily breakable, especially by teething puppies.",4
131004,I wouldn’t go as far as to say this helps with weight loss or metabolism but it definitely helps with stress. I did find that my stress level felt reduced and I handled things in a more calm way lol,4
153199,Worth the money. Cheaper than buying it at a store. A little flimsy but it gets the job done,4
138756,"Cute design, but the proportions are weird. I should have ordered 2 sizes up to accommodate legroom and torso. However, the arms are way too long! Overall, still good; not scratchy or anything.",4
155054,"There are pros and cons to this product. Pros: it works well; I can see my kids while they sleep; the monitor let's me know when it needs to charge; I like that there is a music button, with the VOX setting, the screen turns off when kids are quiet which preserves battery life; it gives us the option to mount to the wall with 2 holes on the back; it does not connect to WiFi which prevents hackers, so keeps my kids safe; it has volume controls and I can talk to my kids through the monitor which is great when I see them doing something they should not; the monitor for my kids room can twist different ways which is great when mounting. Cons: the screen is small; picture quality is not so great; because of the piece that stands the parent up and the charging cable, it can be awkward to stand up; the volume is not very loud; even though it's given the option to mount, no screws come with it to mount; the speaker control is not great and sometimes my kids can't hear me through it; it only sometimes beeps when the kids monitor gets unplugged. I've given it a 4 because for the most part it does it's job and it's good for what I need it for and that is to be a second monitor to the one of a different brand that I already have. It's not as good as my other one, but it works.",4
158554,Great to restrict my ten pounds. It is very difficult to open the corner. I cut off the plastic pin on the top and it pops in and out with ease. A bungee cords holds the top together.,4
128490,"These are great, a little small and some of the shapes are intricate, so they are a little fragile. My 5 year old loves it when I do this with deli ham and cheese. Even my 9 yr old and 11 year old think this is fun. Because the shapes are delicate I don't use this as much as some of my other small cutters. I would recommend this product.",4
147720,Overall pretty good stopped headlights from flickering but didn't help with radio interference,4
149840,A bit difficult to plug into my Motorola phone but works great otherwise.,4
130832,Great Price. Great Quality!,4
127820,needed and shipped quick,4
152701,Great quality product but it feels a bit slippery on the borders (at least to my touch). Still a great minimalist protection for your iPhone 11 Pro Max if you handle your phone with care. It looks great on the phone too...,4
102617,Thinner than expected.... sheen to it rather than matte... difficult to get it to lay flat,3

101664,Loved the pendant. Ended up buying a real gold chain for it. So far hasn’t changed. I try to minimize wearing it.,3
109423,They fit fine on my son and feel of good quality. Unfortunately they are not as advertised. These are only 60% merino and not 80% (see photo).,3

92595,Insert falls off of rings easily. Do not last. Look cool but don't last long enough to wear.,3
108996,I liked how it started the story right away. Really liked the book . My problem was Rebecca went from talking like a Scottish lass to sounding more American. A few other minor details . I read alot and catch any small details that some readers miss. Stallion to a mare when did he get another horse. Little details like that . Those can throw a good story off .,3

87331,"While these are really comfy and lightweight, they are OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD. They squeak with every step and since I’ve already worn them a few times hoping the problem would go away, I can’t send them back. Wouldn’t recommend for noise factor, in spite of them being comfortable.",3
82930,I love this i have 3 big dogs that love to sleep on my couches the only bad about these is they slip off even when they are connected to the stretchy holder that goes behind the couch,3

98730,I love vita coco and just coconut water in general but my package was damaged and one of my bottles was empty ! The box was open and one of the bottles was bust open,3
101282,Bottle is okay but it doesn't keep things cold for that long. Maybe 1.5hrs at most. Also the top doesn't seal very well.,3
96509,They stretch pretty badly. Do not hold as well as the original brand.,3
98875,Prequel to Dory's story. There's not much mention of her dad until the end. Lots of chasing and running with some fight scenes between people and reptiles. Okay.,3

97509,"I wanted to love this, but I just don’t. The whale is cute and we still use that, but the submarine and sprayer part is a little much for my 14 month old. Maybe when she’s a bit older we’ll bring it back out and try again, but for now it was kind of a dud. At least she can play with the whale!",3

118420,"2nd purchase hope clip system on this model is better, 2 months so far so good",3
98597,This product is just okay. It worked as a primer but felt like I was putting straight up Vaseline on my face. I didn't break out at all but I'm not sold on the texture. The only reason I tried this product is because of wanting a cheaper product than my go to face primer but the extra money is definitely worth it for something more high quality. Will probably not be buying this product again.,3
87441,"I bought two units and overall love the mobile music. Both units were processed the exact same. While listening to them, my second unit's battery only lasted about 20 hours.

102449,"Would be much better if it were a wedge with a full taper to the bottom. There's too much material at the bottom where the thighs sit and it's uncomfortable for more than a five minute drive, at least for me. I feel like it would cut off circulation on a longer trip. Did reduce my sciatica and back pain, though, so I'm just going to seek out a different model.",3

98560,Received incorrect sprinkler head. Package labeled correctly.,3

119764,"I would like to suggest that they need to aware that the way the product was shipped. It arrived timely when box was open the earbuds were out of it's own box it was ship with one bubble wrap. Since the earbuds were not in it's own box. I was surprised it worked. The sound quality is great. There is no way of making the sound go down lower. I turn my volume on my phone, but the sound is still too loud. Also, you have to wear both headset.

96397,No big chucks of Rice Crispies like when bought in the store... a little disappointing :/,3

105658,"This is not what I was expecting. Because of the ridiculously cheap price, I won't complain much. Just be aware that if you are looking for a classic, delicate and sophisticated looking chain, then this is not the right item.",3
95631,"Doing the initial sealing (bottom seal) of the bags works fine in my Foodsaver. But with the Vacuum & Seal function, the seal does not hold vacuum and the bag comes open. Has done this every time I sealed a bag, regardless of size or contents. Here's a hack if that happens to you. Immediately after the Vacuum & Seal process is done, hit the Seal button to give it an extra heat seal. Then open the machine and the bag should be sealed and airtight. I'll probably spend the extra $$ next time and get the OEM Foodsaver bags. Until then, these will do in a pinch.",3

114542,Cute product but not very durable. One of the rings broke when hanging them.,3

92732,"While I like these shelving units (enough to buy 3 of them), and love how easy they are to assemble (takes about 5 minutes), I have to say that the plastic is not as sturdy as I had hoped and expected. The plastic is fairly thin and without any metal rod supports underneath, and not even much plastic support on the bottom side either. I would not even think about putting even half the weight the each shelf supposedly supports unless you want the shelves to bend/curve towards the center. Still, if you put lighter things on the shelves it is decent and helped me organize our tiny detached garage better (and lay a long Thule cargo box on top as well).",3

91529,Certainly not for everyone. They are quite potent and they have a bit of a burnt taste to them but if you like what licorice is actually supposed to taste like this is for you. They might not be over priced but they are too expensive for what you get and the big picture of the tiny box is a bit misleading.,3
113858,I normally don’t write reviews but I wanted to give a heads up to anyone installing this backboard of my thoughts. I mounted the backboard on the universal mount on my garage wall above our garage. The products came well packaged and all hardware was there. Give yourself a good 4-5 hours to install the backboard and lots of workspace. I am fairly handy but this was a larger job than I expected. Read the directions carefully as I agree with other reviews the directions are not very good. The pieces are not well marked to match the directions and you need to line up the parts visually and very carefully. I had to take apart and put back together the rim when the springs did not fit the first time. Unless you have a 10 foot ladder to balance the weight of the board when you bolt the backboard to the mount and the strength to lift the backboard by yourself you will need an adult helper. Don’t get into this project and realize you need help. When finished the hoop looks good and I suspect I will forget the difficult installation so it gets 3 stars from me but plan ahead when you do your install.,3
110339,Can barely see the names on it.,3
81059,"Disappointed with the color. Picture is aqua, but it’s blue. Nice mat tho!",3
95314,I live in Atlanta and have really curly hair. I was hoping to find something new to help with the frizz and dryness. This actually has made my hair drier and will not help with frizz once summer sets in. It may be good for straight hair or mine in the winter.,3
80084,"Very cool color, but I wish it was packaged with more care. The bottle was busted, so it was covered in green dye staining my hands.",3

119220,"We've purchased five of these so far among my household, and of the first four, one has had major issues making it unusable. The problem stems from the front wheel bearings, on the first day of use after assembly the front left wheel bearing came apart in the sleeve. I noticed a wobble when peddling and had originally thought the front wheel had somehow been bent, and upon further inspection taking the wheel off I found the culprit, a blown apart wheel bearing. This won't ruin our time as we will be able to make do, but is a huge disappointment since the other three trikes are still running strong. However, don't let one bad experience of four fool you, these are still decent trikes and well worth the money for the enjoyment we've gotten out of them, we will just be one short is all.",3
92390,"Ok read... fun little book, and easy to read. Not sure I can give it more than 3 stars simply because those attracted to its message will have come to it for a purpose of sorts. It is pleasant and even teases to spark the imagination, but I would need something... else. It points, ha, to something but leaves us in the end wanting more.",3
101668,I should have gotten different size. These ok,3
92087,Hurts your ears after wearing for more than 2 hours.,3
86037,They are ok they don't stay in place well,3
99018,Fits as expected and seems like a decent quality and well made. However the item had a funny kind of smell to it and needed to be washed right away. No issues after being laundered.,3
111162,Works great but very small tank so have a refill close by and fill before every outing.,3
106222,Fits good! Looks good for a cheap costume!,3

112258,"The size for the band was big enough, but it was too wide and the elastic bothered my corgi. Also, the absorbent area of the band bunched beneath my dog’s body and didn’t really absorb. When I removed the belly band, pee had pooled without much absorbing, and it spilled. Although I thought these sturdy, thick bands were meant to be more absorbent, they were not a good fit for my dog. I will try with incontinence pad and hope they’ll work, although he likes no-elastic bands much better.",3

I found out to my dismay that it won’t function properly unless there is significant amount of very bright sunlight outside. We have had only a couple sunny days since we installed this film, and it did work great then, but for the rest of the time it was awful. On partly cloudy days, the film becomes reflective from the inside. When we turn the lights on inside, we are overwhelmed by the visual chaos because we see all the reflections of everything inside the room superimposed on the shadowy images on the outside. It’s really disappointing. I’m looking forward to the few months of the year when we get enough intense sunlight so I can open the curtains and enjoy the beautiful view outside my window.",3

83012,I just got the another battery. Hopefully it works.,3
104938,"A little bit bigger than I'd like. They're incredibly soft, which is good for sensitive skin. However, the softness makes it somewhat ineffective for removing makeup. I didn't see much coming off on the pad and when I wiped with a disposable cotton pad with a rougher surface, a lot of makeup came off. The surface is very soft, sort of like a stuffed animal or fuzzy blanket. It feels nice on skin but absorbs a lot of toner. This was my first reusable cosmetic pad so they work for now, but I think I will try another brand eventually and use these for something else.",3
92727,Do not like the wobbly pole,3

115525,"Yes, it's smaller than it appears. I bought this one at 13"" and a different style 15"" across, for two guest baths that were mirror images of each other. Amazing the difference that 2"" makes. The 15"" looks large & elegant in all stainless. This one looks small and cheap, with a stainless face and BLACK wire spokes. I would have returned it, except by the time the bathrooms were remodeled and I could install, the return window had passed. I've moved it to a little-used bedroom with dark walls, where the black spokes fade into the wall color and the clear jewels sparkle and appear to float against the background. It keeps time well enough.",3
92635,Guess I was expecting too much,3
119651,I used to use this product years ago and it would easily remove all oil stains. It seems the formula has changed. Likely due to environmental enforcement. I respect that but this is not the product I knew and loved. Used to but it at Costco,3
84004,OK but nothing particularly helpful.,3
86923,Didn't say anywhere on the Amazon page that this item has to be refrigerated! And it's a huge box. Relatives thought this was the white elephant of the season.,3

Then put all 5 in a big cup full of filtered water that had already sat for 1 day. 4 out of 5 seeds fell to the bottom but all 5 sprouted. When sprouts were about 6 in. I put them in a shallow basket with clay-ish soil. Then layered with pebble stone and put in 1st shelf of pond. There seem to be about 13 pads. Still no flowers but we shall see?",3
103892,"Had these for about a week now, comfortable and polarized looks great, but they chipped/peeled from dusting and cleaning them. Haven’t dropped or scratched them so it isn’t caused by that. Would be a great pair of glasses if they didn’t peel so soon/at all.",3
87147,I like that this is a soft material and that the materials reinforce different natural resources for building. However I wish the pieces would stack or hold together better because building is really not possible. It’s more lying pieces on top of each other to build very small sculptures. Would like if these linked or secured into place somehow. Not what I was expecting.,3
102265,The black in the engraving is wearing out.,3
103587,Was able to add the chrome ring to the headrest but the Jaguar emblem for the button does not stick. The chrome ring still adds a nice touch though.,3
80616,Received totally different color.,3
96720,I ordered two sets of these clippers which arrived today. Quality control is not quite what I expect for the cost. One set was exactly as expected. But the second pair had both of the files built into the handles loose and they fell off right when taken out of the package for the first time. It appears that the file was not pressed into the glue like it should have been. See attached pictures. I should not have to repair something I just purchased right after taking it out of the package. If not for the inconsistency in quality I would have given them five stars.,3
112993,It’s cute and the colors are nice. It’s also big enough to contain the mess. But it’s bit flimsy and needs to be thicker.,3
112193,It worked fine...while it lasted. I only owned it a few months and the screws from the bottom came loose as did the wiring. A good deal but probably a waste of money in the long run.,3
82353,"OK, but quite weak in details and illustrations. The benchmark continues to be ""Little Kids first big book of Space"" from National Geographic, which my daughter loves.",3
111721,Not as good as the first. They went way off the deep end with this one,3
80405,This looks nice and is something I could make myself in 2 hours if I wasn’t feeling lazy. I think the feet should have a bit of rubber to keep it from sliding on smooth surface flooring if you don’t have the perfect angle against the wall.,3

88057,"I really hoped this would calm my eczema, but it made it much, much worse. My skin started itching as soon as I put it on, but I continued using it to see if my skin just needed time to adjust. After a few days my eczema was totally out of control. Stopped using it and it has mostly calmed back down to its pre-ampoule state. On the parts of my face that aren’t eczema-prone, this stuff made my skin feel really soft and smooth. It’s a shame that I can’t use it, as seems like it would be a nice product for less sensitive skin.",3
108952,"At $5 or even $10 dollars this would be a fine product the design is good. Cons: -it’s really expensive and over priced for what is does long term. -seems this is designed to wear out -no opposing Velcro strip on the brace so the cloth wears out after a few weeks of use and Velcro strap stops holding Pros: -great design, soft and comfortable -pulls at the ball of foot not the toes -small and easy to store",3
85113,"It is that very soft terrible material. It is cute but runs a bit small, i would go up a size cause it will shrink when you wash it. The color is very pretty. Comes with dental floss thong.",3

91593,Liked product but not a lot of product,3
108383,Very comfortable material but the top gathers up. It needs something to keep in place under the breast.,3
85650,Fits well and easily installed.,3

105549,Some of the pieces were not cut smoothly and did not match up with the other,3
113803,"The fabric and construction wasn't as expected. I typically order a small in work out gear because I like a good fit while being active. This set didn't have as good of a stretch and didn't snap back like others do. You can see the stitching at the seems a little as well. Overall, it's ok didn't rip. It just wasn't what I was expecting as I've ordered other sets that I love! The seamless sets are my favorite. I gave this set to my daughter as she's a little smaller than I am.",3

97695,good product to wear under dresses. After wearing 4 times it broke. Really desapointed.,3
81863,"I enjoy movies from this time period, mainly cause I love seeing the antique furniture , buildings, etc. And I love George Sanders and his brother...Tom Conway. This set has some good story lines, and the pictures are clear and sound very good. My only complaint is the way they kept using the same actors and actresses all throughout these movies. Acting is very good though...but the sameness gets redundant and a bit boring. Some of the same lines are used, throughout the movies. I was born shortly after these movies were filmed, and I recall much of what appears in them...the building styles, furniture styles to some extent, and some of the clothing styles were still popular in the 1950's. ..I was a very young girl but I recall a lot of this. Brings back memories. Was a simpler life back then...slower, more easy going. People were nicer to one another and more polite. I miss that.",3
95958,"They are okay , but have the odor of vanilla icing ( sweet , sugary) versus French vanilla.",3
113602,Says that it is good to use in the US but they are universal discs and do not work on any of our devices.,3
104616,These seem of good quality to last and firm support but the placement of the arch is a bit off for my feet (too close to the heel) so it hurts when I walk more than a few blocks. I'm a 10.5 US. The arch placement might be better for smaller feet but I expect it would be worse for larger because you trim the front end to fit your shoe but the arch stays the same distance from the back.,3
97606,"My cat does like them, so I gave it 3 stars, but the whole purpose was to help clean her teeth, and they are just too tiny to do anything for her teeth. She had bad breath and these did absolutely nothing, no surprise because she essentially swallows them whole. Instead, I put a couple drops of Apple Cider Vinegar into her water every day. Within a week her breath problem was solved. I won't be buying these again because they're simply ineffective.",3
99269,I bought this to remove weeds in hard southwest desert soil. Very difficult (and sometimes painful) because the top of the blade is too narrow to use your foot/leg to help drive it into the soil. Probably would work well in soft loamy soil.,3
100361,It is easy to over toast the bread.,3
106081,sent it back color isnt that bright as displayed on photo,3
93511,"I bought these for a friend after he raved about their quality. We didn't receive one of each color, but rather two oranges, one green, and one purple - no blue. They also looked a little banged up and dirty, and my friend discovered that they were not solid plastic but rather a colored sticker wrap. He peeled one right off to reveal a plain black lighter underneath. Disappointing (even though the solid black does look nice), considering he remembered having one in the past that was solid colored plastic and not just a sticker. We either received a knockoff, or the bottom of the barrel from the warehouse! Luckily, they all work and feel nice in the hand.",3
97517,"Nooooo where near the 350 lumens in the description, but for the price a handy little light for glove box, tool box or purse.",3
80486,This is my first review of over 100 items purchased. Seal was broken and product appeared to be old. I've used it for months and it works fine.,3
85539,"Colors are beautiful, but it's hard to turn when you want to use it",3
81214,This book is the same as the only other book I have read from this author....the makings of a really great book with interesting characters who get shafted in the telling of the story. It could have been so good. Instead its just meh.,3
113180,"It gets stuff clean! The nozzle, however, drips when left with the nozzle facing down. Not ideal if you want to place on a shelf and use without picking up every time.",3
107734,Very difficult to assemble,3
83280,Not as strong of a magnet. My kid can pull it off quite easily from her locker.,3
105873,Power button not open enough in case.,3
89219,My grandson likes it.,3
113750,One bottle was broken,3
95221,These items break very easily,3
103150,I like the plush feeling of the purse. The colours are vibrant which makes me happy. Lol It has many slots to hold my cards and it also holds my Samsung J7 Pro so that's a plus.,3
84936,The bottle was 1/4 way gone. It did not appear to be a new bottle.,3
117075,"Too many frosted colours for me to be truly useful. The shade selection is very pretty, very basic neutrals. If only they were matte, I would give them 5 stars. They don't have the staying power you might want, but the price is great. I received 2 boxes for the price.",3
106698,"I love the product and have used it for a while now however when I bought it on amazon for the first time the bottle I got had spilled everywhere, out of th bottle and in the package.",3
116390,"Well first, one died after a few weeks. Thought maybe it was the battery, but nope. New batteries, no change. Besides that, it's now July and I've only changed the battery one since October. AA Batteries not included Second it's not actually motion activated as indicated in comparison chart. But it's fine for it's purpose: detects lack of light for activation (attached under bathroom cabinets about 2in off ground). Actually the reason why I bought it. It's AMBER light doesn't blind me at night while in the bathroom. Lastly, the included stickies. Doesn't actually tell you which one is applied to the product and which one is used to mount onto the wall.",3
116544,make sure you stretch your strings before you freak out about how it wont hold a tune,3
92645,works 50% of the time on the 1st try. must keep at it to accomplish the job.,3
107837,Second time I removed from trailer ball it tore. Was able to duck tape over it but it doesn't look as good now. Advise to keep ball well greased and be patient/slow when removing cover.,3
108679,"Bought because my finger print sensor went out. New one, still doesn't work. On/off button must be pressed extra hard also.",3
80519,I did like it this was second one I bought. Had it 3 months used twice stopped charging . Cant get it to charge at all it's dead. Not happy,3
99149,"They are definitely useable, but I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone or ever rebuy. You have to scrub your nose dry to have it stay (which was expected) but then it wouldn’t fit anywhere properly on my nose.",3
91733,It is as the picture shows except has basically permanent square wrinkles from how it was folded for shipping. The flower wreath to go around the number on the sheet is cute but not of great quality. The pink headband is cute. I would give it 4 stars if the sheet wasn’t so wrinkled and 5 if the wreath was better quality.,3
81427,"Lock works intermittently, have to move lock handle on the inside of door slightly to use keypad to lock door otherwise it does not engage throw mechanism.",3
83572,"I thought that the seat was going to be comfortable, I find it to be hard.",3
108361,"Bought these for my husband for his Birthday. He was so happy that he received so many light with this offer. One thing, he did need to rewire them, they were very thin and brittle and he put different brackets on them also. It was very easy for him, some individuals may not be able to do that. For the price, he would buy again if he needed more.",3
90796,I didn't really notice any significant difference while using this.,3
84738,"Had a 7"" mark through the middle like it had a curling iron lightly touch it.",3
109595,It doesnt have the same look when you ahve to use them inverted. They dont give off enough light to light the driveway.,3
107584,"a lot to choose from, how ever I do wish I would have looked at the pictures more closely. There are somethings I wont be able to use, such as a gun charm... also one arrived broken",3
116812,"Eh, the case started to tear at the edge. It hasnt been a while since I bought this case, and I didnt drop it or throw the case, but it’s having some tears on few spots.",3
118436,Dropped phone and it didn't protect the phone it broke.,3
116854,"The bag is small like what u would used for a toddler diaper bag and the color isn’t red, it’s pink. Overall decent",3
115947,It's serving its purpose but looked used when it arrived. There were scratched on it and a chip on the back of it. It will cost me too much to return it so I just kept it.,3
96201,The cover is quite large for my Artisan model! Looks sloppy,3
82007,I never realized how often my baby falls and hits the front and sides of her head till I put this on her. I would give it two stars but customer service was nice.,3
98649,"Let’s make this as simple as possible. It’s a beautiful image. However, the image quality is poor. It’s the equivalent of taking a photo from the 80’s and blowing it up on a bed sheet. The image is pixelated. The fabric material is the equivalent of a sateen-like bed sheet. (I intentionally used the word sateen) If you’d like to hang this over a window, this fabric does not block out light at all. Am I satisfied with my purchase, yes. Reason being...it’s a beautiful image. Will I purchase it again? No.",3
94940,Could be better for the price honestly. But still legit compare to scuff or others competitors,3
105852,I snapped one just trying to put my sweater in the closet.,3
97503,"Cheap, probably will replace in 12 months",3
88951,"I really enjoyed the book and all of its interesting lore. For some reason the pages came out weird, it seems like if the pages were folded and printed over and if the pages had small cuts out of it.",3
95441,"Ended up returning the Spotter V2. It looks like a really nice FPV camera and would have sat well on my RC car. However, it came with an in-line battery adapter with XT60 plugs (not mentioned in web product description). My car uses Deans T connectors. Crazepony Support could not provide me with info on how to hook it up.",3
80880,This.... It was just too fluffy and fantastical that I feel the only reason why cancer is mentioned is to differentiate it from other very similar novels and that just felt wrong.,3
117755,"looks better in picture. The design is original, but I wish the materials were better. looks cheap.",3
84733,"I bought these threaders because they appeared to be stronger and more easily held than the traditional metal ones - those qualities are true for these threaders; however, they are too large for the size needles I regularly use for sewing and embroidery. They work best with a large-eyed embroidery needle. My grandchildren love them for their sewing and embroidery projects.",3
88340,Fun but cheaply made,3
87889,"Nothing special about the set. The smallest sized wrench is so small its more like a bent wire. I wanted it as a backup set, and so far I haven't used them. Wrenches do not stay well in their position and its really hard to read the size on them.",3
118810,The overall product is decent but the quality is fairly cheap. You will be able to use it but make sure to clean it often and properly unless you want to have a weird and moldy smell for your shaker.,3
83442,It doesn't give a clear picture of the stud,3
93834,"Sooo, it felt like I missed a novel in the series when I started reading this. Decades have passed since the last novel, and I was a bit lost for a while. Good story, just not sure why they changed it so much.",3
86209,Earring was missing black stone at top.,3
97241,I returned this. The fit was okay but the slip underneath was so oddly colored that it took away from how cute the dress could be. They should make the slip the same color as the dress.,3
84268,The plug was too big but made it work a different way. Other than putting it through the device. A,3
89840,"This was a cute romantic story. Probably how in real life some go. Nice characters, drama, humor, a Happy ending. Enjoyed the closeness of friends and family. It's missing something, but I can't put my finger on it.",3
90092,"I mean in the end, it works. I bought it for my GameCube but every time I try to play a game it won’t register it’s there until I unplug the memory card and put it back in. It works in the end but it’s kinda inconvenient. Can’t say if this is also a problem on the Wii because I don’t have one",3
95918,I bought this product and was able to use it 2 times before it stopped working. It won’t turn on it won’t charge nothing. It was a waste of money and I wouldn’t recommend buying it. Update......At first I have this a one star rating. But the manufacture got in touch with me and sent me a replacement and I haven’t had any issues with it. It has been a good backup battery,3
87427,"I purchased these covers under the guise that they would fit on cans sized 3 ounces to 13 ounces. Sadly they do NOT fit my cans of Fancy Feast, which was my main reason in buying these. I didn't return them because they work great on the big cans of dog food we use. I'm pretty sure this also won't fit on the 6 ounce cans of cat food because they don't look like the stretch that wide. These are easy to clean and being different colors is helpful in case you want to leave feeding instructions and identify the cans by color. The ""spoon"" that comes with is a little flimsy for heavy food.",3
80685,"Received all 4 plants, 1 is doing badly, another one is not doing great, we unpacked them as soon as we got them, they haven't needed water yet, I'm hoping a little time will perk them up, but after 3 days the one is almost dead. Im hoping we can salvage 2, I bought then for my daughters birthday.",3

84693,"I bought this item with the intention of using it for breakfast items such as oatmeal, scrambled eggs, soups, ect. Unfortunately, it doesn’t keep them hot the way I expected it to. It’s still a handy little cup but I can’t microwave anything to warm it up while it’s in the tumbler. A bit disappointed.",3
114736,"I bought this to try protecting my cable since I broke 1 cable before at the connector points. The size fits lightning cables and also MacBook power adapter cables. It was a good concept, however, it adds a lot of bulk to the cable and it unwinds from the cable when you roll up the cables to put away. I think the product is too costly for the value.",3
116578,These are good for replacement or quick emergency goggles but not for everyday riding. The frame foam is hard and not very comfortable to wear day in day out. The fit is okay but not a good solid eye seal.,3
85139,'twas a gift to family member for keeping her blue tooth ear phones safe.,3

109858,No magnets on Earbuds make me feel inconvenient. And the Earbuds are NOT stainless steel as described in the web and simple plastic which looks very cheap unlike Sennheiser does.,3
82624,"We loved them, but the batteries only lasted about a week and then needed replaced. With over 10 of these, it was going to be expensive replacing the batteries each week or two.",3
81746,"It is a nice leash. I like the padded handle and the velcro to keep handle close on leash when not in us. I think it would be even better if the extension part had ability to attach as well to itself or be shorter by 6 to 8 inches so it could wrap around the dogs neck once and clip to collar ring for ""onboard"" storage and quick access while running free.",3
118060,"does not rise up around edges. i bought this as a gift for my little brother who has an iPhone 8. after taking it out of packaging and putting it on his phone, it almost seems like his phone will slip right out. im very scared his phone will be damaged due this unreliable case",3
