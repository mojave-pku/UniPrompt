55460,"First off, this took weeks to get here. I didn't realize it was shipping from China or I would have paid a few bucks extra and gotten one that was Prime. I don't hold that against the seller it's just that I didn't realize that when I bought it. The actual product is kind of crap. I tested the first 3 keychains, #1 worked just fine and is on my car keys. #2 didn't work at all, and #3 works some of the time (I have it velcro'd to my Fire remote). I thought at first maybe the receiver just doesn't work through walls (even though the transmitter was about 10 feet away)- but the keychain transmitter was able to ping in the exact same location so it's just a faulty transmitter. It does ping sometimes - but every time it has been after I'd already found the dang thing and brought it close to the transmitter to test that it was working at all. Defeats the point! I'm really disappointed in this product and based on 2 out of 6 (again, I didn't test the other 3 so it might be a higher %) not functioning as they should I'd say give this particular product a pass. One of the tested transmitters DID work and works well, so it's not a 1 star - maybe I just got an old/bad set.",2

When it does this, the only thing we can do is open the tray, and close it, and hope that it reads the disc right. Which it didn't this last time. While playing a brand new DVD (so no marks or scratches and it plays fine in every other machine in the house). Definitely buying a different brand next time. Oh, and as a side note -- the remote operates on the same frequency as my sound bar, so when I try to turn that up or down, it performs random functions on the DVD player.",2

As a result my brand new truck caught fire and now stuck with a $500 deductible to fix the damages,2

54784,"I can't tell you how long it took me to assemble the helmet. I had to put it down on the first try (AFTER my husband tried) because I just didn't have time. It is ridiculously hard to put the two pieces together because there are several connecting points that have to be aligned perfectly before it gets locked in. Because it's a flexible plastic, the points wouldn't stay aligned and it took considerable strength to push the parts together to lock in, once they were aligned. It was so frustrating. The helmet was one reason we chose this costume for a school presentation. And it was a hit, I will say that but it was so frustrating to assemble and I'm just glad I had the time to sit down with it. The jumper was fine but it is see-through. So be prepared to wear something underneath. My son wore skinny jeans and a T-shirt underneath.",2

Put 3 more new cheap batteries in, same symptoms, worked for the first 2 times then dead. Went and bought the Ever Ready Duracell batteries, the top of the line AAA batteries. Same symptoms! Very frustrated and very unhappy with the product. It seems to have a battery draw even with the light off. I use it now without the light. Thought about returning it for a refund or perhaps an exchange, but the directions and the language used on the box is French.

65363,This grill is very flimsy. Looks nice but that's about it. It arrived with missing screws. It was bent out of shape and even had a cut in the metal near the lid. The only reason I haven't returned it is because it took 3 hrs to adjust fix and assemble and i don't want to disassemble it. When cooking smoke comes out from all directions. The cover is just for show it does not close all the way. I do not recommend.,2

The template has the pulls being installed too low on the cabinet door, almost to the point where the overhang from the lower post is to the bottom of the door.

She charges it overnight then at work will turn it on and it dies rather quickly. TOO QUICKLY for a case claiming to extend phones battery!!

51880,"The two fasteners that secure the buckle on this belt are glued together. The back side has a flathead screwdriver slot, but the front end is just a smooth surface (ostensibly to eliminate any friction when buckling). However, since there is no way to grip the smooth front side, it’s impossible to break the glue lock and unscrew the pieces without damaging the belt. The comments tell you to grip the smooth front end with needle-nose pliers and then warns you to be careful not to damage the belt. But since that part is flush with the belt surface, the only way to grip it with needle-nose pliers is to dig into the leather to get the pliers around it. Some damage is almost assured if you do this. Poor design on an otherwise high quality belt. They could easily make the smooth front end with a flathead screwdriver slot just deep enough to get purchase to crack the glue. Then you'd just need two screwdrivers and no damage would occur.

Having more than just two height setting would address this issue. The seat is wider side to side than it is front to back. The reduced depth gave me the sense I was sitting on 1/2 a chair rather than a full one.

After a bunch of fiddling (and almost returning these) I discovered that if you put the boards into write mode first, then start writing a new sketch, and then press the boot button WHILE arduino ide/mongoose/etc is trying to connect, then the IDE will connect and start slashing the board. Also to note, this only seemed to be a problem on my windows computer. When I tried writing the board from Arduino IDE on Linux, simply putting the board into write mode seemed to work as expected. (I have no idea why) One more note, I could not get these boards to be recognized USB devices on Mac at all. Apparently there is a known driver signing issue between the driver for these, and Mac's running OS X 10.13 or higher, that to-date, has yet to be fixed.

63711,"This product was taped together with scotch tape and had clearly been opened previously. The contents seemed like they were new, all in plastic but a little discouraging.",2
77770,When I got this I needed to call to activate due to my computer not working. I was on hold for 17 minutes when I finally got mad and hung up. I would absolutely suggest not calling the hotline number. Make sure you have access to a computer/smartphone,2
54644,I saw results within a few weeks of using this product however I developed tiny pimples on my face.,2
78330,Had the unit a week short of a year before it started malfunctioning. It now refuses to cycle through all of the colors and brightness. Have to settle for a choice of three colors and low brightness.,2

60859,"These things taste really bad. Like a really really old nut. So I said of course it’s not gonna taste good out of this plastic container, did some research and people say boil them before you cook and season them so I did and it still taste like that old nut with butter and garlic hahahaha. Just going to grind them up and put them in my shakes. Also they are absolutely not WHOLE that’s a lie and a half. Disappointed in the purchase but know that another company will ha e better:)",2
41805,I really liked these bottles with their great labels and printing on the glass. But after a little over a month with normal use (spraying counters to clean) the nozzle split from the neck and started leaking all over when in use. It’s a pretty simple design so I don’t understand how this went wrong. Wish they held up cause I would’ve loved them.,2
59249,I didn't care for it to much,2
65291,Did not work for me. Clear click replaced it promptly but it still did mot work for me. Company is great. Maybe I just got a couple of bad ones. I would try it. If it works then awesome. If not the company is responsible and great service.,2
42608,So I bought this back brakes because I injured my back I had it for 30 days and the metal rods rip through the fabric other than that it worked great for my back for the time,2
51256,"Be careful the sizing!!! Will not fit a twin size bed although it says twin in the description. This mattress is fine for a floor pad, comfortable enough for the price. But I purchased it to fit a top bunk of a twin sized bed. It is far too narrow (about 4 inches gap on bith sides). Expensive mistake for not reading fine print.",2

50794,"Not gonna lie, This movie was boring. Didnt like any part of it. The actor didnt feel right in this movie. I dont badger on Actors, but i thought it was supposed to be a funny movie, but it was literally boring. Why did i even bother buying it. Dont recommend anyone to watch it. Sorry Ms. Schumer, but this movie was a bad movie overall.",2

56961,"This could be a good product, but its poorly designed. This is my 3rd time buying one of these and they always seem to leak after a few months. I ended up buying the Hoover power scrub deluxe and thus far find it not only cheaper, but easier to use and handle. It cleans just as well (if not better) than this model.",2
68884,"After second night, started to not work",2
70768,This is not very well made at all. It definitely runs large and the bottom flap sits in the middle of my son's back.it frayed after the first wash.,2
47434,Really disappointed. The rack is great but there are parts missing! It came without the toilet paper holder and the towel hanger.,2
76374,Comfortable but gets loose quickly,2
74292,"I have never, in 68 years, seen a more useless set of operating instructions called an operating manual. You might was well go down to your local and drink your way through the $30 purchase price and then come back and try to figure this out. A complete waste of time and...nothing on line, and nothing on You Tube. Have fun!!!!!!",2
49500,Works as advertised but I cannot get the flame to regulate. I have used high end fuel and low end fuel. Works the same both ways.,2
63132,"It is a cute bed! I like the look, and color. Assembly wasn't too hard-- I did it myself. I made a mistake and had to back-track a little, but I'm pretty sure that was operator error. Probably. Possibly. It is not sturdy for two regular adults. My husband gladly takes credit for the bent supporting rods underneath, and I let him. But, really, it's just super weak material and normal activities by normal sized adults caused both the top (by headboard) and bottom (by foot board) rods to bend. And in a weird place-- like 3/4 of the way down the rod! Not in the middle (like I could justify, because we cuddle together in the middle of the bed). And we'd only had the frame for less than 3 months when the first one bent. We just noticed the footboard one was bent at six months. I contacted the designers listed here via their website, and they directed me to the manufacturers, whom I never heard from after submitting my issue on their separate website and requested a replacement bar (at the time of the request, only one was bent, AND I offered to pay to replace it. Never heard back.) So, I'm shopping for a new bed. And husband is proud of himself. Probably worth the price of the bed just for the cloud 9 feeling he's riding high on...",2
63925,Shipped in a box 5 times to big and despite packaging not being damaged the roll was creased in multiple locations. At least I got the toolkit that many others didn't,2
62139,Broke like the second day I put it on. It still has sir bubbles and the day I put it on was on a 7 hrs car ride and messed with them the whole way and still in there. Kinda worthless.,2
66448,Made my eyes burn and produced big red rings around my eyes. I think I was allergic to it despite it being for sensitive eyes.,2

53032,"I liked this mat at first, but after 6 months it's half the thickness that it was and stiff. Barely cools now. I also purchased the Gel-O mat... It's smaller than the penguin but wins out over the long run. Would not buy this again.",2
46604,Too long and not as described,2
57745,"Left/Right click buttons and Scroll wheel are located too high . I have to lift hand to use and my wrist get tired in less than 5 minute of use. I made a 3/4 inch high wrist support and glued it on mouse pad and it working very comfortable. Palm rest come with it but still too low, need much higher palm rest. I will give 5 star if come with wrist supporter. I love the angle of the left/right click button and scroll wheel.",2
77606,Finger ring fell off after a week. Made very cheap.,2
57823,Despite closed captioning being listed it was NOT available. The quality of the video was poor as well.,2
69407,It was way to small. I ordered XL and was not able to wear to my party. I am normally a size 10 or 12.,2
58487,I am rather tall at 5 feet 11 inches so perhaps this is part of my problem. I may have a longer than average torso. The shaper is too short for me to cover the abdominal area and it meets at my navel and pushes all my weight to the place I wanted to hide. It also is not the material I imagined. It feels more like spandex shorts from the 80's or lycra style undies. I was sad because reviews had me excited for this item and I did not get what I expected.,2
69051,I am not happy with this my dog has yeast in the one ear now it has move into the other ear and I would not use this ever again.,2
50640,"This probably works if you can figure out the controls. My IQ is over 130 though and, even after spending 30 minutes reading the owners manual, I could not get the thing to program properly. I'm not sure if it's because the buttons don't work right or if its bad directions in the owners manual. Now I've misplaced the owners manual so it's just sitting here doing nothing. I wouldn't recommend this though, the one day I got it programmed properly, it was pretty nifty. Maybe if you're a rocket scientist you can figure it out. Or maybe you will get ones with buttons that work. Good luck.",2
66266,I'm not seeing a difference after a couple month use.,2
67358,Not very happy with it since the handle keeps rotating while sawing thus altering the cut pattern and there is no way to lock it in place!!!,2
46806,"I wanted to like these. The box they came in is incredibly well done, the product felt good but they are smaller than the side of the watch face. The problem is since they are tempered glass, no matter how you install them you will see rainbows in the screen as you are looking through the edge of the screen protector. If they were the proper size the edge of the protector would not be over a part of the screen you want to look at and these would be great. But 1 star because they are unusuable in my opinion",2
67138,My girl wanted this helmet because of the tiara but it came wrinkled ant without the red ornament. She was very disappointed.,2

I'm keeping these very thin cheap sheets as a back-up set because my husband systematically ruins all of our sheets and I needed an extra set. The pillow case openings have completely come apart where the hem is sewed down - both of them. I bought the baby blue CAL King and it's more like a light turquoise, which I really like. The fitted sheet is very deep which is also a plus. If you are looking for some just okay sheets, here ya go.",2
42913,Would like to give it a good review but they put a giant sticker over the instructions so I had to guess on how to use.,2

75824,"Dimensions of mine are 1 in x 2 1/2 in which is not the 2 x 3 inches promised. It's real, but has a lot of brown flaws making it dingy looking and it's smaller than expected.",2
77163,"the smell of the brace is disgusting, washed it several times and still it stinks and gives me a rash",2
60958,"I bought this after reading all the good reviews. Unfortunately I do not think it deserves such a high rating. The concept is good. But in practice this parachute is so small that it barely catch any wind. You barely feel any resistance. All it does is make you try to run fast, to get it catching the wind. This is fun for 20 seconds, then you are tired from the running. It is not just my opinion, but my kids as well. They play soccer and in good shape, and didn't feel like this product added anything to the training. I think it is a waste of your money to buy this thinking you will get good use out of it in a training session. I rarely put down a product, but it is simply not living up to its claims. Save your money and get something else instead. If you already bought one, try to return it. Otherwise just tie a GI-Joe doll to it (or Barbie) and throw it from a high place for some parachute fun. It is no better than a toy.",2
56574,"I tore a meniscus when standing up from a seating position with resulting pain and swelling up and down the leg. I found the ""brace"" difficult to wear. Too heavy for me to walk with.",2

55170,I expected this to be thicker material. The material is thin and am not as pleased with it,2
41690,The glasses were great! The ice molds were a let down. Only one of them held water and the other is essentially useless because it doesn’t hold the seal and water seeps out only making 1/2 and ice ball. Pretty disappointed,2
49484,"it has been about couple days since i started wearing this device. it checks heart rate every 30 minutes automatically which is pretty cool. for any fitness tracking, i think i have to manually start when i start working out. the cool part is that it actually detects when you fall asleep and record duration by itself. i wanted to find out about that the first night so i didnt touch anything from the device and well it did record my sleep hours including deep and light sleep. Very happy with my purchase.",2

Unfortunately, the boxes are all damaged so we are going to throw the top of the box away then place the elastic brown bow over the cellophane covered biscotti. Disappointing and not a great solution. Each box should have been wrapped separately to protect the box since the finish on the box is textured and fragile. Gave product 2 stars because the biscotti itself looks great; presentation awful.",2

77153,"At first I was happy with this kit but mostly ordered it for the gas lenses. I have to say after some use, the gas lenses are put together quite cheap. I had one separate between the brass and copper, and keep spinning each time I try to thread the cup on. Also it ruined some of my welding jobs because I was getting terrible gas flow. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting my whole TIG setup until I finally took one out, plugged the center hole, and tried blowing through it. I could barely move any air through it. Turns out one of the screens got clogged. I do not have any contamination in my line or any reason for it to get this way, nor did I ever have the problem with CK and other products I've used over the years. So I had to sit there and carefully pop the ring off and take apart the screens and only leave one of them in to get any gas coverage again. I don't think I'll be buying this junk again.",2

My phone dropped from my pocket onto the linoleum kitchen tile of all places, and promptly shattered. This was a nice case for a while, until it wasn't. I recommend something more heavy-duty. From the photo and price, I wasn't entirely sure whether this would do the job protecting my phone. Well, I've had it for over a year now, and so far no damage has been done at all.

It I can say definetly filters pretty well ""if it fits right"", however saying one size fits most is questionable. I realized this 15 mins into wearing it when I realized oh boy this isn't on quite right tightened it and dealt with the pain all day of a badly fitting but super tightened mask. If you have a long face pick the large size if my face wasn't so gaunt and thin from health issues it may have fit a touch better on the sides as well but they are still good. It's a bummer I have 2 face masks ""bought a double pack"" now that don't fit and only got to use one. The large size you can only buy in black and one at a time... this is a bummer but oh well I don't have much choice. If they made a sizing guide it might help out. I wish I could have tried these on previously but buying online that's what I get.

183684,"This movie is simply amazing. There is so much that can be taken away from the film that it is hard not to watch it several times over. I have only seen it in the Russian with English subtitles, but it is worth the time to watch. As someone who is frequently watching subbed work this film does an amazing job of allowing the emotion to be portrayed even in the subs and is able to make it an easy pace to follow even with slower readers. The story is one that anyone can relate too. The pains of growing older, discovering new truths about yourself and others, understanding and accepting the differences in us, standing up for you heart and what you believe in and it even manages to add in sibling understanding in to its plot. The CGI is also really good and makes the mystical creatures come alive. It also has such beautiful music that hearing it in any other language I feel would ruin the entire feeling that the movie produces. Hope you find this worth watching.",5

178514,"I honestly can't believe the price of this, as it's easily worth 2 or 3 times the price it's here for. I had a traditional diaper bag when my son was born, but it was a huge pain. I couldn't fit everything in it and when I did need something I had to dig around and make a huge mess. It had a ton of itty bitty pockets that I didn't need (like, pockets big enough for 1 baby sock kind of small) and it was bulky and took up a lot of space under the stroller or in a shopping cart. I hated it. Enter this bag. It's so lightweight but DURABLE. It's been tossed around, thrown in the back of the trunk, and it's still going. It's easily cleanable with a damp cloth for small messes and you can hold everything. best of all, it can be carried like a backpack (obviously) so no more digging shoulder straps!",5

185336,The digital thermometer is a great product. I have a traditional thermometer which need to keep long enough to get a temperature under my baby’s arm. It can be so hard to get a temperature when she is fussy. I like this thermometer because it's very easy to use. I just need to point and click at my baby’s forehead and I get the reading immediately. I highly recommend it to all parents.,5

We do a lot of trail running and it has worked great. I usually use the vibrate or sound, and have not even needed to resort to the shocker! But, the most awesome thing about purchasing this e-collar is the incredible customer support I received when I called them to inquire about replacing the remote, which I lost! They sent me a new remote at no extra charge! Amazing! I would highly recommend this system and a friend had already purchased one at my suggestion for his Lab. Thank you SO much for this great product and wonderful support!",5

I watched three cars run it over and felt my heart sink when I heard a loud crack every time...ran in and picked it up when the cars passed...and my phone is UNSCATHED. The case itself just has a crack in one of the corners but it's barely noticable...absolutely the BEST case I've ever had. Not to mention it's really thin and light, and aesthetically pleasing too.

189761,"You want to know something...these little speakers are the bomb! I can take them with me wherever I go. The carry case is perfect, the USB cable is just right. They are simple to use (they talk to you), and for what they are the sound isn't that bad. You could easily spend 4 times the cost of these speakers to get a portable speaker that you are most likely not going to enjoy schlepping around (and ISN'T stereo!). These speakers do a pretty good job of separating the sound - for the audiophile you are going to hear drop-offs in the the upper ranges and it's far from true bass, but when you go away for the weekend, for example, and want to bring tunes with you, these guys are the bomb!",5

You can still tell it is a protein powder (duh, you’re not going to get away from that) but it’s not strong or over powering, it doesn’t have an after taste, and it really does taste like chocolate milk without being too sweet. With milk it’s almost like a milkshake and with water it’s like watered down chocolate milk. So far I’m extremely impressed.",5
198070,"Got these for travel as they pack easily. Fit nicely, wear well.",5

170303,"I will update this as I use the cables but at first glance, they look really nice and appear to be of good quality. I have had the same 25' lifetime guaranteed cables for 30 years but wanted something shorter. I liked the tweed covered cables because they do not appear to tangle as much as regular rubber cables. These got great reviews so i figured I would give them a try. I like that they came with velcro ties to secure them when not in use. My one critique is that I wish that the ties were designed to stay on the cable when unsecured. This is a not a big issue. One just needs to remember to wrap the tie around the cable after releasing it.",5

181585,"""This is my fourth fitness tracker (all brands are different). I don't want to buy an expensive band, and it's important to decide which one is best for you. In the previous band, I was having trouble syncing to my mobile phone. The battery lasted for one day and the reading was not accurate. This fitness band surpassed all the other bands I bought. The first time you connect to the phone and set it up, no problem. Very easy to use and easy to use. I received the watch on Monday night and it is still going on - surprisingly he has been running for 7 days, can monitor my heart rate and sleep, I can use fitness elements; exercise, walk and bike. I found this watch to be very reliable, especially when I was working at school, now I don't need to worry about the battery affecting me. I like to sync easily with my phone and receive messages via my watch. My new fitness watch is very satisfying and will definitely recommend it.""",5

188388,Laser pointer works really well! The other flashlight feature is just a bright spot light. I think it tried to advertise being able to see previous blood stains with it but it’s just a bright flash light.,5
196061,"This short film grabbed my attention immediately and had me in suspense, it definitely needs to be a full feature film, it keeps you wanting more. Also, the quality of it was awesome which is also a plus in my book, great project. Corey B",5
176389,"If you have a first aid kit, this is a must have item! I've never had to use it on a human, but My dog cut one of his pads really bad and I used this to control the bleeding. Applied liberally and put on a dressing. Took him to the vet next morning for sutures.",5
192341,Very easy to use. This gem of a purchase comes with plenty of different sized nose vents. It would fit a tiny nose or a large mans nose.,5

175410,"When I received this comforter, my sister-in-law gave me one of her comforter. I thought the one she gave me would be better than this one I bought from Amazon but no, I was wrong. The quality is better than expected. I was surprised that it is actually EXTRA PLUSH so it provides extra comfort and softness. I love it so much because i sleep a lot. Also, it is light weighted yet very warm so I'm very happy with my comforter. The only thing is that it is very white and I worry that I might stain it so a cover might be my next purchase.",5

173996,Very well made. Very sturdy. Nice rich color. Plenty of room in the main compartments for 15 inch lap top and files. The interior pockets have are ample enough for me for additional items.The two exterior pockets are deep and and wider than I expected allowing more places to put your extra like cell phone etc. The stiching on this bag is very well done. Seems to me this bag should last a very long time. Did I mention it just plain looks great!,5
169442,Keeps the bugs off my face while mowing around bushes and trees or just working in the garden. I highly recommend this product if you hate bug bites!,5
188113,Purchased this case and was pleasantly surprised with strength of the magnets holding the flap/cover in place. There is definitely an orientation that works better. When done so the felt side is outward - the magnet hold is strong. When the glossy side is outward - the magnetic hold is less strong. I think this has to do with the nature of the open end being folded inward vs outward with the latter.,5
194289,The pack came neatly packaged and I am a huge fan of the coffee!! So convenient that it doesn't need to be refrigerated so I can order online. The coffee itself is delicious and the nitro makes it super smooth to drink. I'm also lactose intolerant so the oat milk latte has been a game changer... soo happy about it!,5
172909,"I just got these and used them this weekend to block out the Karaoke noise coming from a Bar on my block. I am used to City noise, but this is a whole other nuisance. I have a white noise machine that blocks out the (very bad) singing but I couldn't block out the bass. I put these on and in combo with the white noise, I could barely hear it. It was enough to allow me to go to sleep. Of course, these are not meant to be cozy for sleeping and you can only sleep on your back, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do. When you are desperate to sleep, you will literally try anything. I'm sure they look stupid, but I don't care because I was asleep. They fit my head tightly, so I'm sure if I wore them for a long time I would get a headache but the bar closes at 1am. I just woke up in the middle of the night and removed them. Works for me.",5

190090,"I’m very careful to use an all natural shampoo because I get my hair colored. This one does not strip my color and my color lasts much longer than with the other natural shampoos I’ve used in the past! I am sensitive to certain smells and I was unsure of how I would like this Lavendar smell! I love it, it is not over powering, just the right amount of scent. I have thin straight hair but the coloring sometimes leaves it a little dull and slightly hard. After using this shampoo I love the feel and look of my hair!",5

199365,"Bought this and installed just over a year ago and still working fine. The light is bright and easy to install. The construction quality is decent. It's light weight, but not too light to the point of those low quality strip light. The look is just like traditional light. Like it.",5
194538,Like this product. Didn’t realize when ordering I would get three inside of box. Only bad thing is that it did show a few small bubbles after I applied it and continued to press and rub on them but they didn’t disappear 100%,5

179842,"I’m not a huge fan of this genre, but when I started reading this, I literally couldn’t stop! The way it is written makes you feel very connected with the characters and will leave you wanting a sequel. The author creates a satisfying sense throughout the book that keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen. I was surprised that I loved it as much as I did and I would love a sequel and also to see this book turned into a film.",5

9669,Purchases to try to help my cat. 16 years old with a heart and kidney problem and walking a tight rope right now. She would not eat it and I did not even realize that it was supposed to be refrigerated after you open that. Or a girl that she would not eat it. I contacted the seller asking if I could return the unopened tub since I got two tubs and I believe they made a fair offer to return the money for one tub and help me just throw out the rest of it. So I supposed to get half of the purchase price back. Figured that was fair enough. Problem is when they refunded money they only refunded a quarter of the purchase price instead of half. Not sure if this was a miscommunication. So I am still trying to work on it.,1

I soaked them in hot water and Dawn dish soap and then thoroughly cleaned each and every one of them ...as soon as they dried the smell returned...I threw them in the trash after seeing that the oily residue was even leaving marks on my kitchen table. I don't know what it was but I was very disappointed in this purchase and was completely unable to use the product at all.,1
4599,"I bought these for my rugs going on my carpets. I based my purchase on reviews and I will say, these did not work. Within a day, my carpet was sliding and I don’t even see a point on why I bought them. Don’t waste your money.",1

25476,"This CPAP cleaning system uses UV light to disinfect which is fine. The problem is that you have to completely disassemble your hose, mask and water reservoir for it to work. The SoClean system is much better as the entire hose, mask and reservoir is disinfected at one time WITHOUT taking the CPAP unit apart and sterilizing it piece by piece..unless you have nothing better to do with your time. I sent this UV unit back and it cost me $10 in shipping so I'm trying to save you the time and money ordering this.

27435,This product did not help my poodle at all. It fit just like the picture showed but it rubs the penis of the dog because of where the velcro attaches to the unit. I even wrapped the sewn edge to pad where it hits. My dog was pretty much bed ridden so it wasn't due to him moving around. It caused us another problem.

I at for almost 15 minutes just pumping the button over and over, and the oil didn't move more than a 1/4 inch after all that. The buttons kept popping out and separating from the housing every 10 pumps or so. Taking it apart and putting it back together helped for all of about 5 pumps, and then it stopped working again. If it had better construction I'm sure it would be great, but in this form it is essentially useless. I finally looked it up online and found this is a huge issue with it, but for some reason those reviews haven't propagated to the Amazon page for the product yet.",1

What got me very upset is that I had to pay for The shipping to have it checked and eventually to get a refund. It cost me almost 50% of what I paid for the item in the first place! Most companies send a reverse shipping code so you don’t have to pay for it, specially when it’s a falty item or an issue that is not the user’s falt. Anyways, a couple of weeks later I got a replacement shipped, but amazingly I also had to pay for importing fees as SanDisk decided to ship a new one from the US and declared the price for customs (it was a replacement, and there was nothing in the box saying it was a replacement. Customs just charged as if I had just bought a new item full price!) Does it works? It works. Would I buy again?

Also, rust and dents every where. China steel/chinesium (if it is steel) Screw holes on one part of the table are not properly aligned with their respective part. I have tried flipping parts all around and trying new combinations but to no avail. The instructions being garbage do not help either. (See photo showing misalignment. The horizontal bar is slanted) Lastly, missing screws. Even if I were to misalign the holes on the table and try to screw them in, I cant, because about 5-6 out of 24 hex bolts are missing. (2 missing M6 x 55, and 5 missing M6 x 35, missing Allen key) My recommendation - get a used desk for much cheaper.",1

Not sure why her head is so yellow and she has skimpy brows but I was able to fix it with makeup. I pierced her ears and changed her lips and also gave her some brows. You could also use her without the head but I needed it so I put the work in. She is sturdy for the most part. She is a good buy especially if you are good with makeup.",4
133417,"so far I'm not unhappy, I have found some devices it will not work with.",4
139979,"These socks are great fabric and look well made, but they are HUGE! They come up to my daughter's thighs. We fold them down, so it's not a huge deal. I was just surprised at how long they are.",4
122771,"I like the customization of all the buttons. Drawing pressure makes a difference, nice fluidity. Froze a couple of times when I drew close to the edge of the drawing area, had to unplug and plug back in.",4
126122,"I use this projector as a home video projector. I use it in place of a tv. While it does come with speakers, they were very tin sounding and gave me a headache. Instead, I ordered separate $20 computer monitor speakers and the combination work great. This projector did have a wear frame skipping thing going on with one of my laptops though because the FPS match was 1 off. My projector runs at 59 FPS which I cannot change anywhere. I have to use a separate laptop and change my laptop’s core settings to be flexible with this and to force it to stream up to 59 FPS. Other than that, the picture is good, focuses well, the planing is good, nothing else to note!",4
158089,Perfect fit summer nights where u just went to leave the window open and no mosquitoes biting at you,4
137359,"It’s a very heavy duty product. I was looking for an extension cord which is flexible as I have lot of power cords which take lot of space when powered in. This is a very smart device as each single station can be rotated and it can accommodate large power cords too easily. Another cool feature is USB adaptor which can be used to charge phone directly. There are two limitations with the product though 1) as I understand from using it, it does not has over charge protection 2) the max current combined of the USB port is 2.1 A which is kind of less if both the USB stations are in use",4
120219,Absolutely love the crackers the flavor if you’re doing low-carb I give them a thumbs up. The downside is they are very costly for a cracker and I wish I could buy them somewhere and not have them shipped because they arrive mostly broken up. I had a hard time finding one whole cracker in the bay,4
136912,Not that easy to program but it's sturdy,4
158848,These pens skip a lot when I'm writing on something right on top of a desk. No problems with notebook-bound paper though.,4
158151,"great item at a great price, works well with no leaks so far",4
139445,"Great deal, but the smell is quite strong.",4
133103,Definitely runs small. Had to return the first pair but the size bigger fits fine,4
155404,this was delivered quickly and was easy to set up. did a great job reducing the humidity in our basement,4
142642,"Wife loved it, but it had some grammatical errors.",4
154649,Excellent for detangling. Keeps natural hair from matting up.,4
124551,This Item Came A Little Different From The Picture But Was Still Very Cute. The Colors Were The Same. I Love It!!!,4
156042,"Very strong product. Generally does a good job, but I would only use it for spot treatment. Every time I lathered it on a big area it leaves my skin very red.",4
126523,Fits a little longer than others I have purchased but so cute.,4
139156,It is nice color but my lips feel sensitive when I put this on.,4
136566,A Tony bit smaller than I expected but it does the job. Great price,4
156160,It is a very well written paranormal romance that draws you in from the beginning. The relationship takes place on the psychic and physical plane and you get an intimate look at both Rage and Pandora and really understand their motivations and their feelings. Maybe it is a little rushed but that's my opinion mostly because I prefer slow burn romances... Like previous books I really liked this one to.,4
124133,I read the reviews before ordering and i got them and i really like them. Not as true to color as the picture but close enough.,4
122539,"At first I was really excited about this find. It looks sleek and nice. It fits under cabinet fine. But when lifting the head, it hits the wall, so it has to be pulled out some, wouldn’t be a big deal, but the awesome thing that keeps it from bouncing around(suction cups on the bottom), makes it a bit of an ordeal. But easily ignored. The one thing I am very disappointed about, everytime I use it, is how far the mixing tools(paddle and whisk) are from the actual bowl. Easily 1/4 of an inch away. It makes the mixture leave a layer of mix against the bowl, never to be touched by the mixing tools. So it HAS to be turned off and sides scraped, multiple times during use. Way past the time to send back, and is better than having nothing. However, I would look for one that has the mixing tool much closer to the edges of the bowl, so you really can leaving it mixing to itself.",4
150888,"Looks a little cheesy, a little smaller than I thought it’d be",4
153535,Letters are too small to read from my chair to me TV stand.,4
122050,"The pillow case, zippable, is wonderful. The first night I used I put my pillowcase on it. It was stuffed and I knew it would too high. However, I used it. My neck ache was worse. I removed three handfuls of the foam the next night. It was better. Removed four more large handfuls that night. Much better next morning. Future buyer: you may have to adjust the amount of filling to suit your needs.",4
159778,"This attachment is awesome. The adapter raises the possibility of the Headphones. Audio sounds great coming from the adapter, but the volume is not as loud as it is wired. One big con is their is some type of sound that the adapter makes. It sounds like there is a bit of frequency. Another con of the adapter is the price. The way the buttons click and the adapter feel is not what you would expect from something that cost $50. If this product was between $30-40 it would be fair. Another con is the batter life is on the short range. It is not terrible but if it could last 2hrs longer it would be perfect.",4
134755,The dress is exactly as pictured and really very pretty. It fits my daughter but may be a tad big around the chest. Not too big that she can't wear it. She's tall and lean so overall it probably is true to size. Definitely recommend it.,4
143996,"The card was very nice, I wouldn't normally order a card online but it was way easier than going through a million cards at a store.",4
157791,Sofa is great!! Just want cushions to remove,4
157808,They work and I like the white light they emit,4
159794,"My wife loves this stuff. Personally, I think it smells as though Cheech and Chong just stopped by for a visit whenever she uses it.",4
122365,"Arrived well packed and undamaged. We have only been out one weekend depending on this battery to power our travel trailer but it powered everything we needed, including a small 12v fan at night, with very little power loss, it performed beyond our expectations!",4
148204,I enjoyed reading this story. A very good storyline and great characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys cozy mysteries.,4
152058,"This holster is perfectly molded to the Taurus Judge Polymer Public Defender. After a little work adjusting the retention screws for best hold, it is a nice, protective, very useful holster.",4
134886,Fit my wife's swollen leg.,4
127278,It doesn't fit completely over the screen. It will serve the purpose of keeping the screen clean. Easy wipe off.,4
148507,Fun game for the family.,4
139702,Good until it got a hole in it. Now I need to find where it's at.,4
128766,I got this since I was getting tired on paying for the blood stripes. It's a lot more convenient and seems to be pretty accurate compared to blood and urine stripes.,4
131672,"Nice tables,only took about 10 minutes to put together. Sturdy. We bought for use as bedside end tables for a guest bedroom",4
132007,"Bought this set as a great deal for special event decoration. Length of one was sufficient to string along three, 8 foot table lengths (end-to-end). Appreciate that these are battery operated and have a choice of programs. Hubby was even impressed that the battery casings looks to be safe enough for outdoor use. Perfect for lowlight indoor table settings, lit backgrounds, garden lighting (YMMV) and kids' room decor.",4
121519,I wish they were wider. I put two on the same side and have to set them at different levels to fill the gap.,4
122778,Received . Very nice . Recommend it highly,4
135223,Very good. Well worth it,4
144103,Really like the iPad case,4

130443,"My son enjoyed his socks, he had crazy sock day at school. The only thing I didn't like was that one pair looks more for like a girl.",4
130205,Great pressure from this little thing. Easy to set up.,4
142803,It was a gift. Seemed ok,4
122610,The instructions were solid until the top of the closet. Then they were lacking a way that made understanding the process ridiculously challenging.,4
121474,"Exactly as expected, maybe better.",4
150267,Definitely worth the price. Instructions are very vague but any do it yourselfer can figure it out. Had to use a thread chaser on one of the bolt holes but no big deal.,4
139800,"My Aunt loved the bracelet as always with Alex and Ani, I would've gave it 5 stars but this item does not come in the box! I had to grab an old one of mine, it comes in a baggie",4
135077,I have this hung in my guest bedroom. It is a nice addition to the space. Easy to hang.,4
141936,"This is a very detailed, thorough, and truly global treatise on the Great War. Keegan has painstakingly researched and cross-reference this work. As you read you are at one moment seeing the politics and war plans as from a great height, and the next you are hearing the words of men muddied and bloody in the trenches. While one can certainly sense this is written from the eyes and mind of an Englishman, Keegan does justice to the experiences of French, German, Russian, and the large myriad of other nationalities who participated in this disastrous conflict. Well done.",4
148479,"Very firm, but does help with arch support.",4
146252,"Just installed this. I'll concur with others; the knockouts at the bottom are more like faint scoring. Better to use a hole saw or Dremel to get the job done. Another weakness to the product for me were the terminal connections inside the box. The terminals were really too small and cheap feeling, in my opinion, especially if you're going to attach a pool motor or 20 A load. If you properly wire those, you'll find the necessary wire gauge is a tight fit.",4
125691,"I like how Kelly used a lot of Scripture in order to help us transform our mind which is exactly what God tells us to do. I especially liked thinking about how I am not God's co-worker even though that sounds good on the surface. Instead, I am God's daughter. I really meditated on that part and it was so freeing since I'm in a busy time right now where I have been living like I needed to do everything in ministry perfectly for God to love me. The one thing I wish was different is that I wish this was printed like a workbook. That is how Kelly intended this book to be used, but it wasn't published that way. I thought it was going to be more reading than it was. Instead it was kind of like reading a lot of blog posts and homework assignments all at once. So if you are looking for a Bible study on the topic, this is a good one.",4
133838,Too big for our pool,4
142024,"I had gel polish on my toes and fingers. It took 2 thick coats or it to come off my toes, which I thought was great!! I used it on my acrylic nails and it melted them.",4

122090,"Good pair of sticks, it's like a longer 2B",4
150251,I love this. My favorite part is that the pad has perforated edges between the grocery list and the menu so that the menu can stay on the fridge and the list can go to the market.,4
126141,Works as intended - in my case - using it strictly as a archive device - thus it's not plugged in all the time - I plug it up - do my archiving & then disco it ... no issues ...,4
131087,"This thing was AWESOME.... until it stopped working a few days later. I used it a lot, but then one of the pads stopped functioning. Had to return it, but customer service was awesome and sent me a brand new one. So far, no problems and great with pain management! Highly recommend!",4
158234,Needs to be updated since the author has changed a few things on his blog.,4
155330,"The rectangular upright bin is huge! I thought it would be used to store files vertically so it wouldn't be that wide, but it's actually wide enough to store them horizontally. I guess that might be good for some, but I would have preferred if it was not that big. The post it bin is also a little large, but it's fine. The set altogether is very nice.",4
149425,Story was amazing. Ending could have gotten there much sooner.,4
139453,My first impression I have is they are very stiff. The synthetic soles seems to be very aggressive for basically an everyday walking shoe. They have ridges that look like they will fail after a short period walking on hard surfaces. When I put them on they fit very well. They are stiff but will hopefully loosen up after wearing for awhile. I wish the sole was rubber. My biggest concern will be the durability of the sole. I think they will be nice shoes. Time will tell.,4
145960,Liked the package but would have liked napkins to be lol also they were pink,4
141895,Organic and reasonable. Roasting is well done. Bean quality is very good.,4
151734,I do like the soft silk material and it keeps light out sufficiently. I don’t like that this mask goes all the way to my hairline which makes forehead sweat and break out. I also don’t care for the adjustable part of the band as I can feel the plastic against the back of my head at times. I had the previous version of this mask and it was narrower on my face which I liked but the elastic band stretched out after a year. I’ll wear it but also keep looking for one a little smaller.,4
158491,"The oil is lighter than others and easy to work in, which is a big plus. Decent brush and comb set. The brush hairs don't just fall out after a single use. Overall, a good product for the price.",4
152295,Worked as expected. Every now and then a black blip on screen prevented from giving 5 stars,4
156871,"This thing is rugged and works well. I do wish that it came with bolts and wingnuts for mounting but I get that they can't know the thickness of what you're mounting it too, but a good guess would have been real nice.",4
130613,"Havent had this very long, but loving it so far. Seems to be well made and cuts right now. Really easy to use and fits in the hand user friendly. I recommend. 4 stars cause nothing is perfect.....",4
145838,"Mine were almost a year beyond the Best Buy Date. Still tasted ok by me. I will buy again. I don't really like the warnings on packaging, except when it was made.",4
153441,4 star playing tray. Works well for its functions. Fairly easy to set up and your child can use it as they please. They can use it to draw or they can use it as a table to put food on or other toys to play with. Only negative is it doesn't have an adjustable height for larger kids.,4
122751,"Great product, wires and adapter are sturdy. Wires are together which avoids tangling. Only wish they were longer (to use on other batteries / machinery).",4
159422,"Delivery as expected, will by from seller again.",4

153488,Initially Flashlight completely stopped working after 2 weeks. Cree saw my original review and send me a new flashlight. I just charged the flashlight and the flashlight seems to be working. Haven’t used it yet but I’m excited to.,4
122255,"Extremely well paced! Not a lot of ups and downs but continuous forward momentum. Great characters and sultry bad girls, loved it",4
124368,convenient for the minis...but quite a bit flimsy...but then again...it is silicone,4
142381,My massage clients like the extra padding this provides on the head rest. I wish it was slightly bigger so it would fit the head rest better.,4
129848,"This fit very well, on my Brinkmann fairly well, though it is a little tight. Even though it is a 72 inch cover and my grill is a 72 inch grill, the cover could use a little slack on the ends so I don't have to worry about the sharp edges ripping my grill cover. The material feels very strong, but several repeats of putting it on and off I expect there to be some fabric wear in the corners of the grill cover because of how snug it was over my grill. There are little loops and clips for attaching it underneath the grill so if you are planning on long term storage it is really great!",4
136123,Nice but bigger than what I was looking for.,4
139005,I use this daily and have noticed a difference!,4
157720,"Air-tight, simple design. A bit awkward to get the butter out when cooking, or at the table, because it is double the depth of a European stick of butter. Overall, I like it. I'd buy it again.",4

136304,Giving 4 stars just because they’re pretty thin,4
149887,Cute ice cream set for my daughter. The pieces are made very well. There is a magnet on the cone to he the scoops of ice cream on. I would have given it 5 starts if they made the container large enough to store all of the pieces!,4
150381,It wasn't good legit hair,4
141298,"made from good quality , lots of space inside for put in more stuff",4
135458,"I like the product. Takes a but of time to fine tune but I like all of the options for alerts and protection. My main issue is with the app and Bluetooth. It's Bluetooth range isn't great (must be in same room)... Also, the app lacks watts in or out and only shows Amps. Lacks any kind of performance charts or graphs. Just shows last DoD, Average DoD, Deepest DoD, Total Watts Discharged vs Charged (weird that they convert that to watts but not live Amps to Watts...), Lowest vs Highest Battery Voltage, and a few other things. Some charting would help with battery health tracking. All in all, it's a decent BMS, my favorite feature is the estimated time you can run whatever load till whatever custom DoD% you choose is reached.",4

125951,I liked the colors but I didn't think the value was that great for how many you get.,4
125964,"Definitely fun... got it to relax myself and absolutely it helped a lot. It felt too soft and the breasts were plump. Two holes are definitely tight enough and the mouth was crazy with teeth, but those are just some plastic ones and with tongue, it definitely had a different feel. Not so big, just a decent size.",4
154933,The fabric is very soft,4

123202,"First I want to point out that the one I received has a scratch down the middle. Not to happy about that because I spent 10 bucks and some odd change on it. However, with that being said, it isn't that noticeable and I highly doubt my 7 year old will care. That is the only negative I have about this binder. Everything else looks good, and I am excited for him to open it on Christmas.",4

138150,"Great cam, good image. Tough to get mounted the way BETAFPV wants you to mount it. I had a hard time getting the pins plugged all the way down so it kinda screws with the tilt of the camera. It is a very tough cam though. I hit a 2x6 rafter beam at almost full throttle and all I had to do was re-focus the camera lens. Looking back, I should have just not used the factory mount and de-soldered the pins and just wired it straight in and used foam tape to mount it.",4
142771,Loved the story line and characters but as usual the first chapter keeps repeating the paragraphs and I did skip over some because it was so boring and retentive.,4
121514,Nice little lights for craft projects. Work well.,4
123253,This was a gift nD I don't know much about it other than the recipient was pleased with it. It was a bit smaller than I thought though.,4

150470,The leash seems to be made good and a good price here.,4
156903,It's just 'ok'. Feels cheap. Delivered quickly and as expected. My order came well packaged. Its design becomes a distraction. Not as expected.,4
125733,Cute set - But directions have no words and are not great picture illustrations. Basically a guessing game based on the actual picture from the front of each packet.,4
134434,Okay but seems cheap,4

152152,"The instructions should be more in depth, for people new to sewing. I have been seeing all my life, so I everything is self explanatory. I really love this set! I have always made my own bias tape, these just save my fingers. (being burned) lol.",4

151768,A very nice percussion massager that works efficiently to loosen muscles.,4
128369,"this lamp is just as stated, i love the brown finish, it was easy to assemble, it is a little unsteady, but that was in the instructions. It works well where I have it beside the couch and wall. The brightness is nice, I would like it if it had a slightly brighter light, for my own needs, but it works just fine and would recommend it to others for a side lamp with shelves!! I really like this product.",4

150356,"I could not give it a higher score as I found to small to fit my D3400 and lens. I returned it and got the 300 instead, I like what I saw to see if the 300 would give me the room I need for my Camara and hiking needs. Loved the pockets and light feel",4
147661,They are good for the price. Easy install. The yellow is very 3k in color but not as bright as I expected. They created less light than my halogens. They look good though.,4

133627,"I had used the Valspar Chalky spray paint and loved it - unfortunately it seems to have been discontinued so when I saw this product I was excited. I bought 12 cans in 3 colors to finish a few projects I had. I used the serenity blue on a cedar chest. The first can clogged halfway through the can and couldn't be unclogged. Additionally, the paint is very thin and even with light coats has a tendency to run. In order to cover fully it took 5 coats. On a positive note, the final color and product in very pretty. I have 2 colors and projects left and I am afraid that I will encounter the same issue with clogging (the other issues I can work around). Updated - contacted Rust-Oleum - They attributed the clogging to the need for more shaking before using and offered to replace or refund me for the wasted cans. Customer service rep. was very nice.",4
137383,"Good looking containers. I bought two of them and one is holding up well while on the other one, a corner of the wood cracked and split wide open. I am disappointed by that. I am puzzled by what happened.",4
132726,Nose was slightly raw by the end of the box. Wish they offered these with lotion.,4
123445,"Over all I love this case so much! The silicone is soft and sturdy, it doesn’t make it much bigger than the phone already is. My main issue is the condition of the case itself. The first time I purchased this case the paint was damaged and off center. Not too noticeable but still a let down. After the case got messed up by my friend’s house rabbit I decided to buy another one. The second case arrived in perfect condition. The paint wasn’t scratched or where it wasn’t supposed to be. I was extremely content. But after trying to put it on my phone I realized it didn’t fit. I’m not sure if they sent me the normal 8 version but the camera cut out cut out my camera so I’m buying the case again and hoping and praying it works this time. Third times the charm. Besides that. I’ve received so many compliments and smiles from my phone case. I think the only reason I would recommend it to someone or buy it again in this case is because of its authenticity and originality. You can’t find this case many places.",4
158806,"Totally great product for a phone stand. However the ""flexible"" USB-C port makes it so placing you phone on the stand is a battle with geometry. I spend too much time trying to line up the phone perfectly with the port. Also no fast charging is a huge let down.",4
138856,Works well - easy to use.,4
123264,"it felt very stiff, which i didn’t like. and the seeming on the edges looked very cheap.",4
153583,Bought these for light duty hiking on good trails in warm weather. Colors and pattern not very attractive and do not appear to be very thick or cushiony at first. Surprised that they actually function very well. Very strong elastic gives support and no sag after several washings. Worn every day for 3 plus mile morning walk for a month. No blisters or bunching. Did not notice much moisture wicking. Would like better color selection and thicker weave. Very good value for the price would buy again.,4
147108,"I really like this band, it's fit and the clasp is easy to use. I was able to reduce the size of the links very easily with the kit that comes with the band. My only problem is how the color came off almost as soon as I started wearing it. I like this band and don't want to wear a plastic one.",4
128722,Bought these for my Gravely 460. Same blade but not as sharp as when I buy them at the local dealer but for $25 less I can use a file.,4
138890,My granddaughter is love these however they are two stiff to make them move they need to work on the mechanical part of them,4
159154,This rug is very nice! Rolled out fairly flat and looked really nice after vacuuming it. Very happy with the color and the new smell is very faint. Will likely purchase a pad to go underneath as it slides on my hardwoods and would like a bit more cushion. Otherwise very happy!,4
132226,"It works like a normal pop up toy. Yes - the music is not recognizable until the very end of the theme, but it's still cute. Some of the other reviews had mentioned that they couldn't get the Mickey to stay down after he popped up - we found that you have to hold the lid down and then turn the handle, then it will lock into place. It also has one little dent in it - but nothing severe.",4
135044,received item and it fits well,4
143262,The fog lights are good the only thing I had trouble with is keeping the bolts tight.,4
142472,"Great cardio that really tests endurance and strength, high quality rope/coating.",4
126615,"Love these shoes, very comfortable!",4
124320,Delivered as promised; looks like it will do the job,4
136425,The couch looks nice and is reasonably comfortable. Very difficult to put together . Very poor directions screws of different sizes all packed together no measure scale. Found the same couch on line at a much cheaper price. It does come with a cover that was a good bonus.,4
144610,"This is a wonderful product for me. The color is very natural and it's super easy to apply. The toughest thing (I would think) is not knowing when you are running low. I have no idea how long it will last and you cannot view the remaining pencil. But, in all other ways, love it!",4
121392,"Worked great for 3.5 years. Then one of the heating bars, made of glass, fractured. Kind of a dramatic way to retire a toaster. Because it was one of the top bars, I almost didn’t even notice it. Pretty dangerous if you ask me. Before that, it worked great. Perfect for toasting and baking. Only downside was the dials need to be turned up all the way and then set to the desired time. Otherwise the timer might not turn off, which of course is a fire hazard. Now that I have to seek out a new one, I may or may not try this brand/model again. Still undecided.",4
149824,"I returned this product, I ordered it in error.",4
141001,a great find for a fair price,4
130326,4 stars for doing what it does. (accelerates super glue to instant curing. But container is small and mine leaked out some product during shipping. Larger container for less money available HD site now.,4
131091,"The quality of the set is real nice and the case. Package arrived on time. The actual box that the kit came in, looks like it was used. Overall nice.",4
139710,"Very soft and so cute! I am TALL, 6 ft 1in. (all legs) with flat boots and this dress hits about 2 inches above my knee. I love the pockets!!!!!!! I have the red and navy and there is no difference in sizing between the too. I normally wear an 8 dress, but ordered a L in these.",4
134879,Everyone agreed it was super creepy! Had my husband drill a hole in the mouth for a straw and I was all set.,4
147839,Nice bag thought it was black but was actually blue,4
121306,"Works great so far. Great color and texture. The only minor (minor) issue is this: the velcro strap that allows you to wrap the wire up and secure it doesn’t fit over the plugs, so instead of conveniently adhering to the wire at all times, even when not being utilized, it is unattached.",4
156752,"Its great, kinda scratches easily but buffs out and the shelves fall if you're not careful. But otherwise looks great!",4
125640,"Really wanted this to work, but it didn't work on my Pixel 3, even plugged in, my phone was still listening, which really speaks to the nature of the phone rather than this device. It does, however, work on my MS Surface Pro 3.",4
138228,It’s tricky... you have to find the perfect amount of gel too put because if not you’ll have a mess all over the place. Needs better instructions too.. also if you’re doing longer nails I recommend you put a fake tip under because the gel breaks off,4
159460,"Easy to use and well designed! I love that the remote has a clip! The only reason I cannot give it a 5 star is because the first one died out after a few uses. However, the seller made every effort to replace it free of charge so I can try it again. Excellent customer service and a happy customer!",4
144547,I bought for someone and I didn't know it well,4
133386,Needed a blue polo quickly. Honestly the quality is there.,4
149690,So far so good! It has really come in handy for adding protection to my laptop!,4
149052,Spray is not powerful enough. Easy to use.,4
121610,Leaks a little bit great overall,4
154031,As advertised. Packed well.,4
129619,"Durable and fun for my toddler, only wish it was a bit larger.",4
156328,"It's a scale, you can pick up the same one at the local Walmart. This does not have a backlight and is hard to see in a poorly lit room (this was the case on a previous trip at night in a hotel room). Seems to be accurate so everything else was fine.",4
130218,I love it but as easy as the disk fell off I wish that it would have come with 1 or 2 replacements.,4
137891,Was skeptical at first but it works and fits my printer. Will update have to update review after a couple more prints.,4
138981,The headphones where meh.,4
128358,"I really like these guys. I have naturally short (Asian) lashes,and struggle to find falsies that don't make me feel like I have giant fans on my eyelids. Their short length works great for me. These are cheap with a solid thick black band, but if you apply on top of black liner, you're good to go. (I usually find thicker bands are a little easier to apply, at least for me.) I do recommend as cheaper falsies with great value. I will buy again.",4
139391,My students love these sensory items.,4
153999,I use it to heat up the window area of my condo where my orchids are. Seems to fend off the frosty feel from the large windows.,4
137192,Super cute socks got them for a gift for someone and she lived them,4
149251,"I hang vintage Asian textiles over doorways and windows. One new window is framed in Hardie Plank and I could not get push pins to stick in, which is what I'm able to use at the doors and windows with original wood framing. I bought this Velcro strip and it worked fairly well. The sticky side stuck to the window frame perfectly. However, although the sticky side seemed to stick to the textile, and I mounted it on the window frame, it fell down. I thought at first my cat had pulled it down but I discovered that the glue did not hold onto the fabric. I sewed it to the fabric, using light weight thread and long stitches. It has held up now for several days so I think the problem is solved. This package was more than enough for the project and I will save the remainder.",4
137175,"Seems to work pretty well, less messy than other lubes",4
121065,"These are very cute, just know that the toe is very pointy.",4
146960,Love her voice.....especially love Kennedy and Monroe (sure to be a hit).,4
149702,"Lettering is shiny and looks somewhat cheap and shirt is made of a stretchy, almost swimsuit material that wrinkles easily. However, it is true to size and very comfortable, I have no real complaints!",4
156878,This thing is awesome light weight and is very easy to use all my friends want to borrow it when we go rockhounding,4
159227,As promised Good Quality-Thank you,4
149040,I had to pre-order and wait because they were sold out as soon as they became available. They are really comfortable and look nice. I wish waist band was more elastic. A few stitches were broke when I was trying to wear them.,4
158193,Nice container but I think I paid a couple of dollars more than Walmart is selling this for.,4
156084,Pretty good looking wig had to cut it to get a perfect pixi wig but not a bad buy good hair,4
135264,Cute. The Velcro is easy to unsnap which is very convenient when taking off a sleeping baby. The border seemed to curl a little after washing and drying. Kind of thin material but overall a great buy.,4
139014,Nice Rifle Holder. Very easily mounted. You do have to be easy with them. My first set broke about the fourth time I put a rifle in them. I was out of the return window by about 7 days but the Company made it right and sent me a new set once I sent them a picture of the broken piece. Very easy to deal with.,4
155997,"What a great start to a series, I can't wait to read more. It does start a little slow but it picks up fairly quickly.",4
125911,The lift supports were easy to install and worked well,4
150922,"This product came in a really nice clear plastic container/dispenser, with three rows containing nicely made dice pieces. The container was a much appreciated bonus because it provides a good way to protect and store the dies, and dispense them as needed. Highly recommended and a very good value.",4
125581,Everything was good except for the fact the instructions are in Chinese. Had to use Google Translate but overall it wasn't hard to assemble.,4
122960,so far it looks good......obviously plastic so lid was a slight challenge to install and doesn't shut tight without lock (keeping it locked for a few days to see if it helps keep it down).....may be a bit pricey for plastic..........will fit in between a table and wall perfectly in our kitchen.....great design for our needs,4
136466,The arm band broke on the child's wrist side. The adult wrist on the harness is too small. Fast Delivery,4
142667,The size of the hat is much smaller than the normal adult male,4
153407,Solid tool. Great to have for stubborn cv axels.,4
130875,Great for the price but it is a bit generic. The elastic in the top of the shorts bunches up - but I have a 4 year old son who loves basketball and he thought this was the best thing ever. :-),4
130459,"I love this cover. It is super soft and stretchy, plus it’s very cute. Unfortunately my stitching is already coming apart after 2.5 weeks of use. Perhaps I just got one with faulty stitching.",4
132129,I've used this religiously for 1 week and have not noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I will use all four pens and update my review. I'm changing my review from 2 to 4 stars. This does work but it works very slowly. I am definitely noticing after almost 2 weeks that my teeth are whiter. The trick is to dry your teeth before applying and try to keep you lips away from your teeth for as long as you can so that the product can dry on your teeth. Do this right before going to bed to get the best results and with persistence and patience you will see a result.,4
142197,I like the audio quality. Unfortunately the speakers don't all sync up on bluetooth.,4
132722,"So far so good, we will just have to see how longevity goes, only time will tell.",4
128650,they were for baby shower gift but they felt durable and well made,4
131447,Slightly difficult to use. The large needle is the easiest to use but only 1 Is in the package. I’ve been able to remove several spots. It takes a little longer for them to disappear but overall a good product.,4
131114,Great litter but the smell is horrible. Hopefully they can make it scent free in the future.,4
145681,"Grew up using these, great pricing for the set",4
150711,"Very nice toy, excellent for creative kids and adults. The only thing that I didn’t like is the instructions shows figure that uses more parts than the one came in the box.",4
145768,I bought this product and it has given me more energy & I have even lost five pounds.,4
135660,Product comes out white but once you wrap it in and turns on most clear still lose a little bit of a wait cast but that’s to be expected if you want any protection I think. The one thing that I don’t like is that it comes a little runny. When we shake up the bottle before applying some of it gets stuck in that cap lid. Because it is a little more runny a lot squirts out of the bottle at a time you have to be careful with it especially if you’re having your child try to apply it on themselves . The good thing about it being a little bit runny as it’s very easy to spread on your body and rub in.,4
130040,My son really likes it,4
135866,"The case is great! This replaces another case that destroyed itself when it protected my phone. I gave it 4 stars because the only part that isn’t protected is the ringer on/off area, which is an empty hole. The other buttons are well covered, but at first, I thought that it just fell off or was defective. However the photo does she there is a hole there. Strange to me. Otherwise this is a good, tough case.",4
141806,I like that this product includes accessories. The charger is not as well made as the original buy gets the job done. The included tool is very handy.,4
154659,"I'm a size 16 pants and I purchased the XXL in black, and the waist is a bit loose. These are like running nylons, very thin, but very comfortable. I love the side pockets, the high waist and I love the length; hits me just below the knee. I will buy again, only in a dark color because I think anything lighter will be completely see through, I will try an XL next purchase.",4
127466,on time good product,4
115248,I cant play my fav game.,3
104630,"The product is overall ok. In a 100 pack I've used 50 Lanyards, 2 of those 50 have been defective. Overall good and would still purchase again.",3
110316,Had mystery and romance a plenty! Nicole Jordan books are always filled with adventure. This book was a reading pleasure.,3
97860,Not too good quality,3
109746,"Nice spacious bag. Can fit multiple items, especially if you have multiple children. The only problem I have is the chemical smell of the bag. This makes me question what could be in the materials to emit such a strong, chemical odor.",3
107813,Was good enough originally - but plastic parts didn’t hold and now it slides down after a couple of days when I tighten it and falls over. Maybe find a way to keep the screws and the plastic knob from slipping?,3
91757,Quality is good but pretty bulky,3
117219,I got what I paid for. Okay quality. Good for apartment or 1 person.,3
85356,"It is okay, but it's not exactly what I should have ordered.",3
95722,"great product, but as like almost every other brand, their lightest color was still too dark for me",3
88455,My product arrived one was open and it spilled all over the box! :(,3
82238,"Bought to try. Works surprisingly well. Wish it was larger, considering the price.",3
101885,"The collar works, but the prongs must be situated right under the dog's mouth. If it strays even a half inch in either direction, the collar doesn't detect any barking - even on the highest sensitivity level. I have the collar really tight and it still swivels. I'm afraid to make it any tighter. The prongs are already digging into him.",3
97292,It wasn’t as good as I thought it would be. The side doesn’t hold it in real well,3
83966,"Does not last as long as I expected, particularly in the heat! Works well for a couple hours though.",3
90234,it was a little tart..,3
112986,Over priced for what it is.,3
83687,This case was good for the first two weeks until the whole rim around the case came off. I recommend this case if you have a back up case also the case gets lots of scratches.,3
80358,Appearance. Not packaged well honey all over the outside of the package. Product fell out of the cardboard when I picked it up. Seems awfully thin for honey.,3
102300,"It looks nice. But it took so long for shipping, and its corner is broken.",3
102523,This is my second order but this time I got a lot of liquid instead mineral from the container when use. Did anyone have the same experience? Is it a bad batch?,3
86662,"I was bummed he two tracks didn’t fit together. Be aware that here are he light up tracks as well as other normal tracks, but the two do not work together. I prefer the normal tracks over the light up. They’re more pliable and easier to put together.",3
104263,Nice looking case. It fits well on my phone. Not sure how well it will hold up. It’s a little too slippery for me.,3
113634,"Meh. It works, you get what you pay for.",3
113361,"The lock itself is perfect for my needs, but the mounting bracket is a true disappointment. I had to tighten the mounting screw on every ride, and it is absolutely annoying. In this price range this problem should to eliminated. Now i have to use an extra velcro strap to fix the wobble and keep the lock in the desired position.",3
107010,Not the picture shown. The pic was supposed to be vertically oriented ... and a different photo. What I rec’d is an OK pic but I needed a vertically oriented pic for the place I wanted to hang it. Disappointed.,3
92534,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE PRODUCT - NOT THE SELLER. SELLER IS GREAT! This MIGHT be a good product, I purchased it because I thought curcumin would be a good thing to take. However, when I opened the bottle it was SMURF blue! The manufacturer felt the need to add FD&C Blue #1 to the product. First - WHY; and second, if you're adding a DYE, why BLUE? Isn't curcumin orange/yellow? I strongly feel that if it is not necessary to the quality or performance of the product - keep it as pure as possible. I've got to think (and I'll research this) that the DYE is not dangerous, but I question the necessity to add it at all... Not sure if I'm keeping it or not - was just VERY surprised when I opened the bottle!",3
109393,"I'll keep the hat, but it's not what I expected or really wanted. The body of the hat is, indeed, unstructured but the brim is not in the least soft. Instead, it is a stiff material which is sewn in three separate pieces so that the bill can be folded.",3
104505,I thought I ordered it for a IPhone.,3
89520,"If you have to use the extensions, they are worthless. They are so flimsy my puppy had figured he can push hard enough and break through. If you don’t need those it’s perfect .",3
111425,"The construction seems decent, laser works, good ease of use, however I'm not sure how accurate this is. You can turn the bullet a tad and the laser will point slightly differently. It is not perfectly aligned with your barrel, so at 25 yards can be pretty off.",3
109514,"I realize that when you make a forecast you may be wrong,however I watch weather news to see what they think will happen. So far this channel seems very timid in the forecast department. Geez take a chance.",3
107965,This was my 2nd set. Loved the first one so ordered the 2nd one and the first time I put it on the elastic broke on the fitted sheet which sort of bummed me out so be careful.,3
86307,Not very comfortable but does help with pain and stress on shoulder.,3
80472,"Loud. I bought this hoping it would be quieter than my original, but no. I guess noise is just inherent in this type of cooler.",3
119376,Work OK but tend to loosen,3
116281,It didn't stay on...It kept coming off,3
90305,"The suit itself is cute and the color is great. BUT the built in cups are probably big enough for nothing more than a C-cup, unless the underwire is through the middle of the breasts. Very disappointed.",3
93048,This is a nice watch but does have some of the flaws mentioned in other reviews. It's also a bit bulky.,3
105756,Heard repair never work that well,3
106176,Cable to short for crew cab long bed pickups. It's about 4 feet to short to work on our 05 Ford F-350 crew cab long bed. Now i'm trying to band aid a solution. Can't replace as it has the trigger wire for the cam at the dash end and a tap for reverse light at the back end. Shenanigans.,3
100698,"Good product for a quick touchup, not for everyday use.",3
80447,"Product fits my daughter's new tablet perfectly and I love the design. I was a little bummed the case came damaged when there was no damage to the outer packaging. My kiddo is 8 so there's no sending it back and waiting for the replacement. Still, I'm happy with the purchase overall",3
86713,She really liked it.,3
109051,Thicker than expected and the fabric is runny but overall it’s pretty good.,3
81257,A little big for newborns. But good for one year old baby’s or more. Fabric is very soft.,3
81949,Does PQQ help with MEMORY PROBLEMS? I purchased it because I read an article that says it does help memory issues. Not one review on here has mentioned any of the sort. Please advise. Thanks,3
118619,Dress fit ok but was see through and not finished well.,3
115504,Pages were all blank. I expected a general outline for needed information,3
113705,Plastic; sweats on surfaces when filled with drinks and ice.,3
110297,"Very cute, my kids are really enjoying learning to sew with these. This particular brand, however, looses the color on the plastic. This is a problem because you need the color to know where to put your stitches. It rubs off over time making it slightly more difficult to figure out where to put what color. But there are other things I like better than other kits. Like the actual metal needle. Others only come with plastic needles. And the holes on this kit are smaller which, in my opinion, makes the finished product look better.",3
87882,"They are a nice weight and the color is pretty, but the d12 is a bit uneven and the d8 shipped with a small chip. I do wish that they did have the turquoise marbling as shown on the photo.",3
102434,"It's exactly what I excepted it to be. However, I just want to state a suggestion/improvement to the product. It would be nice if you have a quantity of 4 sets of legs. That way you could use an extra set to raise your stand a little higher. So I will have 2 spare plastic platforms and 2 outfitted with all the legs. I needed to raise my monitor just a tad more than what was provided. So, I ordered another one just so I can raise my other stand.",3
94299,Perfect for what we paid and where we are using the product. Will move it into the garage in a year or two and upgrade to something better for where it is at now.,3
91202,They worked well. I liked the fit and look but after 3 months of moderate use they no longer turn on.,3
80731,"I was really disappointed by this stuff. Some reviews said it was great for fine hair, but unfortunately, it made my very fine hair greasy and weighed it down. I’ve used a very small amount and tried it for a few weeks, but it just isn’t working for me. It would probably be ok for semi-fine hair, but my search for a shine and anti-frizz product that works on truly super fine hair continues!",3
101594,This book is designed for a caregiver in a group home setting. Not for someone that is taking care of an elderly parent with dementia. The author has some good points but overall the book did not provide anything I didn’t already know.,3
101442,This was a great idea but fell short of what I wanted and needed. Half and half is available in most places I travel and it tastes so much better. For countries that don’t have half and half this will have to do.,3
116271,"good screen resolution, lightweight. however it sometimes overheats when charging and takes long to charge. the voice unlock is intermittent and face unlock DOES NOT WORK",3
104623,The diffuser bracelet didn't fit. The leather piece could be longer to accommodate a larger bony wrist. The chakra beads are great! A little tight for me but still workable since it's elastic. I would buy again for friends with smaller wrists.,3
107018,My husband spent a little more money on this net than some other choices. But we were disappointed by the quality. It didn’t seem more heavy-weighted netting and the knots nearest to the rim came undone (the net was not installed and I think one of my kids grabbed it but the knots slip out easily) and so we had to re-tied knots). Clearly that is not easily done. We couldn’t figure out the type of knot they used in the first place.,3
97591,"These fit fine/somewhat small, but are made of very thin fabric. They are really more like think tights. Fine only if you plan to wear with a long tunic.",3
106834,"These are for use IN DARK AREAS! I admit, I didn't pay enough attention to the description. The automatic mode works great in low light and dark areas but if there's any significant amount of light in the room they simply won't turn on automatically, and the switch is a bit too difficult to justify constantly turning these on and off. I tried to set these up in the corner of a room that could use a little more light, but these lights would never turn on because there were still ceiling lights in the room and it wasn't quite dark enough to trigger it. I found a good use for them next to the front door so when we enter the house at night it turns on and we don't trip over any pets that might come running to the door. That being said, if you have pets the battery life of these will probably not be as great as you might expect because they will trigger only at night... your mileage may vary.",3
97371,Didn’t like it. Made my hair feel greasy and heavy no matter how much I used. Didn’t give me any type of beach look,3
87038,"Difficult to turn on and off; button is tiny and not easy to reach. Since each control button has more than one function depending on degree of pressure, I have a difficult time navigating with old fingers. I frequently lock it and am unable to unlock. The screen is easy to read",3
87514,I havent used it for it's intention. I tested it and I'm having issues for lack of knowledge. Night vision isn't very clear and the sound is great considering it's size. I'm worried about it now because a friend brought to my attention hacking might give criminals entry into my privacy. Yikes!,3
89560,"It fits a bit big, very comfortable material though!",3
116737,I disliked that the rod was placed way too close to the front so hangers stick out which is a total disaster for the eyes now I have to live with this since I can’t afford another shelf smh,3
114385,To large for my taste also a bit dense,3
112136,"Are these reviews real? Easy to cook in? What are you talking about...this is a faucet, and a lousy one at that. Easy to install, but the photos are incredibly misleading. You need at least 2-3 inches of clearance behind the facuet to put the handle all the way back. Had to install it offset to compensate. Operation is cumbersome, although maybe it's common with these types of designs that make them a pain to rotate freely and reset back into the holder. The 360 degree rotation could be true but good luck not pulling a muscle trying to move it. Could loosen up in time but not going to struggle with it find out. Finish is nice and appears well built, but the functionality is questionable.",3
111593,"I am very unhappy with this Speck case. It is not at all like the other Speck cases I have. Very plastic, bendable feel. I like the ""Speck Products CandyShell Grip Cell Phone Case"" the best and I didn't realize this one was different.",3
83599,Works well and it's light.,3
118549,harsh blueish white LED light. too harsh for makeup,3
112197,Fits beautifully but shows dirt way too easily.,3
89942,"These are very long. I'm 5' 10"" and they sit well above my hip bones. Don't buy if you like low rider type.",3
118399,Fit as expected...i was not happy with the fact thaI it took on the dye from some of my clothes and then would not clean off. I ultimately bought another band and no longer use this one.,3
103441,The outside is attractive and has a beautiful design. The tissues are very cheap and thin.,3
101270,"It jams way too frequently. When it works, the labels look great!",3
86966,Sturdy and very very sharp. Quite heavy for its size.,3
100832,"LED lights are super bright. Not a gentle glow. The bunny is soft and cuddley like a regular stuffed animal. Unfortunately, the glow eats batteries and stop working all together less than a year after purchase.",3
101192,These are quite small and hard to remove the frosting to change them around.,3
110355,Smaller than I thought,3
115851,Bought this chest-strap heart rate transmitter mainly to connect with cardio machines at Planet Fitness but it doesn’t connect with anything. It only seems to work with certain other Garmin products and perhaps a Concept II rowing machine.,3

Other than that the Product seems to be a good quality for coloring your sweets 🙂.",3

96903,"The table is beautiful and very sturdy. Only problem is that the canvas drawers take up knee space, so my (very small) four year old doesn't fit comfortably. We will end up taking the drawers off and coming up with a different solution for Lego storage. Definitely a bummer, but it's a nice table otherwise. Oh and the reversible top is very heavy to flip. I don't mind that, though.",3
96982,I wish I had gotten classic instead of applewood smoked. It is a little too sweet and the flavor profile is vastly less versatile. I got it to add to pulled bbq jackfruit and really can’t imagine using it for anything else besides bbq dishes. The sweetness of it also tastes a little synthetic so all around not too pleased.,3

92793,"Well written book, though content didn't get me as excited as I thought. A huge chunk of the book was on race and gender. I thought it overpowered the book, but I understand this is her reality. For reference, I am a black woman also, so I can relate. Overall, didn't agree with her approach to sex, relationships, and finances in relationships. If anything, the book makes me appreciate how different individuals are, how different our childhood and backgrounds are, and how that shapes us. Still love me some Gabrielle Union :)",3

88584,"Really love the design of these sheets! I've had them for about two months now and some seams are already coming undone, which is a bummer. Wish they were a tad bit softer, but overall I'm still happy with purchase. The print is definitely my favorite part about them.",3

Wasnt able to glue back together with gorilla glue, hot glue might work(i dont have). i ended up just removed the string and the elastic parts and wrapping it around my door knob, going to find a way to put it on a wall or door again. Its pretty high up, my nearly full grown cat has to jump to get it which is good and bad. Better exercise, but will hurt her joints in the long run. Dont get this if you have a small kitten or a super lazy fat cat. I doubt they will jump to play with it, but you CAN modify it and extend the string if you wish to do so.",3

To be fair there are a few which are somewhat strong such as peppermint, spearmint, lemon, and a few others but many are weak or unpleasant. Makes a good set to use by mixing with other, higher quality oils thus creating your own custom scents.",3

115783,"I bought this ac about a month ago and it has been working great until today, the hottest day of the year. I have the ac turned on ac mode and the fan turned up. The hose is installed right, not bent or obstructed. I set the temp down to 70. I cleaned the filters and emptied the water. But ac still only comes on for at most 2 min then there is a thump noise and it turns off leaving only the fan going. Then after about 5 min the ac comes on then turns off again. It's been doing this for the last hour and I don't know what to do. I'm miserable and hot and drenched in sweat. It's 98 degrees out at the moment. I've tried everything I can think of. I thought maybe it has overheated so I turned it off for half an hour but made no difference. I can't afford a new ac already but it's looking like I'm going to have to buy one. I'm updating my review the day after I posted it. As soon as the outdoor temperature started going down the unit was able to stay on for longer periods of time. As soon as it was back in the 80s instead of hovering around 100 I stopped having problems and the unit has worked fine since. I assume it was just to much for it to cool the space it previously had no trouble with once it became dangerously hot out. I don't expect many more days that hot but am going ahead and getting a second unit of some type just in case. I changed my rating from 1 to 3 stars.",3
97629,"I gave this 3 stars because it had everything I needed in a starter kit and the price was fair for that purpose but I was very disappointed. The mat, which I assume would be the most important part of a Yoga package, is extremely light, flimsy, and rolls up at edges no matter which side it is turned on. Also has bad grip and slides around with the slightest movement. Unfortunately, I purchased 2 starter kits right off the bat (1 as a gift) because of the high ratings I saw for this product. I would be able to use the towels and the bag but the mats will have to be replaced.",3
85854,Sizing ran small. The lettering is some kind of heat transfer. Wife ended up giving it away,3

86682,This is just ok. There really is not enough weight to it to keep it securely in place against the bottom of the door. Had I not taken the packaging off I would’ve returned it to find something better.,3

85960,Very nice looking set. Some fading after wash.,3
82456,I purchased this for my dad on his birthday. To be honest the hilt is way too sleek and slippery to be functional. While I recommend the KA-BAR I do not recommend this version for field use. This is more of a show knife to be mounted. Go with the tactical version with an actual grip if you plan on using it.,3
110742,Good beginning for prep. Somewhat repetitive. The links noted were helpful.,3

100097,I ordered these to travel with and ended up when my young grandkids saw them they loved having their drinks of water from them. ( They did colapse too easily) So fascinated with how they can colapse and pull back up. We have not been able to use the largest one because there is a place on the top of the rim where it is jagged therefore not safe to use. I had not checked the whole set thoroughly and the time had passed where it was too late to return back to Amazon. Wish that there was a way to replace the large one.. Thanks.,3

107653,I am not very impressed with this ball. My dog is kind of small to medium and she had problems getting her mouth around it. The squeaker sounds odd and its not very soft like I thought. I think this would be perfect for a larger dog or puppy that likes to chew. Very durable.,3

However, I didn’t give it 5 stars because when I opened the lid to the container, the seal that keeps it moist and contained was already peeled back. A few of them were dried out and a few missing. It was like someone bought these and returned them, but amazon just put them back on the shelf without checking it out!",3
112745,"A 4 TB drive that only shows 3.5 TB should be just that 3.5 TB. No way 500 Gigs should be unusable, that is just plain crazy. But i guess for the Sub $100 price you get what you pay for, can't really complain other than the size. It transfers plenty fast. We shall see how long it lasts.",3

The writing was better than most that I've read lately, but not good enough to merit a higher rating. The story was incomplete, as it is just a teaser for the later books (which I will forego). None of the characters had any depth or feeling to them, and the plot was confused and incomplete. There may be some interesting ideas here, but without the other two books there is no way to tell.",3
109245,Gives a slight glimmer that only shows when you move into the light. The lip gloss is more gloss than glimmer. There isn't enough glitter per gel for the lip gloss so it just looks like you out on any old lip gloss.,3

86233,"Great idea and the gradual introduction works well. There are two reasons why I took off stars: 1) makes everything taste like peanuts so it’s hard to mix with solids, unless you’re only feeding things that go with peanut butter. 2) Needs to be used for a long time - they recommend 6 months.

115977,I read the reviews before ordering and still had high hopes. The color is nice. I didn’t like where the v-neck sits and even in the right size it doesn’t look as shapely with the belt as I expected. I tried. If it can work for you I think it would be great with pencil skirts.,3
86280,These worked for the time I needed them but I don't like the material. The material pills and runs very easily.,3

92330,Works fine as a pacifier but ours don't glow all night long. The only way I see it glowing like it is in the photo is if you put it near a black light for a few hours or leave it out on a sunny day. Otherwise it is very faint. We got this more for the glowing aspect but I got rid of my black lights in the 90's. Also the sun doesn't shine on our house because of the swarm of giant eagles flying around looking for Gandalf.,3

82499,"So here is an honest review: 1. They are beautiful looking headphones that are made of great quality. If you only want to 'look' at your headphones...buy these now! 2. The sound (which is most important) underperformed. I have a pair of $40 Ausdom bluetooth headphone that sounds waaaay better from mid-high and especially lows. 3. The bluetooth kept disconnecting on ALL of my devices. This never happened with my cheap ones. 4. I believe like another reviewer mentioned...they are ear heavy. This part didn't bother me too much, as they were still fairly comfortable and not too tight. However, somehow there is an imbalance with the weight of the top part (that goes over your head) because with even doing light activities while wearing them they would start to fall off. Again, my cheapies never had this problem and I've had them for over a year. 5. No bag, case or really any extras besides the charging usb cord and aux cord for when you're not using the bluetooth. This would've been perfectly fine if the main purpose was fulfilled (""the sound""). 6. All in all, I loved the name of the headphones (which did influence my purchase) and the look. Using real leather is something that is usually on more expensive headphones. But because these are headphones, not a handbag they still need to sound great too. It's like a beautiful woman with no personality or a bad attitude...not worth the headache. 7. Perhaps an updated version would greatly suit this product and I would remain optimistic in giving them a second chance.",3

What usually would be a fairly simple 20 min. assembly turned into a two hour long struggle trying to force screws into holes that are literally drilled at varying angles and degrees. I gave it three stars for being as comfortable as any comparably priced computer chair and negative two stars for being the most awful thing I have ever had the displeasure of assembling.,3
102935,Shipped in a box that was to big. Book got banged around. Pages are bent and covers scratched. Should have used a much smaller box.,3
103679,I wish I had ordered the larger model This side kick is hard to hold onto to me,3
113061,I loved these but they were too small for my newborn which was strange because she has a small head. Had to return but I really liked them and they seemes to be good quality,3
94209,I like the guitar however it did not come with the stickers for the cords or silver rings. Dissapointing- hopefully the seller will send ones over.,3
86053,"The size was a lot bigger than I anticipated. It's more so for a ""Big & Tall"" person. Not bad though.",3
88079,"You can't tell much about the book other than it's a pocket book. I was expecting a whole lot more. It's content is wonderful, but it's big print and like it says, it's only 40 prayers. The entire contents of the 40 prayers and the substance of the book could have been printed on 10 pages. There isn't much here. I expected more. Content is ""A+"", but quantity of material is a ""D"".",3
110341,"Lots of things to like, but the mug didn't work for me because the handle slips too easily for my situation. Can't fault anything else.",3
87097,"When I bought this, touch screen compatibility was one of the main decision factors. Unfortunately, that's the only thing these gloves don't do. It is a shame because they are quite well made but I was never able to use any device with a touch screen while wearing them.",3
100471,"I've been searching for studs that I can wear to bed. These had great ratings, so I gave them a try. They are good for day to day use, but left my ears very swollen after sleeping with them in.",3
81320,This took over a month to get here. The direction to assemble it are pour. The product was bent and was difficult to put together. The motor made a horrible noise when we turned it on and we had to take apart the motor case a fix the motor before it would work...don’t buy from this company. I a betting it won’t last a year.,3
107874,I ordered a large because I wear a large but this item was made smaller than the United States sizing,3
93222,A little bit more cheaply made than they look in the pictures. They are hard to flatten out/uncurl.,3
119703,"At XXXL, this shirt is not meant to be worn by heavy set people. In fairness though, it is very good quality, but unfortunately too form fitting for me.",3
81373,Very cheaply made broke within 2 weeks,3
102406,"I bought this product twice. The first set was awesome. It worked well and helped reduce the swelling/puffiness under my eyes when I used the product. But, the second set that I bought made my skin irritated. I have used three pairs of the eye gels from the second set, and each time my skin becomes red, splotchy, and irritated. It feels fine when the gel is on, but once I take it off the skin becomes inflamed and uncomfortable. I really wanted to be able to use this product a lot more, but its just not worth the skin irritation. I have sensitive skin, so maybe its just a problem for people with skin like mine.",3
112601,Love the quality and the pocket for staying organized but had to use sharpie in order to see what I wrote on the tabs so unable to erase and reuse.,3
112513,"The description says Intensity Level 6, Package says 4..",3
91365,No comment at this time,3
101907,The flavors are decent but the product breaks and leaks easily. Also ended up finding it at a 99Cent store only recently for cheaper.,3
111657,"Have had over a year. Wears well, but colors fade quickly though.",3
87176,rusted out after a few months,3
114054,Heat seems minimal but works well if add a light . The reason I’m giving it a 3 is that the vents (2 on the side; 1 on top) do not snap in correctly- I feared breaking the lid if I pushed too hard. It’s like the lid is made of like a salad container material... not too sturdy but not flimsy.,3
108201,"The product is awesome....BUT....when you receive them, they are very hard to untangle all 50 of them. It took me almost 1 hour to individually separate them. Owner of product: It might be easier to batch them in multiples of 10 instead of 50. Super difficult to untangle all of them. Also, when placing the hook on the badge, some of them were super hard to push in place. 2 so far were defective.",3
83662,I prefer target brand or Costco brand over these,3
117137,The overall function works. It's easy to adjust the angle of the chair. It's also easy to get it upside-down which is easily noticed by the comfort of the chair. For long time use it's not the most comfortable thing to sit on.,3
80222,If your headlights have almost any curvature to them I would recommend not wasting your time or money on this product because it gets a bunch of crinkles in it that are virtually impossible to get out of it is however exactly as described and works exactly as described,3
106116,"My husband was diagnosed with high blood pressure so I thought this would be a good thing to have on hand. Which it worked great when I tested it on myself, it did not work too great for my husband. The cuff is too small if you have any kind of large muscles in your arms.",3
116210,"I bought this case for extra protection on the camera. Definitely protects it. It’s cute, light weight. However, it doesn’t take drops well... even on carpet. Dropped the case on accident and the front pumper dosent really attach at the top or bottom and was pushed into my glass screen protector and cause it to pop off in the corner.",3
115470,The color blue rubbed off with the contact of the water and stained my clothes. :-(,3
90735,"I received the 5 pack of filters and noticed that the filter beads were loose in the packaging. I don't know if its me, but I am not able to find anywhere to message the company directly. The lack of customer service is frustrating, and that is why I have rated it 3/5 stars.",3
81573,"Didnt realize how small, returning",3
90310,The story is a very powerful one as it is based on actual events. And it is somewhat thought provoking after the movie if one chooses to ask how this event unfold as it did. I watched the extended 4K version of the movie. It also comes with a theatrical 4K version as well as a standard Blu-ray and digital coupon. On the technical side I absolutely loved the far better than average audio effects. Great use of overheads for those with a Dolby Atmos or near equivalent system. The ground floor effects are also quite above average. The video does have some grain but the movie was not shot in 4K so not should be expected. But there were a couple things that caused me not to rate this movie as a 5. The biggest problem I have is there were times when the video and audio lost sync. To correct this I had to reload the disc. This very much interrupted the flow of the movie. Perhaps the theatrical version does not have this issue. As I am using an OPPO 203 and have not had this experience with any other video I strongly feel the issue came from the disc. I hope this is unique to just my disc and doesn't affect others. But be aware. In the end I don't regret purchasing the movie and would urge others to buy it. I hope the DVD manufacturers utilize better quality control in the future.,3
