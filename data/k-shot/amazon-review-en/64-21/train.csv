127855,Makes greAt coffee but coffeemaker does not allow your hand to get into that coffee pot to clean it; therefore coffee residue stays in bottom of pot. I like the attachment that removes chlorine from the Warne. Auto brew timer is a great feature.,4
152307,It's everything it says it is.... Works perfect for us!!!!,4
120267,"Well in the picture it says it has 2 vibrators when it really has only one. Other than that it's light and very versatile, I use it for my herniated disc and my epicondylitis and it's great that it's wireless cos I can take it with me to trips and restaurants and stuff. I just think the publicity has to be more accurate. It wouldn't hurt if it really had 2 vibrating points, and better yet, that not only the middle part vibrated but all 3 sections we're functional. Just an idea for Homedics.",4
130126,I like this book. Glad Rebecca and Alex realized that they love one another. Sad that Heather had such hate for Rebecca that she would hurt people,4
156282,This pot is on point. Very good. No sticking.very easy to clean and cooks perfectly fine,4
133660,"These fit well and are very comfortable but are rather frail. Best hand washed or, as last resort, washed on delicate/cold water in the washing machine. Do not dry in the clothes drier if that can be avoided.",4
157316,"Not really a blue light at night, more like a yellow white light. Still, it's better than nothing.",4
141204,"I was skeptical but my better half ordered two of these. We made use of the suggestions from other people who bought these and gave them a good review. Very sturdy. We put them together with the addition of gorilla glue on the pegs. We assembled them and let them sit overnight to let the adhesives dry and do their job. The cranky comments from people who didn't follow the instructions, moving the item right after assembly, not assembling them properly, etc. are tiresome. This is not heirloom furniture but it does the job if you put it together properly.",4
153551,Love the look of this costume. My daughter loves it - good for twirling! :) Only complain is cheapness of accessories - the gems on the wand fell off after 5 minutes of trying it on. Hopefully we can glue them back on.,4
153131,It is beautiful but it slide off the table a lot.,4
141379,Basement humidity is much better using this,4
147747,My daughter got this book for Christmas. It is great to be given so many ideas of things to draw. I just wish there was some sort of instruction or a picture to copy. It is literally an empty book.,4
144727,"Nice looking, appears to be well-made. Not as lightweight as I would have hoped, but perhaps it can't serve its purpose at a light weight. The tightening screws, handles, etc., are sturdy, and legs are stable. Will work well.",4
136619,"But the metal join on one side has a small snag. It isn't enough to stop me from using them, but it is noticeable as I knit. Otherwise they're great, and I like the finish on the needles--not so slick my work slides off but smooth.",4
140855,"Thought that I would stand upright for the most part, but it kind of folds over when it is full. It is durable and lightweight for taking to the laundromat",4
128778,"as advertised, loved it",4
128391,This game is a lot of fun.,4
148765,I also bought the solar ones--love it. My advice is to get the solar and not worry about batteries,4
150547,As noted in at least one other review product arrived with no top. When I have purchased this product in a pet store it has always had a top on it. This is my favorite aroma of the other colognes in this product line; last only a day or so which is disappointing.,4
124668,Love it and results!! Only thing is it was pretty messy,4
137341,Bras are very comfortable. Perfect for breastfeeding.,4
137402,"Fast-paced romance with a little magic thrown in for good measure. Not an intensely deep story, but still a fun read.",4

120130,I love these glasses. Very good quality and they look great on me. I'm happy.,4
131492,"The window of time to return this product was one month. Although the product broke one week after that return window closed, the merchant was very responsive and was able to rectify the situation by replacing the product. I’m very impressed with their professionalism and responsiveness to the matter. They are definitely customer oriented.",4
159639,"They're a little looser than I was expecting but I think I'm just in between sizes (xs and small). Overall, length is great.",4
138131,"Loving it so far, although I do feel the suction isn’t perfect but enough to do the job.",4

120335,Very cute! Fits the note 9 well.,4

138976,Is good quality for a great price.,4
140632,"Sleeve offers great compression, really helps my tendonitis. Gave 4 stars because the copper healthy emblem and print started wearing off on 2nd days and looked really bad. After a few days was worn enough to peel the rest. Other than that I highly recommend.",4
147442,Great item. Price is right! Just exactly what I needed!!! Super cute,4
130874,Adult wipes. Larger than those purchased in 99 cent store,4
139913,Was pretty good and solid. The phone didn't work out for me so replaced it.,4
126197,Top is a little big while bottoms are a little small but still super cute.,4
141460,"Beautiful dress, just did not fit",4
151287,"I got a defective unit, but manufacturer was quick to replace it! Great for charging my Apple Watch on the go.",4
144299,"How can I replace LED, I bought this item and the light only worked for about 2 month?",4
152763,The controller functions well overall. the only negatives are that the dpad is nearly unusable and that the rubber pad on the left stick wears over time.,4
148564,"I think these are a great value if you are looking for something cute. You get a variety of cute patterns for a fantastic price, and I definitely think they are worth buying. They are made out of a soft knit cotton t-shirt like material which is just what I wanted. Just know if you want to use these to workout or just casually wear them for a long time that you may have to readjust them as they like to slip back and then off in those instances, at least on my hair which is really sleek. I also have a medium-large head so that probably plays a part. It's definitely not a deal-breaker and I am sure once I wear them more they will stretch out a bit.",4
122279,I like the magnetic capability. I wish the product came in colors. I will have to paint it and hope that it will still be durable.,4
133981,"Kind of expensive for boxes but they are good quality and shipped faster than expected. There aren’t a lot of options in this size, I recommend these!",4
140536,For indoor use only . Gravel collects around foot too much to be useful outdoors in the Desert. Insole becomes a little sticky after a few hours. Wool insole lining would be better.,4
120299,has all that is needed,4
120440,"Likes: great design, well built. Dislike: I have a tendency to want to lean slightly on the table but am afraid to with the 20 pound capacity.",4
136634,Had hubby install this weekend. Now both sides of garage roof are set to collect rain water this afternoon.,4
138637,Yes the price is steep for a print - but it is the perfect addition to our apartment.,4
155686,Good thickness to the pages but the coloring pages aren't very interesting.,4
130060,"It was cool for about 2 minutes, and then I just didn't see the draw to these. Also, if you have a wireless charger, they tend to get in the way. My wife uses them still, well, until I bought her a new case she can't use them on.",4
154537,It was a gift for my husband. He likes the color and it's very nice. Magnet isn't very strong but it holds about 10-12 bills,4
158117,"I love the ideal of stretchable lids. It goes well on pyrex glass boxes. Just make sure it is of perfect size. dishwasher safe. Do not leak but don't store liquid in container and then hope it to replace your lid. About the zip seal bags, they are ok not that great but fact that it is re-usable I have lot of use cases for organizing my fridge with them.",4
130784,"Looks nice and is good sized. However, the holder for the wipes has already ripped after 2 months of use and when you put a small stack of wipes, it does not close. The closing strap needs to be long and the magnet needs to be stronger.",4
143442,It only worked for about 3 months and stopped working,4
124522,A bit large for a size 8. But it shines so nice!! Looks great. It’s a tad brighter and lighter than my real diamonds but perhaps with wear it’ll settle in. Looks great with my real diamonds! Love it.,4
158467,"I’m 5’5 and bought a Large. Pros: the price, lightweight fabric, very breathable. Cons: top is pretty thin shows bra, stripes are more like a bright red, and the sleeve length is a little too long for me. Mine did come with the belt and pockets.",4
151715,"My end table is metal, so the magnet works great, especially when my wife goes to sleep and I have to turn off my bedside lamp. Yet to be used for work projects.",4
125100,We got these for our living room table. They go well with our decor and they are great for the price (added bonus that it comes with a holder). Bottomline - they do the job while looking great,4
140771,"This rug pad is a good value for the money. Product was as represented and advertised. I would order a thicker size next time--but that was my issue, I got what I ordered and recommend.",4
155054,"There are pros and cons to this product. Pros: it works well; I can see my kids while they sleep; the monitor let's me know when it needs to charge; I like that there is a music button, with the VOX setting, the screen turns off when kids are quiet which preserves battery life; it gives us the option to mount to the wall with 2 holes on the back; it does not connect to WiFi which prevents hackers, so keeps my kids safe; it has volume controls and I can talk to my kids through the monitor which is great when I see them doing something they should not; the monitor for my kids room can twist different ways which is great when mounting. Cons: the screen is small; picture quality is not so great; because of the piece that stands the parent up and the charging cable, it can be awkward to stand up; the volume is not very loud; even though it's given the option to mount, no screws come with it to mount; the speaker control is not great and sometimes my kids can't hear me through it; it only sometimes beeps when the kids monitor gets unplugged. I've given it a 4 because for the most part it does it's job and it's good for what I need it for and that is to be a second monitor to the one of a different brand that I already have. It's not as good as my other one, but it works.",4
6468,Not great as hair gets tangled in brush. And this with short hair,1
14064,I normally wear a 2xl got the Xl I could have gotten the large very thin material Fix's like a maternity top,1

35994,"seriously. it was so hard to open my arms hurt and hour later. I can lift a 20 lb bag of cat food (not that I do it often, but it's possible for me to do without issue). in comparison, this was a nightmare. I'm using it as a grow light, not for a workshop, so I have no experience with work lights. So the word clamp has specific connotations... They DO NOT INCLUDE, that they must be twisted TOGETHER TO close. It's not like a hair clip, like a regular clamp. I figured id attach it to the shelf above to keep it upright by CLAMPING it on.. You know, like a CLAMP. YOU CAN'T. it needs to hang from a pole. a freaking pole. it's basically the equivalent of a stronger twist tie that will supply power to a bulb. it's cheap - in price, looks and construction. So the only people who will be able to find this useable are those very strong, with freaking POLES!",1
27746,Says it was delivered and I never received it. Unsure of how to contact seller,1
37654,Had to constantly change battery. Worked sometimes,1
15250,"This is the worst scale I've ever owned. I can step on the scale without clothes and then again fully clothed and weigh the exact same thing. It's almost like this scale remembers your last weight and if it's close, just displays the same thing over and over. Other scales I've had in the past are so accurate that you can literally see an ounce difference when you add or remove weight. DO NOT buy this thing if you are weighing in daily or keeping close track of your weight. All it is good for is a generalized number and is definitely not accurate!",1

32096,"The main point I want to make is that the camera works as expected, unfortunately as soon as summer came along the body could not stand the heat and warped so that it no longer will stay in the mount. I live in southern CA and it isn't really that hot. I think that anyone using this camera in Phoenix would likely have a puddle on their dash after leaving the car closed up all day in the AZ heat.

119023,"I cannot decide if I like them or dislike them... As someone who is fairly comfortable with putting false lashes on with lash glue, I find these extremely difficult to put on. The length of the magnet is fairly short. Once I was able to adhere the magnets, I was shocked at how comfortable they were on. However, because the length of the magnet is so short, the lashes look like they were hanging on for dear life. It's like when you wear false lashes and one of the corners doesn't stay on so you have that lash peeking out. I may have to cut them, but I think they will end up looking like corner lashes instead of full lashes. I think with better practice, this may work out for me BUT it might take more magnetic lashes since you have to be extremely gentle with them or else they start to fray/peel off the band and lose its original form. Also, to clarify, you get 8 pieces but they're only 2 pairs of magnetic lashes (2 pieces for each eye), not 8 pairs of magnetic lashes.",3

82725,I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because the actual ball entertained the puppy for a bit. The battery life on this thing isnt good. The weasel part came off day one and my Moms dog weighs 3 lbs. Def not a good buy for any dog.,3
108222,The toys were low quality,3
87568,Liked the doing things that you never thought of doing before and getting out of your comfort zone. Might make some people be inspired to do the same.,3
91090,Couldn't keep. The red is not red at all. Pink with shiny straps. Ordered for a boy. Definitely will not work.,3

103555,"I wanted to wait a little while before doing a review. First off, it's not Vegan (not a big deal to me, but to some it is very important so just want to point that out). It also is greasy in my eyes, and that greasy coating helps the tattoo pop and become vibrant while it absorbs into the skin. Overall, it's ok. I'll move on after this tin and try other products out there.",3

104583,"but then it fell oddly flat. Sorry, I feel terrible saying this but I LOVE the story, LOVE the characters but there was just something missing. Some of the scenes went to much into detail and took away from the excitement happening while others just flew over like they couldn’t be done quick enough. Not sure I want to risk the next book for $4.99 🌸",3
89643,Love it. BUT fell apart after just s couple months. Poor quality.,3
110599,"I purchased this mat because of all the positive reviews and the design on the mat. I have been using it for over two weeks and it still has a bump where it was folded during shipping. It does catch some of the litter but not as much as I'd like. I'm still having to clean up litter daily. Maybe it is because the holes to catch the litter are fairly small? I use Tidy Cats. After all the positive reviews, I was expecting this mat to be the answer to the litter mess but unfortunately, it is NOT.",3
113917,"I love how this little looks like it's for humans but can be used to help your dog. I like how you can hold it by the loop. That's nice! I don't know if I'm doing it wrong, but the black water pouch is just WAY too short. My dogs lick the water nozzle because it takes up like 1/2 of the space in the pouch. If you have a Chihuahua or Yorkie this would be good. But any dog over 15 it 20lbs it's waaay too short for.",3
119314,"A little brittle and could be saltier (for my taste), but still decent. You could probably get something that tastes better and maybe cheaper at a local Asian market. But if you must order seaweed on Amazon this does the job.",3

119356,"I have mixed feelings about Click Date Review, and they lean more towards the negative. I enjoyed the premise, but I felt like the execution could have been more entertaining. INstead it was just depressing. I also didn’t really like any of the characters, and the ending of the book felt pretty rushed. The overall pacing was also a bit off. I did like the very end, though. It just felt slightly forced, I guess. The book overall was not great, and I wouldn’t recommend it for people who want fun drama, rather than depressing drama. 2.5 stars.",3
116811,"We adored these lanterns at our winter party. They were a huge hit for all ages. When they arrived, they turned out to be HUGE. Just took several minutes to get off the ground, but flew beautifully afterwards. Will but again, for sure.",3

81862,"This little vacuum is a good value. The main attachment is good for cleaning up pet hair or crumbs--there's suction on the top and bottom so it's great to stick in corners or behind couch cushions, etc. I keep it in my car to vacuum the seats and other nooks and crannies. But it's not the best on flat/hard surfaces. It's also not the best at getting dust if you don't attach the hose. The exhaust on the sides it really intense and might blow the dust away before you have a chance to vacuum it up. Also, if you don't empty the canister after every use or keep it upright, the dirt/hair/dust can just fall right out again. Finally, it's very loud. But for the price, it gets the job done and I'm pretty happy with it.",3
110821,"I greatly enjoyed these contemporary uptake on classic fairytales. the only reason I gave them a lower rating is because I'm always looking for christian books with LOTS of faith, hope & healing. books that really keep my eyes on God & the christian life.",3
86426,"4 stars for the value, 2 stars for the quality. If I let my brother printer sit long enough to cool... the first page of the next print job is smudged beyond use.

193078,love these greeting cards! they're small but adorable. will definitely be buying again.,5
166523,I buy it for my granddaughter to do crafts with. She like the tapes and sticks it on everything. She uses the tapes to decorate her iPhone 6s which with a clear case gives it a one of a kind look. With this pack it gives you 40 different tapes and she loves them all. She put them all in a ziploc bag and has been toting them around like a long lost treasure. This is the second set I have ordered and there will be more orders in the future!

163751,The best moisturizer for my face and neck. Also use it on hands and arms as a moisturizer and ski. Softener. I have been using this product for years and it is the reason I have minimal wrinkles for being 84 years old.,5
192343,I was so pleasantly surprised with my husband's pick of this cap for me. Even the description makes it sound fun as it is. Good for a young or older person as I can attest to. The grey color universal and the tweed gives it character. Exceptionally soft but holds it shape and perfect over any hairstyle.,5
191382,These work well on dry eyes. Just use them before going to bed.,5
179846,These little eggs work wonders for potty training a stubborn toddler!,5

177119,"I have to wear steel toed shoes and I hate always have to tying my shoes. I found these no tie shoelaces and watched the instructional video and figured these would suit me just fine. So when I received my pair (mind you it comes is a very cute package), I reviewed the video again as I didn't want to mess it up. The instructional video is SO helpful and so easy to follow. I am on my feet all day and these laces are fabulous. They stay in place and are comfortable. I never have to worry about laces coming undone. These are a must have!

166894,Loved these items!! Party Jell-O shots is always a hit!!!,5
168417,this is by far the best apple watch protector. I really need it and it keeps my watch safe and I like the way it looks!,5
163880,I like it. I use it for the gym and travel. Small enough to fit a small duffel bag. Big enough to fit regular size bottle of shampoo and conditioner with plenty of room to spare.,5
183316,very easy to install and set up great picture grid line great I would recommend as great setup for the price,5
174932,Great price! Great fit for both me and my son! Going to buy another pair since my son ended up loving mine so much.,5

162289,This is a life saving book for gastric stage one and two patients. This book is the ideal book for somebody who is thinking about the gastric sleeve technique.

188120,"This toothpaste is pretty great! I must say at first I was a little hesitant using a black toothpaste. I have been wanting to try activated charcoal and this seemed like the perfect option. Less chemicals than normal toothpastes and has probiotics for healthier teeth! For me personally, I like extreme minty feeling after brushing, this does not leave that however, I have noticed a remarkable difference in how my mouth tastes when I wake up! So while the initial feeling is not as minty, I have better breath after extended times. Does not foam like your typical toothpaste however, you brush in the same way! Excited to see extended results!",5

I hate to give nice glasses a low rating...it's the shipping that lacks.",2
62893,"These did not work out for me at all. I wear a Women's size 10 medium and these were too small and cramped my toes. The fabric made my feet feel very hot too. I did like how they don't slip around your foot though. Because they were too small for a Women's 10, I returned them.",2
79853,For the price I figured they wouldn’t be as good as the more expensive ones but they are made of extremely thin sheet metal. Have a 1-2” gap around them and do not even include rubber for the edges just a foam round foam sticky pad for the bottom corner. If you aren’t looking for quality or a tight fitting door then these are for you! If you want something that actually seals up the lowers then purchase a different product,2
47356,"These wipers clear the windshield well but are very noisy, will not buy again.",2
47801,"Probably dont get this if you need a protector because you drop your phone frequently. I dropped my phone and the entire protector just popped off (because it attaches around the circumference of the screen, unmentioned in the product description) and the entire right side of my screen is all cracked now. Probably fine if you just want to protect your screen from scratches? I guess.... Wishing their ""Lifetime Replacement Warranty"" worked to replace my phone. Also, this thing definitely is not smudge resistant, which isn't important to me, but worth mentioning.",2

74486,The cover is pretty. But I've had it in my purse for a few weeks and it's not in a high traffic pocket and the binding is already coming undone. If I used it every day I could see that be justified but I don't.,2

57524,you get what you pay for,2
45348,The product is very miss leading of the size they are nowhere near what it looks like in the picture. Definitely read the description the pieces were no long that 16 inches and less than a 1/2 inch thick. Better for a small 10 gallon,2

75651,They are soggy after toasting. I tried to fix that by adding more time to the toasting but they just came out dry and difficult to eat. They also fall apart while trying to eat them. You'll need a spoon... I can get better waffles.,2
54732,"Pillow Cover slick and not a typical pillow material. Would NOT recommend. The REAL Better Homes and Garden pillow from Walmart that has insert included and not just a cover has a cost of $2.00 more and is worth the money, NOT this pillow COVER. DO NOT RECOMMEND this seller's pillow cover at all.",2
45813,Silicon portion does not quite fit and I'm very disappointed that you cant put the phone in the holster with the screen facing out. The picture shows the holster being used as a kickstand but you can't actually do that because the phone wont lock in screen facing out. Also I bought two of these in different colors and they are not even close to the same case.,2

Guess the name Peugeot doesn't mean what we thought it did. It is very difficult to select the grind, and it doesn't come out when you do get it there.You cannot fill it very full. Junk for $42.",2
61163,Fable 2 Heavy and too hard to get on I did not care for them at all the material was so thick too heavy for me!,2
65545,I loved the pattern but they were way shorter then the cheaper compression socks I ordered. I was really disappointed and will not be ordering from them again.,2

67944,"The Rapid Remover Vinyl Letter Remover does not not remove vinyl letters. I tried it on several types of decals and letters over a period of a few days. I let it soak per directions, longer than required and shorter periods. It does not remove the letters even with a lot of scraping. I removed the letters with a heat gun. The adhesive left behind did come off with the product. Very disappointed. Not worth the high price. Would not recommend for vinyl letter removal.",2

However, less than two years after purchasing, heavy use with my Ryobi brushless trimmer caused the batteries to overheat and the area around the contacts melted. Almost ruined my trimmer, as one of the batteries almost wouldn't come out. Neither are currently functional. I have purchased 4 of these, as I gave two to my son-in-law as a gift. I also own some of the actual Ryobi batteries which I have owned for years, and have had no problem. I can't recommend Energup at this point, unless you are only doing light-duty stuff.",2

58578,"If I had written this review when I first bought the headphones it would be an all 5 star review. These headphones sound and work great. That being said now that I’ve had them for some time and haven’t really used them very hard. Just mainly a few hours a week. The battery life has dropped pretty low, I’m lucky if I get two hours out of them and it takes a long time to charge them back to full. A lot of times I use one headphone at work and when the battery dies now I basically can’t use it again the same work day.",2
