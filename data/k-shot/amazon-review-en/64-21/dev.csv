130688,"The stylus worked great for a few days. However, now when I try to use it, it does not work. I've only had it for about a week now, and I've only used it about 3 times during school. The buttons on the stylus also do not work. I do see that sometimes the stylus will work for a few seconds while I have my palm rested on the iPad but it stops working once I take my palm off. This only lasts for a few seconds even while keeping my palm on the screen. It also will not connect to my iPad anymore. The stylus is not recognized anymore when I try to pair it to my iPad. It was such a great product at first, so I don't see how it is not working anymore. Update: I contacted the seller regarding a refund and I was granted one with no hassle. I’ve had the new one for months now and it works great!",4

129009,"These diapers are adorable, and are a great price compared to others. After doing some research, these have been highly rated for durability. I unfortunately have not had the chance to use these yet, as they are way to big for my 7 lb newborn. We are using disposable diapers until he can fit in these, which is a little disappointing as we were hoping to avoid disposables this time around, but it's not the end of the world. I have given this 4 stars because I haven't been able to actually try them out due to the fact they do not fit newborns as advertised. Due to the size of these diapers, I anticipate we won't get to use them for at least another few months. I will update my review when we get a chance to use them.",4

121967,"I buy this tea for my father-in-law who is more of a coffee drinker and isn't fussy about tea. I personally find it fairly harsh and not a soothing beverage. Organic teas that cost more tend to have a better flavor and go down better, even black. Still for the price, it's not bad.",4

132762,"When I purchased this I didn’t see the disclaimer about it not fitting some coffee makers. I have a Bunn and the filter is too small. However, I decided to try it anyway and so far it’s working just fine. I hardly ever make a full pot, so the grounds don’t over flow and there is very little sediment in the bottom of the pot.

155525,Great product with fast delivery!,4
142571,Using to feed a beta with the small round beta pellets. Tested it out before installing on the tank. Works good on 24 and 12 hour feeding. Pellet food is very small and it was a little tricky to adjust food release. Instructions are in Chinese none in English. If I didn’t have something like this before I would have been in trouble. It is still new so we will have to see how it performs in future,4
141875,This is the second set of these I've had..and the motor has quit in one of them each time. Guess I will have to send these back too. So disappointed. Edited to add: I am going to change this to a 4 star as the seller has contacted me with an offer of a refund and replacement product. This kind of offer goes a long way with me and hopefully the new set works well.,4
158053,"This is to replace a similar product which I lost, and it appears to be equally waterproof.Tried the leak test seems to look good slight condensation around the edge at the top but I'm sure that will be ok as tissue inside was bone dry.Using for a holiday looks sturdy thanks.Tested these whilst in the garden pool and they worked brilliantly..",4
127951,Love it! Looks great and holds flower pot well just wish they had a little more room between bottom and top shelves.,4
147202,A long book but reads quickly. Writing is clear. Naval action tied to its effect on and participation in the land war. A good introduction to the naval history of the era. More photos would have welcome. Maps are clear but in tiny print in this edition. An accompanying atlas of WWII naval battles would help the reader understand maneuvers and strategy. Recommended.,4

123222,"These socks provide great compression. They do the job and my feet/legs feel great after the end of a 12hr shift. They are thick near the foot which provides great cushion. I have 2 complaints. 1) the foot/toe part of the socks are very wide. Which can make it difficult to fit into well-fitting tennis shoes. 2) The band are the top can be very tight. I end up having to roll it down by the ned of the day. Overall, great compression. Wide toes. Thick sock with cushion",4
150876,Product has potential to be a five star product. The only issue was the stitching along the main zipper started coming off immediately after the first use. Overall satisfied.,4
145700,"The ""but"" here is because I should have ordered the wider banded one made by the same excellent company. The thin band put a little too much pressure on my waist. I love this company, though. I own about 5 different leggings that they make.",4

I used to need to wrap a large bungee cord around the bike in a couple spots to keep my covers from being blown off the bike, specially in storms, this one has held strong for a couple weeks now without any current signs of breaking. this is a CHEAP cover however, don't hold high expectations for longevity of the cover. it's not super thick and will break if continued to be used as I am currently using it!",4
154261,"This works well to help organize cosmetics and jewelry, particularly given limited storage space in the bathroom. It appears to be well made and is easy to stack, although the drawers can be a tad sticky. I am using the bottom three tiers on my dresser, to store jewelry, and the top levels in the bathroom, to store cosmetics. I like the versatility that you can separate the pieces and stack them as necessary Why four stars instead of five? I wish it were a little larger, and I wish that there were deeper compartments on the top for storing brushes and pencil eye and lip liners.",4
138653,"The antennas work good, once you get them installed and set up your TV to scan channels the video is good. Depending where you have it set up, the picture quality and/or channel availability will have an impact on what is available for reception. By extending them to the maximum height or on/by the windows is even better for viewing your maximum channels that are available in your area. Does the job and the price is good as well.",4
127123,Good seller. Would do business with again.,4
146245,I love the diamond picture. Some of the symbols are really hard to make out( an example is a white symbol on a light gray background). There are 3 different ones in this picture. I am having to use a magnifying glass. Plus all the colors are really close in color. It is going to be spectacular..I was short some beads in one color and the seller was very quick to respond.,4
134130,"What I really enjoy about this duvet cover is how soft the material is and the comfort you get when you touch it. I've had some duvet covers that are simply not good, they are all crunchy and sleeping under them is a nightmare.

39324,In my quest to find the best electric razor I read some reviews and bought this. I loved it at first and had a pretty close shave but the plastic it’s made out of is cheap and the head would come off when using it. It does hold a charge for a very long time.

In addition, the picture quality is not very good and finally went out in less than 8 months. It’s not weather resistant as moisture easily gets in between the connections. Last but not least, I ran the cable 90 degrees and over 12 inches away from power switch. The EMI had a direct effect on the already horrible picture quality. Found a better, thicker, and more shielded cable for less money on Amazon! DO NOT BUY!",1

I ended up just setting it to night only just to keep it from constantly switching back and forth. Inside I just need it to see if baby is asleep and ok.

He felt so bad he didn't even charge me, but he recommended a local watch shop about a mile away. I went there - and he, too, couldn't get the back on the watch. I went to a THIRD watch shop - same story. Then, in desperation, I emailed Timex who said I'd hear from someone within 24 hours - that was almost three days ago. So that's it - I'm done.

108226,Holds everything but is quite long,3
92016,"I don’t want to review the actual product, just wanted to warn others to beware of the size. It is much larger than I expected. I will have to decide what to do with them.",3
89455,a little stiff but does the job,3
90321,"Well done movie. The actual story was great, I don't know why there had to be so many changes and embellishments to this movie.",3
99355,"Although this makes putting jewelry on easier, I would not recommend these for valuable, expensive jewelry. The magnets are just not strong enough. The slightest tug and apart they came!",3
94393,"The diapers seem well-made. However, I apparently chose the wrong size. I have a fourteen year old dachshund and the diapers will tape shut snugly but are so short on her rump that they just pretty much slide off. Haven’t worked for me, and not sure I will gamble another $20 or so to try a larger size.",3
87241,Somehow I did not grasp they were paper.,3
85966,I use this to monitor my doors and windows. Motion sensor does not always detect movement. Talk abilities need some work. Great night vision and signal strength is very good. Would like to have a longer live feed ability.,3
83939,It's about what I expected for the price. It's not at all soft and it left a ton of lint in the dryer on first wash. It also pulled in a couple of spots. I bought it to protect my duvet from my dogs so it meets my needs but if I'd gotten it to use as a blanket for humans it would go straight back.,3
109849,mic did dint work but the rest is ok,3
119855,"I know this product in liquid form is great, but these wipes didn't have enough of it on them to be super effective.",3
117409,Very pretty. But the backings are definitely not sterling silver/gold plated. I immediately got an infection.,3
86443,Arrived ripped on the side and it very hard to use.,3
101676,I was excited to get these salad tongs but was disappointed when I found that it was difficult to open. Hopefully it will get the more often we use them.,3
80232,"It,s OK. Cheap but I didn,t expect much. I do like the adjustable function. If the charger cord was any shorter it would be non existent. Easy to take out and about.",3
115819,did not like this it does not work well using the buttons would not buy it again,3
110358,They’re ok... thumb seems to be the only touch screen finger. Durability is sort of ok... I use them for motorcycling everyday but I’m not sure they would hold up in a crash. I’m just hoping they will...,3
95602,"This is a beautiful book. I had seen it at a friend's but was only able to glance very quickly at it so bought my own copy. Once in my hands with time to spend looking at it, I found it to be somewhat useless, like a coffee table book, a novelty. Pretty but not a go to for information.",3
99462,Didn't work as far as u could tell ended up using a service,3
103401,"The umbrella works ok, but it makes a lot of noise in the wind.",3
107437,both my 2 puppies love loved these but I am giving it 3 stars because it honestly didn't last long enough. It also stained my carpet.,3
97418,Good but WAY over priced. I will not likely purchase again,3
81902,"Nice full coverage mask but difficult to breathe with the mask on especially during the hot summertime. Wish there was a way this mask could be made with two thinner pieces of fabric (outer and liner) so breathing would be a little easier. Or, add one of those plastic gizmos that lets one breathe air easily.",3
96108,"The strap is inexpensive and that shows in the material finish. The leather is stiff and coarse. I bought this along with some more expensive straps and the others were much nicer, but also three or more times the price. Buy this one if you can't afford the others; otherwise, you will likely be better served with spending a little more on a strap that you enjoy wearing and makes you want to strap on your instrument and play. **If my review helped you, please click the “Helpful” button below.** Thanks!",3
107750,It's an decent plush. The hair is just a solid flat piece which was kind of disappointing.,3
80315,The product is ok ... You get what you pay for. Nothing more nothing less.,3
104788,Nice gaming platform.,3
108545,This doesn't work very well on pill bottles which was one of the main reasons I bought it.,3
96899,"Color and material is nice, blouse runs smaller than expected.",3
89157,it needs a mount for an ar15 for the barrel mounts with it are to large,3
113012,We returned this. Seemed like decent quality but the gray was almost blue/purple colored. I also didn’t prefer the larger square pattern as compared with other covers including the one we ended up keeping from another brand on amazon.,3
110646,"This is NOT a soft touch case. It is a smooth, slippery case that you will probably drop every time you pick it up. I am returning it. Updated: The Smoke/Volt color is the one that does not have soft touch. The others apparently do.",3
91841,"This chair was returned and then sent to me. I could see that it was assembled before I received it, hardware was scratched up and repackaged, arm rest were marked up. I didn't want to pack it all back up, so I kept it. I've had it less then a month and the seat bottom is flattening out, with not much cushion left. I'm 235 pounds, I was hoping that it was a better chair then this.",3
92942,"I give it 3 stars cause though the battery life is long, it kinda shorts out & turns off on its own often the closer it gets to dying. Other than that works great!!",3
84714,"Not as easy to install as advertised, and the instructions can be described as broken English at best. Once I deciphered through the jibberish and the equally non-helpful video, it wound up not working. If you have the time and already are familiar with wiring, go for it! Otherwise buy your camera someplace that will install with warranty!",3
117008,"This is oil rubbed bronze, NOT black! Also, it holds a lot less than I expected. The dimensions are an inch or so smaller than what the description states. Otherwise, it’s really cute.",3
176397,"I was really excited to see this book come up in my email, I missed that it was released a year ago. I immediately drove right into it. I have loved Andre and his causes since the trio of books Abuse came out. I really enjoyed reading about Andre's new project to save the innocent. I was sad to read that this book was a spin of true events. Although it didn't surprise me. Thanks Nikki Sex for another great book!!!!",5
190736,Still reading and applying it,5
183420,"This is truly a work of art. Exquisite detailing; sturdy, yet delicate; a perfect complement to any table setting from casual to formal. An excellent price, worth way more. I will be buying at least one or two more to give as gifts.",5
174040,Really love it. Fun for adults and kids. 8 year olds can't get enough.,5
168821,Great addition to hard mattress,5
179900,Haven't read it yet.,5

169310,"excellent! girls are different, the child is delighted. ordered again.",5
195762,"Excellent HD, Easy to connect and use , Data transfer speed it awesome, cable quality is also good, 100% recommend , you can use this with mac os too, i have mac so it run very smoothly in mac. Worth it !!!",5
170348,My cat loves this and it’s so easy to set up. I’ve had it for about 2 months now and it’s still going strong. Plus my cat no longer begs for sink water! Yay!,5
181140,This gives a great boost of flavor to fish-based or miso soups. I really love it.,5
192184,"Very comfy and look great! Fast delivery , thx !",5
193868,"I really like these books even if they are supposedly for kids. They are just as good as Grisham’s other novels, he just explains things more. The stories deal with issues that are in our headlines and that kids deal with.",5
166712,As expected and convenient.,5
189444,Have had so many compliments and one guy wants to buy this for his office!,5
167706,"Outstanding craftsmanship, package was damaged in shipping. I contacted the artist and replacement part was in the mail the next day. I love this clock.",5
175999,This little light is great! They got this one right and I love it.,5
191917,"First selves I purchase. So far there are no issues. Consistent manufacturing. Wish they were a tad thicker, but they are thin enough to double up if you want more protection.",5
193730,The fit was perfect. Helped keep my shoulder stable and relieved my pain. Also very comfortable to wear through the day.,5
163206,My wife likes the way it fits,5
166231,"After two months of use, I have to say this is the earphone I want. No distorted wire, great audio performance, decent battery life. Way better than Airpods except for portability.",5
178916,Awesome pillow. Bought for a gift & she loves it. It’s big & full body sized!,5
160295,For the price cant go wrong. Ive only had it a short time so cannot make statement regarding its longevity.,5
183357,Works well have noticed a difference in just the first 2 days my dog will start to bark then the coller seems to confuse her and she gets distracted and forgets what she was barking at. The unit itself is a nice size not too bulky my dog is 35 lbs and rather small she doesnt even seem to notice the box. Display is easy to read and all the functions are on one button and easy to change sensitivity and mode settings. I love that it has the option for no shock and a shock option. The product will beep for a few seconds vibrate twice then give a small static shock when in shock mode. Very light shock ive had worse in the winter from a blanket but enough to discourage the dog from barking. In no shock mode the unit will beep and vibrate only. I plan to use shock mode at first then transition into the no shock. I like that it allows you to do this by keeping the beeps and vibrations before the shock once trained the beep will be enough to stop the behavior without needing the added correction of the shock. The collars provided are easy to slip into the main unit while not recommended for tie out or walking are nicely made the nylon one has a well fastening plastic buckle and the plastic one has a belt clip and holes. Both are reflective as well so that is an added bonus. Took her for a swim and the unit survived so it does seem to be waterproof as well,5
175133,IF FIT PERFECTLY. SHE LIKES IT VERY MUCH.,5
191712,We use this outside at the pool to watch movies at night. Plenty bright. Would recommend for thos application.,5
183430,Awesome service with a smile as you can see. Hand written note and bonus stickers. Will be buying more. Thank you for your service as well. God bless America,5
196244,It takes 3 weeks to fully repel each & every rodent from your house.,5
191695,I am so impressed with this dress. The fabric is so soft and stretchy but doesn’t go sheer when stretched. It’s is true to size for US sizing which seems hard to find these days. I would buy again and recommend you give it a try. I wear a women’s 28 and I’m 5’5” with a large chest and this fits like a glove.,5
195824,"I love these for my male dogs , they are a perfect fit and stay on them absolutely wonderful, would recommend to anyone who has a male , great quality and an amazing price!",5
172125,Great price through Amazon,5
166882,This is no e light weight serum a use twice daily. Retinol is best for reducing wrinkles.,5
198218,Fits great and super cute and soft!,5
196714,These were awesome. Great colors and so many for the price.,5
174507,"This is the best wrist/thumb brace that I have ever had. It prevents the movement between the thumb and index finger and it minimizes the palm from bending just like the product description. I am now able to grab and turn the door knob, wash dishes and do chores around the house with this brace. I recommend this product to anyone who is suffering wrist and thumb pain.",5
191236,Was a gift for a friend and it was exactly what I wanted. She loved it. Arrived promptly. She loved it.,5
173226,Worker perfectly to photograph the eclipse!,5
190869,"Loved it. Couldn't put it down. Through stories about the main character, you learn of his complex life and the decisions he makes.",5
199967,its a brand name toy-- so you know what you are going to get. it is exactly as described. I found it is good for Kindergarten and up. Good rainy day/ cabin game.,5
161868,"I was skeptical about this. I didn't think it would get as heat as a real dryer, but it sure does! I have thick, curly hair. I used flexi-rods and my hair set perfectly. They recommend drying for 20-30 minutes, however if you have a lot of hair, you know you have to stay under longer. What I did was took breaks, and in total used it for about an hour and 15 minutes. You can adjust the hood to fit you more comfortably; so glad to have found this! I can travel with it easily.",5
162087,"Great quality, happy with product",5
186400,I bought this for my husband. He just loves it. It fits perfectly. The elastic feels good. It also feels cool and comfortable. The most important thing is It has a high quality.,5
196066,Absolutely love this necklace! I get so many compliments!,5
199547,Love love love this. I am 115 lbs 5’3. I have a larger bottom half and a flat chest. The skirt was perfect and sexy. The top was a bit large around the rib cage being a 32A but put on a busty strapless bra and it fills it out a little more! It’s SO comfy and great quality,5
166767,Awesome product. Reasonably priced. Looks great. Easy to install. Adheres pretty well,5
164747,This was a birthday present to myself and WOW did it make a difference with my seedlings. I wish I could buy more,5
182790,Works on Windows 10 even if the percentage meter doesn't show a connection.,5
174014,"LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!! It’s worth the money and cheaper than the name brand ones. My son (3 months) loves this and sleeps so peacefully. To get different positions for baby, look up baby carrier sling on YouTube. They have so many ways!",5
190162,"This electric wine opener is very good, it looks good quality, It is very convenient to use and suitable for girls.",5
162185,"This kit includes everything you could possibly need to knit or crochet. The materials look good quality and the organizer box is really practical. The knitting needles are a bit on the short side, but work perfectly fine for smaller projects.",5
176641,"Super soft, wash well, true to size. Great for play, sleep and everything in between. Lightweight cotton. These Carter’s pants are literally the only pants I’ve been putting on my son since we was about 3 months old.",5
176847,"Secure-fitting magnetic wristband is handy for holding extra drill bits, screws, and other small hardware",5
181238,"They're paperclips, what can I say?",5
160139,I liked the convenience of ordering this online and that it arrived promptly.,5
174016,First time I have ordered this and it wasn't NOT damaged love the bubble wrapper envelope.,5
189685,Love these! Small but perfect for my kitchen/dinning area. True to colors. Vibrant but not overpowering accent.,5
162286,Very loud and just the right size.,5
169487,"This is so easy to put up. It is just command strips. It is very sturdy and can hold ALOT of head bands and weight. I've hand mine up for a long time now and no issues. It looks great and takes up minimal space compared to other ear holders. Plus, it is a great way to show off your ears!",5
176786,"My Daughter spilt cereal in my car. After soaking, scrubbing, and applying enzyme cleaner, the smell was still there. Just one of these and my car smells crispy clean.",5
198682,"Very nice feel to this hardware. The smart key feature is really great allowing using the key from one bolt to match all 4 I had installed. Operation is very smooth unlike the big box store hardware. If you are installing a quality project, recommend Baldwin.",5
164623,"These dice are great, first 3 rolls were an 18, then 2 20's in a row. I will be buying more.",5
182683,"Works great. I am using one for as a Data Cable for my because I lost my old one. Bad news is my 5 bit the dust and it is not used on the Edge. Oh well, now my husband has an extra cord to keep in his truck.",5
173781,"I use these daily, and they work well. I really wasn't sure what to expect at this price point, but these were definitely worth the cost, and make the case that spending more would be a waste. I do have to say that they're pretty fragile-feeling, but they give no sign of breaking.",5
186365,"Easy travel, good quality.",5
72149,"It fits the phone well, but got dirty within the first few days, and impossible to clean it. Won't buy again :(",2
69048,I was not impressed with this magazine. There is no substance to it - not really any articles to read. It's mostly pictures with some captions and some recipes. I bought the one issue to see if it was something I would want to subscribe to. I decided it's not.,2
49671,"Used six of these on a recent family trip. Four flights later, two of them were bent. They are made of some sort of metal, maybe aluminum, and if they get tossed around or mangled in the luggage processing facility they will bend. The idea is good - I like only being able to see your name on the info card and your address and phone number covered but having them bent up after only one use? They need to change the material to a silicone or leather type of material that can handle being tossed around by man and machine.",2
45251,We bought this for our teenage son who was traveling over seas for two weeks and I was very disappointed when he told us that he couldn't use it in most of the hotels because it kept blowing breakers.,2
58561,There is no way to turn the power on/off on this timer. What a waste of batteries! And what a pain in the a$# to put the battery in and out each time I make tea. I would not recommend this product.,2
78877,Doesn't fit well on my head,2
42546,They DO burn and are much smaller than estimated.,2
63462,The insane amout of dlc this game has is ridiculous. And on top of that it's censored. Please stop supporting KT as they'll keep on censoring any game they can publish in America.,2
74552,"They were too short for my taste and, this may be my fault, but I ordered a size 9 and because they were high tops, my waist was too small and the jeans were a little loose. Also, I expected them to be more tight fitting towards the butt area, but they were not. I considered ordering a smaller size, but then they would’ve been even shorter on me.",2
65910,After a couple of months the machine stops brewing coffee at the selected size ; the clean cycle light keeps turning on and the clean cycle never completes a cycle.,2
68177,I bought medium but they are way to narrow and I can’t wear them. I have used this type of product for many years and this is the first time I couldn’t get them on my toes easily and when I did it was way too tight and hurt,2
58386,"The back of the case is nice, slicker than I thought which is fine, still comfortable, but the overall materials (rubber/plastic casing) is pretty flimsy. Though the most important feature, the lip for the glass screen, is just too short by a mm or 2. So, if you use a glass screen protector, like zagg, when putting phone face down, you will be sitting on the glass, not on the case's lip. Also, I dont believe that if this phone was dropped that it would actually do much for protection. I was under the impression this would be a bit more rigid, like incipio or incase. Full edge shock protection is quite a stretch.",2
52909,"Good material and comfortable but they fall off your ass. It's weird cause usually spandex hugs, these feel like they lack some rear end material.",2
50717,Mine were damaged! I’m very disappointed. I waited along time for shipping also.,2
40930,"Why is there a drawstring? The picture and description doesn’t mention anything about the suit having a drawstring around the neck. The velcro width is thin but strong, which is the only pro. The fabric feels like spandex, which idk if it’s a good thing or a bad thing. I purchased this and the exact same one from a different seller for $1 more, and the more expensive one didn’t come with a drawstring and had a wider velcro. Returning this and keeping the other.",2
76244,Actually I have had nothing but trouble replacing a strand of lights from the one's I bought last year. I have now bought quite a few that did not match.,2
74377,"First, this product did not fit my 2004 Honda CRV, as advertised, without cutting off the tow hook, a task I couldn't have completed if I was trying to install this at home. Secondly, the day after installation we loaded a bike rack and a single bike onto the hitch, only for the back driver side bolt to immediately shear off. When I contacted the company, they were polite but unable to answer my question about the size or grade of the bolt. We ended up going to Uhaul who generously gave us some of the extra carriage bolts and accompanying rectangular plates. All of those bolts were at least a grade five. The bolts in this package are not labeled with markings to suggest what grade they are. I ended up asking the Pep Boys crew who installed to replace all the bolts, and in addition to the one sheared bolt, there was etching along the others, suggesting that they too were weakening. While my situation is now under control, this hitch caused quite a few extra headaches, and I would be wary about trusting that it fits the vehicles it claims to fit and that the quality is sufficient to hold even a minor load.",2
73629,The wrist band won’t stay on. The clasp is worthless.,2
68895,The orbits do not get big at all the bottle they came in is very small!,2
44511,"I purchased thos fishing tackle kit, however I did not realise how small the kit is. Unable to use it will keep it in storage.",2
76487,"The fit is to put it in the words of my wife, ""old man pants"". Which just means it was very baggy in the wrong places. Compared to other pants purchased that are regular fit, it appeared too lose. However the fit with regards to size appeared to be accurate as the waist and length was correct, just the style appeared outdated. To be clear, I'm not comparing the fit to ""slim fit"" type styles. I'm comparing to regular fit as I had ordered these for work. We have business casual but wear ties, no coat or jacket. I'm hopeful this will be updated as the price is very economical and I purchase these with the attitude it's a uniform.",2
66766,The design makes it very hard to wash baby's lower body,2
70699,"They do the job, but they are a little stiffer than I would have liked. So when you are wearing them they are not soft around the edges and they leave an impression on your face. I actually don't use them for that reason.",2
48122,did not fit my car even though it said it would i have a 2010 chevy equinox i dont know whos fault amazons or company,2
71026,Working 10 hour shifts not a good chair. Can only adjust the chair by going up and down.,2
65225,Not good product recieved one that was broken ..,2
56262,"The design I got was pretty cute, it’s the black one with the stars on it. Unfortunately, it’s cheaply made, because one week after use, the black started rubbing off and you can see the white underneath. Also in the photos, you can see on the edges it’s starting to break. Overall wouldn’t recommend. You can get a much better quality one for a few dollars more.",2
57899,They are cute in person. I bought the xl and they fit my daughter who is a size 4/5. Very disappointed in fit.,2
57613,The design was not thought through here. The soft tip leaves hairs in my glassware.,2
50017,Didn't fit well. Pops up in the middle which makes it difficult to text.,2
48186,"I have two very specific things that I HATE about this clock. (1) The most dim display setting is still tremendously too bright. It lights up the entire room and (2) when you wake to radio you can not turn the volume down to wake you more gently. The radio comes on quietly for about 5 seconds and then becomes significantly too loud. When I read the directions, it says that the wake to radio volume setting can't be turned down, because they do not want you to inadvertently set it to no sound at all (and thus not wake you up). I appreciate the need for a minimum sound setting, but it should be one third of what it is now. You must turn off the radio once it wakes you up, because no one would ever want it this loud. BUT, the clock LOOKS cool, the time sets itself, there is a cool USB charger for your phone. Still the two flaws listed above make this a clock radio that I would not recommend.",2
64173,Texture is terrible. Mushy and crusty and VERY SWEET. yuck.,2
61238,Cheap product broken after one week of use...,2
71465,"It looks great and is reasonably well made. But I'm sending it back for three reasons. It smells like mold. The zipper is sewn in a way that the edge of zipper gets caught in the teeth as you zip it up. Super annoying. Strap is sadly too short. I guess I fall into the ""particularly burly"" category, as the product description cautions. I'm 5ft 9in and 185 lbs. Worn across the body the bag is at the level of my stomach.",2
79218,I'm really bummed. I was excited thinking I got a good deal read the good reviews but this product didnt work. and tended to hurt my teeth 😔,2
71925,Yes it pumped water. The tether was too short to keep a consistent contact to run the pump. But when it does run it doesn't shut off when the water is gone. Returning it.,2
74284,I would not buy these in bulk again because too many of the batteries are defective.,2
71087,"I was using these for a project, I ordered a total of about 96 units, a hand full had too small of a hole in the back and caused product failure of the project we were involved in.",2
61882,Would be great if it wasn’t so lightweight and cheap that the pieces fall over constantly.,2
78069,Packaging came in fine but once we tried it on ourselves the staple on the side barely held. We actually wasn’t able to use this at all for our Pirate Party. Bummer because the quality and colors looked great. However once you try to assemble it just doesn’t hold up . Maybe you can try it on yourself and tape it on the side? Or you can try re-stapling the whole set again..,2
59606,"Our pup absolutely loves the angel, and it instantly became his favorite toy. And I absolutely love that the noise is so much less annoying then any squeaky toy he had. Unfortunately, the 2nd hedgehog we ordered doesn't grunt. I'm going to look into returning it, but seems an awful lot of work for a $10 dog toy.",2
69983,"I purchased this toaster after reading many reviews of the Oster 2-Slice toaster in hopes that this would deliver the same quality toasting. IT DOES NOT! There is NEVER an even toasting no matter where I place my bread, how many pieces are in or even the type (bread, bagel, etc). I am very disappointed.",2
78956,"I had to order it three times before it went through and when it arrived, the 18” plastic shoe horn was missing.",2
74161,"Doesn't last long. Changed batteries, but to no avail. Returning the product so we'll see how they honor the 2 year warranty. Also, there was no cleaning brush.",2
78143,"I love this Kettle, however, after about 10 uses the automatic shut off no longer works. It still heats up, but you have to manually keep an eye on it as it will continue to boil - all the water down which then creates a safety issue.",2
46728,I never received the stylus that it shows with it.,2
66967,these were were wire-not ribbon.,2
49393,Overall is ok but its doesn't have a lock for the pull handle. Always fall down when my child use it.,2
75728,This movie was intriguing but then fell apart at the end. It could have done a better job at tying up and connecting some of the story lines but instead became clunky and lost momentum.,2
46322,Heater burnt out already,2
63098,Sending back looks a mess,2
79779,This one fell apart on first use. I'd say it performed very poorly compared to others I bought and use.,2
62251,The plot was really weak. It was like watching a cheap Hollywood movie where nothing in the plot surprises.,2
41146,"I don't know how they can list up to 16 mile range. We just used these for a drive from Florida to Pennsylvania. It probably should say range of 1.6 miles. It definitely did not have over a 2 mile range. If you were close to the other car they worked fine, but honestly anything over a mile was bad or not at all. These did not meet my need for them at all.",2
72922,"More difficult to use than just grabbing with your finger, but I used it for Invisalign so that's my bad. Maybe a retainer will pop out much easier.",2
45839,I cannot comment on this item as I will have to return it; one of the 2 bottle received expired 6 months ago. The other had about 8 months remaining before expiration.,2
47542,Sizes vary. I ordered 3 pair different color. 2 of them very tight 1 very loose.,2
