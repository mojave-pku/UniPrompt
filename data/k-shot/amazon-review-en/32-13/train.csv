55460,"First off, this took weeks to get here. I didn't realize it was shipping from China or I would have paid a few bucks extra and gotten one that was Prime. I don't hold that against the seller it's just that I didn't realize that when I bought it. The actual product is kind of crap. I tested the first 3 keychains, #1 worked just fine and is on my car keys. #2 didn't work at all, and #3 works some of the time (I have it velcro'd to my Fire remote). I thought at first maybe the receiver just doesn't work through walls (even though the transmitter was about 10 feet away)- but the keychain transmitter was able to ping in the exact same location so it's just a faulty transmitter. It does ping sometimes - but every time it has been after I'd already found the dang thing and brought it close to the transmitter to test that it was working at all. Defeats the point! I'm really disappointed in this product and based on 2 out of 6 (again, I didn't test the other 3 so it might be a higher %) not functioning as they should I'd say give this particular product a pass. One of the tested transmitters DID work and works well, so it's not a 1 star - maybe I just got an old/bad set.",2

40478,"The case itself seems fine, but it doesn’t work well with my phone so I need to return it. There was no return label included or option for exchange. This is really frustrating and will mean that I will choose a different product.",2
49027,"Got this a while ago, it worked great for a while. Now it randomly stops playing (freezes). When it does this, the only thing we can do is open the tray, and close it, and hope that it reads the disc right. Which it didn't this last time. While playing a brand new DVD (so no marks or scratches and it plays fine in every other machine in the house). Definitely buying a different brand next time. Oh, and as a side note -- the remote operates on the same frequency as my sound bar, so when I try to turn that up or down, it performs random functions on the DVD player.",2
58060,I paid for a new book and recieved a torn book.,2
58738,I liked this product enough that I bought two so I’d never have to have my phone plugged in. However after 5 months it caught fire after sitting in my car without a phone in it for roughly a hour. As a result my brand new truck caught fire and now stuck with a $500 deductible to fix the damages,2
59327,Thin and sheds like crazy,2

78610,Looks and feels substantial until start to wash and use. It is not a easy convenient tool. I would not purchase again.,2
54784,"I can't tell you how long it took me to assemble the helmet. I had to put it down on the first try (AFTER my husband tried) because I just didn't have time. It is ridiculously hard to put the two pieces together because there are several connecting points that have to be aligned perfectly before it gets locked in. Because it's a flexible plastic, the points wouldn't stay aligned and it took considerable strength to push the parts together to lock in, once they were aligned. It was so frustrating. The helmet was one reason we chose this costume for a school presentation. And it was a hit, I will say that but it was so frustrating to assemble and I'm just glad I had the time to sit down with it. The jumper was fine but it is see-through. So be prepared to wear something underneath. My son wore skinny jeans and a T-shirt underneath.",2

191859,"Love this! Not only can I travel all day without having to find a way to charge my phone, but it actually makes it a lot easier to handle the phone given the weight and shape. The case also does a great job protecting the phone- I've dropped it at least 5 times since using this case and it's been fine every time! Would definitely recommend.",5
173793,"Expensive but so good it is worth it. Particularly on those nights when you're too tired to rinse your face. This can be wiped off instead of rinsed. I have very sensitive skin and this leaves it soft and without any irritation. I don't even need to use any type of moisturizer when I use this cleanser. You need so little of this, it lasts a very long time; making the price much more reasonable in the long run.",5

Sound is great, clear highs and strong bass... all in balance. The bluetooth connection is very stable. The microphone in the headphones is extremely sensitive and can be a bit much when using for phone calls. The battery life is astounding... charge it up before a business trip and I dont have to worry about it until I get home. Worth every penny!!!!",5
196710,Great gift for teachers,5

9669,Purchases to try to help my cat. 16 years old with a heart and kidney problem and walking a tight rope right now. She would not eat it and I did not even realize that it was supposed to be refrigerated after you open that. Or a girl that she would not eat it. I contacted the seller asking if I could return the unopened tub since I got two tubs and I believe they made a fair offer to return the money for one tub and help me just throw out the rest of it. So I supposed to get half of the purchase price back. Figured that was fair enough. Problem is when they refunded money they only refunded a quarter of the purchase price instead of half. Not sure if this was a miscommunication. So I am still trying to work on it.,1

I soaked them in hot water and Dawn dish soap and then thoroughly cleaned each and every one of them ...as soon as they dried the smell returned...I threw them in the trash after seeing that the oily residue was even leaving marks on my kitchen table. I don't know what it was but I was very disappointed in this purchase and was completely unable to use the product at all.,1

This is a very smart device as each single station can be rotated and it can accommodate large power cords too easily. Another cool feature is USB adaptor which can be used to charge phone directly. There are two limitations with the product though 1) as I understand from using it, it does not has over charge protection 2) the max current combined of the USB port is 2.1 A which is kind of less if both the USB stations are in use",4

However, when I opened the bottle it was SMURF blue! The manufacturer felt the need to add FD&C Blue #1 to the product. First - WHY; and second, if you're adding a DYE, why BLUE? Isn't curcumin orange/yellow? I strongly feel that if it is not necessary to the quality or performance of the product - keep it as pure as possible. I've got to think (and I'll research this) that the DYE is not dangerous, but I question the necessity to add it at all...
