They are actually really bright blue. One star for fit and material: I love the fit. I got a small and I’m 135 and 5’7 and they fit great, but the seam is coming out at the bottom.

54557,Junk.... stay with OEM if at all possible.,2
76164,I’m giving this a 2 star because the fit is as expected. But the quality is awful! Almost like t-shirt material! Very cheap looking. These shorts should be $4 at most!,2

79258,I bought this because everyone was raving they are like lululemons. I did not like how these looked on me at all. They don’t hold you in like lulu or Fabletics leggings. I felt like it gave me camel toe which is a problem I’ve never had before.,2
41961,"After five days of use counter quit working and had to buy a driveway sensor off a friend because it was shipped without one, I contacted seller but they gave me the run around so it was easier to just buy one off my friend, but it works good no thanks to seller",2

These came in a box that had the colors, but the bottle labels are in black white and gray. And states that the product has been repackaged. The repackaged eye drops are not as thick as my previous eye drops have been. They seem to be 'watered down' if you will. I have severe dry eye, and the previous eye drops helped, These bottles with the gray, white and black labels do not work as well. I am very disappointed with this order of these eye drops.",2

161844,Outstanding product. Bought this item to keep raccoons away from my avocado and Barbados Cherries tree. Was not sure if it work so purchased only one at first. After a couple days it was obvious that this product really work so purchased a second unit since I have a lot of fruit trees. Now I can enjoy my fruits without worrying about raccoons and squirrels. This is the first time I have no damage to my trees. If I had a regret is that I did not purchase this before. Plan to buy another one for another section of my yard.,5

25476,"This CPAP cleaning system uses UV light to disinfect which is fine. The problem is that you have to completely disassemble your hose, mask and water reservoir for it to work. The SoClean system is much better as the entire hose, mask and reservoir is disinfected at one time WITHOUT taking the CPAP unit apart and sterilizing it piece by piece..unless you have nothing better to do with your time. I sent this UV unit back and it cost me $10 in shipping so I'm trying to save you the time and money ordering this. The ozone smell will quickly dissipate once the mask and headgear is removed from the SoClean unit which they state as a problem...NOT.",1

1155,I just opened my package and went to apply the tempered glass like I have done on many devices. I went to pull the tab to remove the protective film before applying it to my device and there was NO plastic film. I checked the second one in the package and found the very same thing. Just a peel tab stuck directly to the tempered glass it self. Very Unhappy with the product quality!,1
27001,Couldn't figure out how to inflate it.,1
27435,This product did not help my poodle at all. It fit just like the picture showed but it rubs the penis of the dog because of where the velcro attaches to the unit. I even wrapped the sewn edge to pad where it hits. My dog was pretty much bed ridden so it wasn't due to him moving around. It caused us another problem. Save your money and just wait 1 or 2 months for your dog to heal.,1

The glue did not hold the plastic to the cardboard. I’m guessing the blade cover fell out wherever these are packaged. I wouldn’t mind if I had just ordered a scissors, but I ordered a scissors WITH A BLADE COVER. I should be getting what I ordered.",1

11132,"This is the cheapest made thing I've ever bought for my kitchen. The pump buttons don't work. I at for almost 15 minutes just pumping the button over and over, and the oil didn't move more than a 1/4 inch after all that. The buttons kept popping out and separating from the housing every 10 pumps or so. Taking it apart and putting it back together helped for all of about 5 pumps, and then it stopped working again. If it had better construction I'm sure it would be great, but in this form it is essentially useless. I finally looked it up online and found this is a huge issue with it, but for some reason those reviews haven't propagated to the Amazon page for the product yet.",1

139156,It is nice color but my lips feel sensitive when I put this on.,4
136566,A Tony bit smaller than I expected but it does the job. Great price,4
156160,It is a very well written paranormal romance that draws you in from the beginning. The relationship takes place on the psychic and physical plane and you get an intimate look at both Rage and Pandora and really understand their motivations and their feelings. Maybe it is a little rushed but that's my opinion mostly because I prefer slow burn romances... Like previous books I really liked this one to.,4
124133,I read the reviews before ordering and i got them and i really like them. Not as true to color as the picture but close enough.,4
122539,"At first I was really excited about this find. It looks sleek and nice. It fits under cabinet fine. But when lifting the head, it hits the wall, so it has to be pulled out some, wouldn’t be a big deal, but the awesome thing that keeps it from bouncing around(suction cups on the bottom), makes it a bit of an ordeal. But easily ignored. The one thing I am very disappointed about, everytime I use it, is how far the mixing tools(paddle and whisk) are from the actual bowl. Easily 1/4 of an inch away. It makes the mixture leave a layer of mix against the bowl, never to be touched by the mixing tools. So it HAS to be turned off and sides scraped, multiple times during use. Way past the time to send back, and is better than having nothing. However, I would look for one that has the mixing tool much closer to the edges of the bowl, so you really can leaving it mixing to itself.",4

Future buyer: you may have to adjust the amount of filling to suit your needs.",4
159778,"This attachment is awesome. The adapter raises the possibility of the Headphones. Audio sounds great coming from the adapter, but the volume is not as loud as it is wired. One big con is their is some type of sound that the adapter makes. It sounds like there is a bit of frequency. Another con of the adapter is the price. The way the buttons click and the adapter feel is not what you would expect from something that cost $50. If this product was between $30-40 it would be fair. Another con is the batter life is on the short range. It is not terrible but if it could last 2hrs longer it would be perfect.",4
134755,The dress is exactly as pictured and really very pretty. It fits my daughter but may be a tad big around the chest. Not too big that she can't wear it. She's tall and lean so overall it probably is true to size. Definitely recommend it.,4

105756,Heard repair never work that well,3
106176,Cable to short for crew cab long bed pickups. It's about 4 feet to short to work on our 05 Ford F-350 crew cab long bed. Now i'm trying to band aid a solution. Can't replace as it has the trigger wire for the cam at the dash end and a tap for reverse light at the back end. Shenanigans.,3
100698,"Good product for a quick touchup, not for everyday use.",3
80447,"Product fits my daughter's new tablet perfectly and I love the design. I was a little bummed the case came damaged when there was no damage to the outer packaging. My kiddo is 8 so there's no sending it back and waiting for the replacement. Still, I'm happy with the purchase overall",3

115504,Pages were all blank. I expected a general outline for needed information,3
113705,Plastic; sweats on surfaces when filled with drinks and ice.,3
110297,"Very cute, my kids are really enjoying learning to sew with these. This particular brand, however, looses the color on the plastic. This is a problem because you need the color to know where to put your stitches. It rubs off over time making it slightly more difficult to figure out where to put what color. But there are other things I like better than other kits. Like the actual metal needle. Others only come with plastic needles. And the holes on this kit are smaller which, in my opinion, makes the finished product look better.",3
87882,"They are a nice weight and the color is pretty, but the d12 is a bit uneven and the d8 shipped with a small chip. I do wish that they did have the turquoise marbling as shown on the photo.",3
102434,"It's exactly what I excepted it to be. However, I just want to state a suggestion/improvement to the product. It would be nice if you have a quantity of 4 sets of legs. That way you could use an extra set to raise your stand a little higher. So I will have 2 spare plastic platforms and 2 outfitted with all the legs. I needed to raise my monitor just a tad more than what was provided. So, I ordered another one just so I can raise my other stand.",3
94299,Perfect for what we paid and where we are using the product. Will move it into the garage in a year or two and upgrade to something better for where it is at now.,3
91202,They worked well. I liked the fit and look but after 3 months of moderate use they no longer turn on.,3
80731,"I was really disappointed by this stuff. Some reviews said it was great for fine hair, but unfortunately, it made my very fine hair greasy and weighed it down. I’ve used a very small amount and tried it for a few weeks, but it just isn’t working for me. It would probably be ok for semi-fine hair, but my search for a shine and anti-frizz product that works on truly super fine hair continues!",3
101594,This book is designed for a caregiver in a group home setting. Not for someone that is taking care of an elderly parent with dementia. The author has some good points but overall the book did not provide anything I didn’t already know.,3
101442,This was a great idea but fell short of what I wanted and needed. Half and half is available in most places I travel and it tastes so much better. For countries that don’t have half and half this will have to do.,3
116271,"good screen resolution, lightweight. however it sometimes overheats when charging and takes long to charge. the voice unlock is intermittent and face unlock DOES NOT WORK",3
104623,The diffuser bracelet didn't fit. The leather piece could be longer to accommodate a larger bony wrist. The chakra beads are great! A little tight for me but still workable since it's elastic. I would buy again for friends with smaller wrists.,3
107018,My husband spent a little more money on this net than some other choices. But we were disappointed by the quality. It didn’t seem more heavy-weighted netting and the knots nearest to the rim came undone (the net was not installed and I think one of my kids grabbed it but the knots slip out easily) and so we had to re-tied knots). Clearly that is not easily done. We couldn’t figure out the type of knot they used in the first place.,3
97591,"These fit fine/somewhat small, but are made of very thin fabric. They are really more like think tights. Fine only if you plan to wear with a long tunic.",3
106834,"These are for use IN DARK AREAS! I admit, I didn't pay enough attention to the description. The automatic mode works great in low light and dark areas but if there's any significant amount of light in the room they simply won't turn on automatically, and the switch is a bit too difficult to justify constantly turning these on and off. I tried to set these up in the corner of a room that could use a little more light, but these lights would never turn on because there were still ceiling lights in the room and it wasn't quite dark enough to trigger it. I found a good use for them next to the front door so when we enter the house at night it turns on and we don't trip over any pets that might come running to the door. That being said, if you have pets the battery life of these will probably not be as great as you might expect because they will trigger only at night... your mileage may vary.",3
97371,Didn’t like it. Made my hair feel greasy and heavy no matter how much I used. Didn’t give me any type of beach look,3
