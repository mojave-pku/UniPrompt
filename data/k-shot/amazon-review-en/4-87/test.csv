0,"These are AWFUL. They are see through, the fabric feels like tablecloth, and they fit like children‚Äôs clothing. Customer service did seem to be nice though, but I regret missing my return date for these. I wouldn‚Äôt even donate them because the quality is so poor.",1
1,I bought 4 and NONE of them worked. Yes I used new batteries!,1
2,On first use it didn't heat up and now it doesn't work at all,1
3,You want an HONEST answer? I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon. Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag! I didn't bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back. Will NEVER order another thing from your company. A disgrace. Honest enough for you? Grandma,1
4,The glue works fine but the container is impossible to work with. The cap doesn't come off without plyers and then won't go back on without a violent abrupt force involving both hands and a solid object (desk drawer). This happened even though I was careful to not gum up the lid or tapering snout.,1
5,"I was over the moon when I got this. I love sunflowers and it looked exactly like they advertised, unfortunately I wore this piercing for one weekend. By Sunday night the sunflower had came off. I will not be purchasing from this company again. Very disappointed.",1
6,"Gotta say, not impressed with the quality. I mean, I can't say I expected it to be overwhelmingly amazing with the cost being where it's at. But, certainly I thought it would last longer than a few days. Had the phone in my gym bag. Slid out from the side and barely tapped the wall. On the aluminum side. Not even on the glass. And low and behold, instantaneous crack. Oddly enough, just on the back. Not a splinter at all on the front. Not sure if the back is intentionally more susceptible to damage or just my luck. Either way, I have to give this product a thumbs down. Wish it held up better. It really is a nice design. I am a fan of how the product looks and the concept. No issue there. Just not durable at all.",1
7,I would give this zero stars if I could. This is 6.3 you ounces of low grade chocolate for $60. My 9 year old daughter was so disappointed. It didn't even have a different piece for each day. It was mostly flat square wrapped milk chocolate with no design at all!!! Very very poor quality and expensive!,1
8,Two of the glasses were broken when I opened the package. Could you please be careful for packaging glass items.,1

10,"Really, really thin.",1
11,Never received item. Given a refund.,1
12,Terrible!!!! I couldnt even attach it to the screen,1

14,"I mean the case looks cool. I don‚Äôt know anything about functionality but they sent me a iPhone 8 Plus case. The title says 6 plus, I ordered a 6 plus and there was no option on selecting another iPhone size beside 6 and 6 plus so I‚Äôm very disappointed in the service",1

17,Belt loops were not fastened upon opening. They were not stitched.,1
18,"These headphones were great in the beginning. Easy to charge, stayed in my ears, and had great sound quality. Unfortunately, they crapped out about a year after I purchased them. They will charge but no longer turn on.",1
19,Ran entirely too small,1
20,"Had them for like a month, during which time I used them maybe once for 5 minutes. Otherwise kept in the included case. They broke right away. The nosepiece - which is made of a paper-like material glued to a tiny strip of clear plastic - snapped the second time I tried to wear them. Since it's the only thing that holds them up, the glasses essentially became trash after that. Don't waste your time no matter how deep the discount.",1
21,"I bought Halo before, but this one does not look the same! It seems to have lots of fat (a white greasy substance) in it!",1
22,First of all the package was shoved into my mail box and was basically crushed when I pulled it out. In addition there are deep marks and scrapes that show the wallet was used or pre-owned before getting to me..,1
23,The battery covers screw stripped out the first day on both cars I purchased for Christmas.,1
24,Shame you can't give it 0 stars I ordered this and the package says shipped but I did not receive the package contacted the seller 2 times and still no answer after two weeks very disappointed.,1
25,It didn‚Äôt work at all. All the wax got stuck at the top and would never flow.,1
26,"The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you‚Äôre finished weeding! It‚Äôs so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they‚Äôre aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it‚Äôs okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate üòè Possibly it‚Äôs old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don‚Äôt either!",1
27,"Sorry but these are a waste of money! The balls constantly fall off after a certain amount of time and the paint/coloring chips off! It‚Äôs gross, but I had a big piece of the color chip off while I was wearing one, which meant extra cleaning later that evening. POOR QUALITY, don‚Äôt waste your money on these ones!! :(",1

40,I had it less than a week and the c type tip that connects to my S9 got burnt.,1
41,I was very disappointed in this item. It is very soft and not chewy. It falls apart in your hand. My dog eats them but I prefer a more chewy treat for my dog.,1
42,I am very annoyed because it came a day late and it didn‚Äôt come with the ferro rod and striker which is the main reason why I ordered it,1
43,Waste of money!! Don‚Äôt buy this product. just helping community. I trusted reviews about that but all wrong,1
44,"The wires did not last long at all. The piece that connects to the phone comes off, you have to have the phone sitting in a certain position for the phone to charge.",1
45,"I ordered a screen for an iPhone 8 Plus, but recevied product that was for a different phone. A significantly smaller phone.",1
46,"I was so excited about this and wanted to like it so much. My dog (who is not a strong chewer AT ALL) destroyed it in under 5 minutes :/ $11 down the drain for NOTHING. Great concept, extremely poor execution unfortunately.",1
47,"WE ORDERED THIS, HUNG THE LIGHT AND ONLY 4 OUT OF THE 5 LIGHTS WORKED.",1
48,"I got 2 pars in different colors. When started using them realized that its too late to return. Not comfortable, give blisters in the open area where the toes are each step getting worst. ended-up with 5 blisters in the different area of my feet. . The sole is coming apart, I had to glue it. I feel ripped off.",1

64,They are all smashed. I have pictures. They look melted and all smashed.,1
65,"The child hat is ridiculously small. It was not even close to the right size for my 3 year old son. I checked the size, and it wouldn't have even fit him as a newborn. I liked the adult hat but it is not sold separately. The seller was rude and unhelpful when I contacted them directly through Amazon. The faux fur pom was either already torn or tore when I was trying on the hat. See the attached photograph. The pom came aprt, exposing the inner fluff.",1

70,Product was fine but only 2 were in the packet v 3 as advertised. I contacted the distributor they said they would send out another one which they didn't. I never heard back from Amazon either. It was very expensive for two bags!,1
71,Does not work. Not supported by device pops up.,1
72,It is cheap - and yes it is a CHEAP product.,1
73,The FIRST time I used this product the zipper broke. It arrived 3 hours ago and I'm already sending it back. I'm very frustrated as I wasted time debating between this product and competitors. Obviously I made the wrong choice.,1
74,Does not work as described.,1
75,The Product arrived broken. Amazon immediately put me in touch with CPO the sellers. CPO said they will not honor the Amazon product return refund policy without pictures of the item sent prior to the item being returned. Beware do not buy from this third party vendor.,1

77,"When you order a product, you expect the product to be as described. They were advertised as CAP Dumbbells. However, the product received was Golds Gym dumbbells. If I wanted Golds Gym, I would have bought these from Walmart. I have a complete set of CAP dumbbells, with the exception of my one set from Golds Gym. Is the weight correct, yes. Due they perform, yes. I just expect to get what I paid for not something else. After reading a few other reviews, I see that others have had the same issue.",1
78,I bought this product and thought it was awesome in the box but when I shot it I discovered it jammed frequently and pinches you at the top unless your very careful and after about 10 ft the pellet curves upward severely. After it fell from a barely 2 ft tall coffee table it broke and would not cock Iv also noticed after reading a lot of reviews that this is frequent,1

82,It arrived broken. Not packaged correctly.,1
83,"Wish I would of read the reviews prior to purchase. This DVD is sadly the worst DVD I have ever purchased. Either here on Amazon or other sites. It plays on my DVD player but the quality is horrible. Also, the first 15-20 minutes or so is just unwatchable. The picture is all scrambled. This is obviously a shoddy bootlegged version from a vhs tape. Amazon really needs to stop selling this!!!",1

89,"Did not stick to the wall at all, a lot of it was ripped and it wasn't as full as pictured. I wish I could get my money back but the only way to find out how bad this product is was to use it. Super disappointed, I would not recommend this at all.",1
90,He‚Äôd are just cheap polyester sheets. NOT MICROFIBER! Not super soft. They‚Äôre silky soft like cheap polyester is.,1

95,"The picture shows the fuel canister with the mosquito repeller attached so I assumed it would be included. However, when I opened the package I discovered there was no fuel. Since it is not included, the picture should be removed. If someone orders this and expects to use it immediately, like I did, they will be very disappointed.",1
96,Lasted one wear and then melted off when worn on the pavement. I took them off and the adhesive was all over the bottom so i took them to a cobbler instead and got them professionally done. Would not ever put these on my red bottoms again.,1

99,"Not wanting to give it any stars, I gave it 1. Sound quality stinks and that is only with the music it will listen to. It won‚Äôt connect or even recognize the Apple 11Pro it was trying to connect to, so it never worked to make phone calls even with my Bose earbuds. I‚Äôm going back to Apple products.

118,"Candy was shipped on a Friday, arrived on Tuesday, and in terrible shape...all melted and gooey. It was sent in some insulated wrapping but still did not survive the heat. Lesson learned. Don't order chocolate in summertime.",1

123,Item did not fit my car properly.,1
124,I received a broken angle plate and i m very upset for the package!!!!!!,1
125,This will not help you with finding anything at all. It doesn‚Äôt offer any true guidance. Just some basic questions and you write your response. It‚Äôs just a journal nothing more. Very disappointed. Instead of wasting your money on this I would recommend The path made clear by Oprah is way more helpful. Or just get yourself a notebook and write your daily thoughts down and reflect once a week. That‚Äôs it. Save your money.,1

129,The package only had 1 rectangular pan and 1 cupcake pan. Missing 2 rectangular pans.,1
130,I don‚Äôt think the design fits for the phone. It blocks the fingerprint on the side. I can‚Äôt use my fingerprint to unlock the phone with this case on.,1

140,Better off buying the kits,1

145,"This is a huge health hazard to your baby. We checked the battery after a couple weeks of use and saw that water went into the compartment where the batteries go. The batteries themselves had rotted and a black liquid was coming out of them. Looking at the design, it appears that theres no way the battery enclosure could be waterproof meaning not only did water go into the compartment during bathtime, some of that toxic material came out as well. Please do not buy this product. I‚Äôm shocked that it was allowed to go to market despite such an obvious flaw.",1
146,I immediately returned it. You use to have it with a lemon scent which was very pleasant.,1

Hose has a 12 year warranty. Tried to contact company but only international numbers available, page ask for email. Reluctant to send email to unknown company with only overseas address. I do not recommend using this brand of hose. Contacted by Worth Garden Sept. 6, 2018 with emails stating replacement hose would be sent. No word emailed Sept. 13, 2018 about no replacement Hose, answered they were working on it. Today Sept. 28, 2018 still no replacement Hose or email. Appears Hose is as good as Warranty. Would not recommend buying from Worth Garden.",1

166,So after finally sitting down to print some documents I found that the cartridge has bands in it. tried walking through all the instructions on cleaning it however if a state that if it doesn't work then more than likely that cartridge needs to be replaced. So it was a waste of $100 on this ink. I WONT be buying from this seller ever again,1

168,"The book was hard to keep up with as it jumped around a lot. Also the title doesn‚Äôt fit the story. The author indicated several people were infected by this alien, however left out may details on when or how it happened.

207,Feels very light and cheaply made FM radio did not even work...very unhappy with my purchase and do not recommend buying this one!!!!,1
208,"I wish I had taken a picture of the set before I sent it back. But just know that the fork tine split off and the knife had splinters on it that snagged the gauzy bag for storage. The reason I purchased this was to see how the bamboo ones differed. One good thing is that the weight of bamboo is quite a bit less than metal utensils. Couldn't comment on ""Easy To Clean"" since I didn't actually use it - afraid of splinters!",1
209,Digging tool bent the first time out in loose soil. Also the orange grip slips off.,1
210,Bought for my piano. Tuner would not pick up the top and bottom registers of piano. Also I felt there was too much variance of tuner itself when attempting tuning. Checked it against a tuner app on smart phone and many notes 5 to 10 cents off. Will send back.,1
211,"I ordered this Instant Pot Pressure Cookbook when it was on sale through Amazon. There is poor editing throughout this recipe book. Many recipes have missing steps and ingredients. There is no index, only a table of contents that is difficult to use. Even the table of contents is not alphabetized so you have to read down the entire list to find a recipe. The author assumes you already know how to use the Instant Pot. There are no reminders regarding sealing the Instant Pot lid or any other safety instructions. These instructions would have been helpful to those of us who are new to the Instant Pot.",1

213,"THE PRODUCT IS NOT CORRECT TO DESCRIPTION Ordered this item recieved incorrect five button remote that is a completely different one than the item listed. Sent for a return thinking it was a warehouse mistake, recieved the exact same incorrect keyfobs. DO NOT RECCOMMEND if looking for the item in the picture. At this point im just going to order from the dealer. *note: it will work when paired to unlock and lock but other functions as remote start and panic button will not function at all*",1
214,"REALLY needed this, so ordered two weeks ahead of needing it to take my PA to a friend's house for a party. Well, the packaging came apart and I kept getting notices that delivery was rescheduled. Only after many days was I able to determine that they just returned what's left to Amazon and cancelled the sale. ?? Why they wouldn't dispatch another one is beyond me, so I had to stack amps and EQ's on a table and buy some rubber feet to put between them so they didn't slide around. Real professional looking to have $6K in gear stacked on a table. So, it may be ok if you get one- but chances are you won't, or at least you won't get all of it like SO many reviews state. Just don't bother until Amazon realizes these need to be boxed properly.",1
215,I did not see and changes in my hair.... Maybe its not for Black or African American hair?,1
216,"I have no idea of this thing works or not. After a hour of tried to just set it to go off, I finally gave up, put in in the box and sent it right back. I read the directions over and over. Sooo confusing.",1

222,"Poorly written, not much substance, much better books on the subject",1
223,"Do not waste your money on this piece of junk! The lid doesn‚Äôt fit properly on the container and it leaks. I bought two and they both leak. I filled it with water and kept it in my car. It is too big for the cupholder because it is so bulky and hard to hold so I set it on the passengers seat next to me, But anytime it tipped over it started to slowly leak.

228,"First it claims that it has 8 hour battery life. Which it doesn‚Äôt. Has never gone longer then 2 1/2 of a hour. Not even that, it does not have any type of noise canceling. Good at phone calls but my main problem with it is that the right one always turns off and both of them are never on at the same time. When they are there on & off. Also the second day they just started making loud noises that wasn‚Äôt coming from my phone I have no idea what it was. Save you‚Äôre money buy real good quality earbuds these are no good",1
229,It worked for a week. My husband loved it. And then all of the sudden it won't charge or turn on. It just stopped working.,1

241,"My dog ,a super hyper Yorkie, wouldn't eat these. Didn't like the smell of them and probably didn't like the taste. I did manage to get them down him for 3 days to see if it would help him . The process of getting them down him was traumatic for him and me. They did not seem to have any effect on him one way or another , other than the fact that he didn't like them and didn't want to eat them. I ended up throwing them away. Money down the drain. Sorry, I can't recommend them.",1

Otherwise quality seems good.",1

280,"I have a pair of these gloves from over 10 years ago. That pair is great, you can take a razor sharp knife and run in along the palm and nothing, no cuts, to tears.. Nothing. The new ones are garbage. I took the same knife and lightly ran it across the palm and it cut all the way through the glove. You can tell they are no longer made the same. Save your money and if you bought these DO NOT TRUST them. they offer NO cut resistance at all.",1
281,It leaves white residue all over dishes! Gross!,1

Very upset.,1
286,"the massager never worked. I missed the 30 day return window, amazon refuses to assist me, so now it's going in the trash. I think they sold me a used one as it didn't even look new. I'm cancelling my amazon prime and shopping in other stores now as you can see what you are buying and it's easier to return. Also, amazon prices are no longer cheaper than in other stores.",1
287,"I bought this twice. The first time, the longest two cords stopped working within a week or two. I ordered it again and the same thing happened. By the time I contacted amazon, I missed the return window. Amazon needs to ease up on the return window for certain products and stand behind their customers.",1
288,"I love the pillow in the picture but unfortunately, mine does not look like that. The fabric is yellowish, texture looks different and the colors/ink are blotchy and running into the other colors. I uploaded pics but honestly looks worse in person.",1
289,Weak/cheap quality! The bristles are not full and very flimsy...doesn‚Äôt clean the sides well. I love the nipple cleaner.,1
290,This would be an awesome blender if the lid were made worth a dang. It's a high enough powered little blender but the lid is so cheaply made that I literally have to keep a hand towel near by to hold the lid on with and it still gets saturated. The first time we used it my 3 year old wanted to help and ended up having hot coffee sprayed all over his hands and arms.,1
291,I would give a proper review if I ever received my order but I paid for a decal and never received it. Give me my money back.,1
292,Update to my previous post. The left one stopped working a few days ago and today the right one no longer pairs to any of my devices either. Unfortunately my return window closed Feb 2nd. Very disappointed because be for them failing I really liked them.,1

295,Its very bad. It just peeled my skin but did not remove any dark spots.it made my skin very red :(,1
296,"Holes all over the dress, terrible!!!",1
297,"This probably works fine as an IR extender. I bought it on the basis of using it with a OTG breakout cable, to control the normally non-IR equipped FireTV stick. I knew this was an extender and not a USB sensor when I bought it, but seeing as the seller had told another customer confidently ""Yes, it will work with FireTV"" - I thought It'd give it a shot, if nothing else, I could call out the seller's lies. It arrived, tested it, yeah...It's just an IR extender, as expected, no USB data functionality. This is fine, it's advertised as this. What gets it 1-star is the irresponsible, inexperienced, lazy seller telling another customer that it can do what it cannot.",1
298,I read all of the reviews and thought...YAY something that will help me lose the 10 pounds I need to use. Everyone said it was great and it did nothing to help me lose and I was hardly eating anything!,1

I used it for the first time the next day to hold a fair amount of things, and while I was out I noticed this huge rip right down the middle that wasn't there before. I would have been more understanding if I had it for a few months but this was the first time I had put anything into it. I've never been more disappointed in a product before as I have with this backpack. Be very careful when considering purchasing this product.",1
301,First order delivered was missing; ordered another one and was double charged. Product is thin and pages are even thinner. Disappointing on multiple levels.,1
302,Amazon did't disclose the return policy of restock fee which is called cheating.,1
303,Was very disappointed in the quality of this oil. The smell was very unpleasant.,1
304,Not as described. The large sphere is 2in not 20 like advertised.,1
305,I enjoyed using a previous larger version of this humidifier but this model (1) is small and doesn't output much mist or meaningfully change room humidity according to an indoor humidity gauge and (2) produces very loud water gurgling and bubbling sounds that kept me awake. The older version did not have these issues.,1
306,"I bought these candle holders for my baby shower and we were unable to use them because the bolts that came with them were too big and the candle holders were too wobbly to use...this purchase was a waste of money! We tried everything, including glue, and nothing worked!! Nothing stabilized these candle holders.",1
307,Not reliable and did not chop well. Came apart with second use. Pampered Chef is my all-time favorite with Zyliss coming in second.,1
308,PINK PART CRACKED AS SOON AS I PUT MY PHONE IN THE CASE,1
309,These bulbs are not bright at all. I‚Äôd guess about 10% as bright as the 7w incandescent bulb I wanted to replace.,1
310,Tea was not in their INDIVIDUAL boxes,1
311,I am a stylist and purchased this dryer to use on clients. Within a week the medium tempature stoped working so it only shot cold air and hot air. Then about two weeks after that the hot air came out super hot. I would only recommend this for home use. It is not meant to be used multiple times,1
312,This shirt is one length all the way around. It does not drape or fall as it looks in the picture. Will be returning!,1
313,"Didn‚Äôt work at all for what I needed. Based on the pictures it looked more flexible but I broke my toe and this was so bulky. Also, I tried freezing it but it only stayed cold for a few minutes. I sent it back. Maybe would work better for a big toe.",1
314,"After 2 months 1 light or 25% of the order didn't work. Hoped they would work. Now I will have to return all 4 lights just because 1 didn't work. Seller is less than responsive. Asked me to create a movie of the issue, not sure why when it is simply clear that one doesn't light up with motion.",1
315,Defective- no longer working after 6 months,1
316,"Worked for about 6 months then just stopped working power will not turn on, speakers started going about a month before it completely went out",1
317,Very cheap a dollar store item and u can not sweep all material into pan as the edge is not beveled correctly,1
318,I never got my order,1
319,This cable is not of very good quality. It doesn‚Äôt fit right so you have to hold the connector to the port in order to work.,1
320,"A complete and utter piece of garbage. I never damaged, dropped, or neglected this device and by the end of 3 months it is no longer charging. The response time is abysmal when trying to access apps. Then, once accessed, the phone takes it upon itself to kick you OUT of the app. The screen, at times, is completely unresponsive. The memory is virtually gone with just the addition of a few basic apps. Sometimes you get a good product at a good price. Other times, you get exactly what you pay for. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.",1
321,"Fantastic belt ,love it . This is my second one , the first one was a little small but this one is perfect. I suggest you order one size bigger than your waist size.",1
322,Super awesome light My 5 year old absolutely loved this light It didn‚Äôt last long he got it for his birthday in January it‚Äôs February already has trouble with the buttons and doesn‚Äôt run bright with plug in eats up batteries even tried recharging batteries Super cool but needs improvement,1
323,The magnet in the pen fell out shortly after my grandson received it in the mail we didn't find this out until we came to visit after the 30 day return. Poorly made and pretty much useless after only one month.,1
324,"Ever since we have bought this, I have got back pain sitting on the chair. I cannot sit for more than half an hour on my computer table. I hope that I could return this and get my money back. Working from home has become a pain after buying this chair.",1

327,When i opened the package 2 of them were broken. Very disappointing,1
328,Mango butter was extremely dry upon delivery.,1
329,This dress is trash! Not even worthy of a house dress. Literally just pieces of material sewn together. Absolutely no workmanship or quality about it! DO NOT BUY!!!!,1
330,Item marked delivered but all I received was an unsealed empty bubble pack.,1
331,These bags break and have a terrible perfume smell to them. I only got them because I couldn‚Äôt get to Costco. Not worth it.,1
332,Screen didn‚Äôt work at all,1
333,Had one of these backpacks for years and time to replace it.... How disappointing the TWO zipper pulls broke less then 30 days after first use. Very disappointing the quality used to be good not anymore. I would not buy this bag or brand in the future.,1
334,Not good. Absorbs heat like memory foam.,1
335,Did not fit as advertised.,1
336,The description said 10 pound bag. There is no way this is 10 pounds. I get the 5 pound bags at the feed store and the 5 pound bag is bigger and heavier. I ordered two bags and I can lift both bags with one hand without trying.,1
337,The order was three days late (with Prime guaranteed delivery). As I bought it for Christmas present- I had to run in the last minute to Sephora to get an alternative,1
338,Cheap halogen bulbs that do not come in individual packages. 1 blew out after a day - you get what you pay for! Would not recommend.,1
339,THIS PRODUCT DID NOT SHOW UP,1
340,Did NOT fit the car we so carefully measured for. The description and sizing is all wrong. Buy larger than you actually need. Its thin and rips easily.,1

343,Pillow do not look like picture,1
344,Did not work at all.,1
345,"Thin curtains that are only good for an accent. 56"" wide is if you can stretch to maximum. Minimal light and noise reduction. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!",1
346,Never received the code,1
347,"The steel rule I received is very inaccurate, I ordered it for accurate markings. I never write negative reviews , but this rule is really bad. I checked against calipers and a rule I know is correct. It does make a fair straight edge.",1
348,When we received the scoreboard it was broken. We called for support and left our number for a call back. 3 days later no call. Terrible service!,1
349,This product is to small to even fit on my waste lining! Made in China so I assume a person that is normal in US large must be a very 3x person over there. But it is what it is!,1
350,"The adhesive is only on the edge of the screen, and did not stick in one of the corners. This makes it so my finger can't make contact with the screen, so basically I can't use that corner of my screen. There are also visible lines where the curve is in the screen protector. Just overall a poorly designed product. Don't waste your money on this one.",1
351,My child did not like at all the flavor. Texture is weird,1
352,We return the batteries and never revive a refund,1
353,The seller is not honest... The product has no date and no original box.. Bad.,1

355,Came with 2 pens missing from the box.,1
356,"I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it. First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual. Second, it doesn't come with a charger. Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer. Fine, we have lots of those around. When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out. I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges. Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed. Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning. I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later. Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...",1
357,Came with one detent ball broken,1
358,This product is not what I ordered and paid for. This was supposed to be a vintage compact mirror (peacock). Highly upset as this was a Christmas gift for my sister!!!,1
359,I have purchased Orgain products for years. I started out drinking the smooth chocolate and then switched to the vegan chocolate once that was available. I drank 1 to 2 every day. The last products I received tasted horrible. I looked at the ingredients and noticed Orgain changed the formulation. It is absolutely disgusting. Orgain has lost a long time customer.,1
360,This shirt is not long as the picture indicates. It's just below waist length. Disappointed b/c I am 5'10 and wanted to wear with leggings.,1
361,Couldnt find these at walmart so i looked on Amazon but later found them at the dollar store. These are obviously overpriced,1
362,The digital reader would not work when I took it out of the box. So now I've wasted quite a bit of money. Tried to contact seller and no response.,1

367,"This is at least the 4th hose I've tried. I had high hopes, but the metal parts are cheap and it leaks from the connector. The ""fabric??"" of the hose retains water and stays wet for hours or days depending on how hot - or not - the weather is. I do not recommend this product.",1
368,Sorry but these are a waist of money. Washed my handy one time and they come right off. I even glued them on because they were so cheep and didn‚Äôt stay when you put the ring on .,1
369,I have severe allergies and ordered them because the product info stated they were the softest handkerchief on the market. NOT soft at all...Don‚Äôt bother!,1
370,"Most worthless attempt at saving money I have ever encountered. Three of the exhaust runners either hit or miss-align the intake manifold. It took me more that 15 hours to cut and modify the runners to a point where they had an 1/8 of an inch clearance to the intake. Niw that I have everything assembled, and without touching the down pipe connections, now the downpipe is over a half inch off. To make matters worse, the connecting joint is almost too big for the flares on the downpipe and to top it all of, the supplied hardware is almost am inch and a half too short.",1
371,"I expect better of Amazon branded products. This cord remains in my car to charge my phone at the end of the day. Purchased in May 2019, dead in August 2019. That seems unreasonable to me.",1

373,It is not mush of guide.It kinda sucks I wish I wanted for the official one,1
374,"I own a Pampered Chef small scoop, but am in between residences so most of my 'stuff' is in storage. I love using these scoops while baking for perfectly portioned cookies. I looked at the OXO scoop and the Pampered Chef scoop and decided to save some money and get the OXO one - I usually have good luck with their products. Not this one. At about peanut butter cookie #30 the lever inside the scoop stopped working. I had to pry the handles apart and re-position the lever in order to do a few more, and then repeat. So... save your sanity and buy the Pampered Chef scoop. It's totally worth it!",1

379,"I did not receive this item, what steps to take to have this item verified ?",1
380,Squeaker broke playing catch in the house in less then 3 minutes. $10.00 for a broken rubber ball is a ripoff. NOT HAPPY. Most squeak toys last us months and we still have some from years ago. Not this. Broke immediately.,1
381,Horrible product! Does not glide on smoothly and consistently. Will never purchase again. Trashed.,1
382,Total waste of money. None worked. I try to inflate myself and the balloon immediately deflated so I went to a local balloon store and paid the owner blow up the others I bought the balloon still didn‚Äôt inflate...:( I totally do not recommend buying this product waste of money,1
383,Neither myself or my seven-year-old son was able to make this thing work.,1

397,Absolute garbage. Arrived defective. Does not work well at all. Terribly glitchy.,1
398,Why are you still selling an out of date version of the book. To a Ham newbie like myself it is not the easiest to figure out that this was not the current version for testing,1
399,I‚Äôve had my outdoor nest camera on my front porch for one year now. My subscription just ran out which is $100 per year. The camera is pretty useless without the subscription. When you have the subscription I can distinguish people from Pats or motion of trees blowing in the wind and sounds versus voices. Now that my subscription is over it can‚Äôt do any of those things is just notifies me anytime there‚Äôs motion and it can‚Äôt distinguish. It doesn‚Äôt even routine video for five minutes so you can go back and look and see who was on your porch because by time you receive the notification there already gone so the live feed is really ineffective unless someone hangs out in front of the camera for an extended period. So if you‚Äôre comfortable with being stuck with a subscription every year at $100 per camera then it is a decent camera but it‚Äôs useless without the subscription. I‚Äôm looking into other cameras where I don‚Äôt have to have a subscription.,1
400,Does not charge. Horrible product,1
401,Ring pops off the flange as soon as torque is applied on screws. Do not buy.,1

405,"This is a super cheap, tiny little over priced piece of junk. We returned it. Everything is terrible...the star display is barely visible, you can‚Äôt find the tiny buttons to operate the alarm...and especially turn it off when half asleep. The display doesn‚Äôt light in the dark, unless you fumble around in the dark for the back light button which only lights for a few seconds. Save your money on this one.",1

413,Item arrived barely not expired on bottle....smell and taste like SHIT! not like watermelon mint for damn sure. ive had a million protein shakes and this is by far the worst. i dont even think it tastes the way it initially did when it came in fresh out the assembly. Last but not least was the only product that didnt allow me to return the item although i was able to return other products from this seller. Long story short the seller had to of know this was garbage and blocked the acceptance of returns so i had to call amazon to get this resolved. you get 1 start,1
414,"The plastic film is very flimsy. The right side always rips no matter how carefully you peel it. For some weird reason, the left side doesn't have this issue. Definitely not the same quality as the photo albums from years ago. I'm returning this.",1

422,Product was not as described. Foldable metal spoon was missing despite ordering for the 4 pcs Thermos with it,1

I tried it on anyway once again I thought after wash this may change. Well it felt heavy on and it has no shape. This is not breathable fabric at all. So I did not wash it repackaged it and sent it back. I bought it to hang around the water park or beach with the kids as a cover up. Nope,1
451,"The product did not work properly, after having it installed the check engine light came back on",1
452,"These are mediocre at best. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend, they don‚Äôt look that nice as the picture shows. Looks like a computer print ironed onto a burlap sack. Get what you pay for I guess. It‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll use them for garbage bags",1

458,I love the cologne of it ever is actually delivered. They said it arrived 2 weeks ago and that I have to pick it up? Then what is the point of using Amazon is I still have to go pick it up. Amazon you are slipping so bad lately!,1

466,"This product is very small. The pictures are very deceptive and although I haven‚Äôt used them yet, I‚Äôm beginning to think this was a rip off because the price should be less due to the very small size of these. They‚Äôre only as wide as my pinky finger and as long as my index finger.",1

478,The small wrench was worthless. Ended up having to buy a new blender.,1

482,"Only a couple weeks after mounting using the included adhesive, the mount gave out and dropped my Rift ruining the display. The included adhesive is not strong enough, and while I planned to mount using the included screws in the near future, I figured the adhesive would hold until my room was ready for the permanent mount. It was not and gave out in the middle of the night. Very frustrated right now and I wouldn't complain if no adhesive was included but instead an adhesive too weak for the job is, making it too easy for this to happen.",1

The middle metal clasp that attaches to the watch is extremely loose. The entire clasp that slides into the watch is also loose and wiggles.

558,It smokes and doesn't do well with thicker meats,1
559,"We bought this for the size and comfort after my husbands knee replacement surgery. On the 3rd day of using it, there is a scorched/burned out spot in the center of the pad! Terrifying that it almost caught on fire!! Don‚Äôt know how to go about reporting this...",1
560,There are terrible! One sock is shorter and tighter than the other. The colors look faded when you put them on. These suck,1
561,Did not fit very well,1
562,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!! I bought it to transfer VHS video to computer as it was advertised to do well. 1) There was nearly no color in my recordings when using this converter. I confirmed it was the converter by directly watching the VHS recording directly on a TV using the same composite outputs, 2) The software is way outdated (9 years in fact), 3) The product cannot be returned. Don't waste your money or your time !!!!!!!!!",1
563,This phone is not worth it.. the color is washed and the storage is minimal. When I first rcvd the Phone tge charger that came with it did not work so I had to purchase a new charger. Never again will I purchase from third party again. They refused to give me my money back and AMAZON wasn't much help..Sucks,1
564,I thought this would fill cracks but the material is water thin like paint. It's also very yellow. This product is ineligible for a return so I could not recommend buying it.,1
565,Paid $25 for 14oz and received an 8oz bottle. Clearly they were hoping I wouldn‚Äôt notice? Careless and frustrating. I needed by a certain date and will now have to return it because the product is WRONG. Ridiculous mistake.,1
566,"When the case is on my phone, my sound gets muffled and the caller can‚Äôt hear me at all.",1
567,"Assembled the unit, tried to use it. The 42mm nor the 40mm Apple 4 watches fit on the stand. There was not enough clearance at the bottom for them to align with the charger. Super bummed, am returning.",1
568,I received this and it was a piece of thin wood with a picture that was glued on crooked and a thin piece of wire.... sent back ( as instructed) and cannot seem to get seller to even answer that they received the return or anything about my credit!!! Told them to keep money if they needed it that bad.... the only reason for the 1 Star is I wouldn‚Äôt be able to let others know about product and seller.,1
569,These are painful to use,1
570,Missing the 4 reality cards??,1
571,"buttons are hard to push display start to change color the lower side of the scale is not uniform (straight), when putting it on a level surface it's shaking hence when brewing espresso it's not showing the accurate measurement",1
572,I order hot pink. Look at that. That's red. But label is hot pink No return? Omg!!!!!,1
573,bought this to put on my chevy with r12 system but it did not fit,1
574,came with the threads not tapped all the way for barrel nut. the handles seem sturdy enough but very poor quality.,1
575,"The handle keeps coming apart when you use the brush. The pieces don‚Äôt screw in, more like they are made to push in. But the inserts don‚Äôt seem to be made to keep the pieces together.",1
576,Didn‚Äôt work for me. Did not fit.,1
577,Total crap wouldn't even plug into the phone the pins were bent before I even tried to use it,1
578,It was great until it ripped after 3 uses.,1
579,"Not even good, this screen protector was a joke; the lgv30 have a screen curve around the side and this not even cover it. It peel of easily. Wasted.",1
580,Product doest work at all anymore.,1
581,The case seems to be doing a decent job of protecting my phone but it is not very well made. It is difficult to take off and put back on. Overall feels like cheap construction. The kickstand is awful to work with. Once it's open and locked open you have to find the perfect way to close it or it doesn't work. Fingerprint sensor ends up awkwardly deep because the case adds about a quarter inch of thickness to the back. Overall very dissatisfied with this case,1
582,"This watch was purchased in mid-June. Not even 2 months later it's losing 45 minutes every 4 hours. The indicator boasts a ""full charge"" but still, losing >10 minutes every hour - faulty. Amazon's customer service was A COMPLETE JOKE. I was on the line for over ten minutes (probably longer but my watch runs slow), and got nowhere. Out of warranty.",1
583,I did not receive the dress I ordered,1
584,"I like heat but this is a little ridiculous. It is all heat, no ranch flavor at all. Even cutting it with normal ranch the taste is way off.",1
585,I never received this and I was need to go to the store to buy a replacement,1
586,I bought 2 and both remotes stopped working first 5 min of useing them,1
587,Not what I expected at all. It's very heavy and uncomfortable. It's like resting my head on a block,1
588,"I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.",1
589,I hate when I receive a product and it has that notice that tells me it causes cancer in the state of California. Absolutely not. Right into the garbage it went.,1
590,"Cheap, don‚Äôt work. Very dim. Not worth the money.",1
591,Did not receive it yet. Was unaware it was being shipped from China.,1
592,All of the boards came damaged.,1
593,Most were sour and dry. I ended up throwing most of them out. Don‚Äôt know if I just got a bad bag but I‚Äôm afraid to try again.,1
594,This item runs extremely small.,1
595,"What I received with this product was a fancy bottle of BROWN WATER that had a extremely slight scent of vanilla and NO VANILLA TASTE! It tastes like plain water. I tried working with the company as well as Amazon and the company REFUSED to allow a return of this disgraceful excuse for vanilla extract. I would not recommend Blue Cattle Truck in the future for any product. This is absolutely ridiculous that a company would not stand behind its product. So, now I have a $36 bottle of brown water to stand on a shelf and remind me that I was taken advantage of. I would rate the product a ""0"" but it won't allow anything less than one. Thanks a lot, Blue Cattle Truck.",1
596,I don‚Äôt see how this brush made any difference to styling my hair. It‚Äôs just a hair brush. Not sure what the hype is about.,1
597,"Does not stay in place, color is very pale!",1
598,"As other customer's commented, this shoe does tear apart. Bought them in August for my son who is a cook and he had to throw them out yesterday. The pictures are accurate, they tear on the sides. This shoe won't hold up if you work in food service.",1
599,The ball is so hard to put together and when you do it pops off instantly you are better off buying a real hamster ball,1
600,I didn‚Äôt even want to give this 1 star! This is a piece of JUNK! Terrible made! I am having. Such a HARD TIME RETURNING THIS PRODUCT! Don‚Äôt WASTE YOUR MONEY. It looks like these toys were made for a doll house. Wrongly advertised!,1
601,Had this product for a little over a week and it stopped working. Never did work when you placed the phone sideways in it...super picky on placement when the phone is upright. Very upset that it doesn‚Äôt work after a week of use...DO NOT BUY!,1
602,"Had this bowl for only 3 months and used it only 6 times when it cracked. I was washing it by hand and heard it crack. This is not a durable product. Perhaps the bowl is too big and makes it weak. I'm going back to glass for my ""go to"" large Mixing bowl- not fancy but durable!",1
603,Arrived with a missing bolt...,1
604,This stopped working adter a minth. Would not recommend at all.,1
605,Love the product but one was broken in box and left a awful mess.,1
606,"I ordered this phone for my daughter and the ""unlocked dual phone "" is misleading as it came LOCKED & in Chinese!üò°",1
607,"Won‚Äôt pull dents out, once pressure is applied, the tool just pops off. Glue that does stick to the car is a pain to get off, will even pull off paint. This this is worthless.",1
608,"I ordered these screw drivers to remove screw links from my watch. The driver heads just spin in the driver handle without budging the tiny screw. I tried tightening the set screw in the driver handle, but the blade just keep spinning. I cannot recommend buying this driver set.",1
609,Although I love the case. It is not functional for me. If you turn the case on the side all the oils fall out of place. The purpose of me purchasing this case is so that I could take my oils with me.,1
610,I was very unhappy with the delivery - I ordered this on December 11 and was supposed to get this before Christmas since it was a Christmas present for my niece and it did not arrive until after Christmas which was very unfortunate.,1
611,"Worst cable I have had to date for my iphone. It's so stiff if you move it at all while plugged in, it disconnects. I have to carefully plug it in all the way and it doesn't give that really solid click feel, then if disturbed at all it loses connection. I have another Anker Powerline 1 cable and it has been great. Not sure how the II can go backwards. My window to return has closed so I guess I'll contact them directly and see if they will replace with a different cable.",1
612,Not worth it. Looks like a cartoon Jean painted on leggings.,1
613,Came all withered no saving,1
614,Never Received this hot little item,1
615,Product came broken. The bottom plastic piece looked like it was dropped and was broken on the corner. It taken more time to be returned and replaced so no I have to tape and glue it?!?,1
616,The book was damaged. There was a deep scratch on the comer and wat looks like sticker damage. This was supose to be a gift and now I can't git it to my niece,1
617,Does not fit average tv,1
618,"This is our 4th automatic kwikset lock. Not sure what is going on during manufacturing but they work well for a while then all of a sudden the lock just stops working; beeps for no reason, the keypad doesnt respond when the code is pressed and it randomly goes through a series of locking and unlocking without being triggered. I wish I could return this and get my money back. We replaced the batteries before going on vacation, our pet sitter called us to come home because the lock would not respond when she entered the code. We had to come home from vacation to make sure our dogs were ok! Dangerous and a piece of junk!",1
619,"Clumpy, creases on my lips, patchy, all in all not worth it. Have to scrub my lips nearly off with makeup remover to get it all off.",1
620,Not sure but I don't think the infrared light last as long as the regular ones do. Only lasted me a little over a year. I'm not sure how long the warranty is or how to get a replacement.,1
621,We bought this for light rain for our kids birthday party and it collapsed! Luckily no one was hurt! Then seller wanted me to return the 100lb product and somehow get bent poles in a box and I would have to pay for the return shipping!!!,1
622,"Shines dimly. broke on next day! Awful, terrible quality. Price is higher than any other. Do not waste time and money on this!",1
623,"Stop using Amazon Delivery Drivers, they are incompetent and continually damage packages",1
624,"This product should not even be sold on Amazon. It‚Äôs flimsy, cheap and there are no stakes to assemble it properly to set up in yard.",1
625,The tablet had a slow reaction time. I would touch the screen and the page or item would take at least 2 to 3 seconds to work.,1
626,Got a screen didn‚Äôt worked reorder it and still didn‚Äôt work trash screen,1
627,Very poor quality. This broke after one business trip(soft crushable plastic). The digital screen went black and the disc spins but nothing comes out. The sonic quality is also poor although it has EQ options. I miss my old Sony original from 1991. This isn‚Äôt even close.,1
628,"This fabric was so disappointing and it looked completely different in person, it's not rose gold and its dull. How can sequins be dull, it's an oxymoron!!",1
629,Do not waste your money on this product! The tie mechanism is defective.,1
630,"Shocked when I opened the box to find that the tool was broken, most of the attachments were completely used up or broken. This thing looked like it had been used for years, then put back into the box, sawdust and all then shipped to me. Check out the pictures! I'm sure it's a great tool, but I'll never know...",1
631,"did not work, spit out fog oil ,must have got a bad one",1
632,Not the best product for the money,1
633,"I used it only twice and when the sidewalk ended, it went out and didn't turn on anymore. I did not buy it. Do not throw your money",1
634,"The water didn't get very hot and ran through quickly, making a weak cup of coffee. After having it a little more than a month, only half of the water would go through, basically making a mini cup of weak coffee. Amazon said we had it more than a month so we would have to contact the company. The company said it was still under warrantee but we would have to pay $11 shipping and handling to get a new one. $11 is a lot of money considering we don't know if the second one will break after a short time. So now we have a $40 piece of garbage and will be replacing it with a different brand. Very dissatisfied!",1
635,"Wrong color suspension and quality compared to picture. Picture shows different suspension, color. Very disappointed.",1
636,Arrived frozen solid. Been in the house for 2 hours and still frozen. Brought into house 7 min after delivered. Probably ruined. Suspect package was in delivery vehicle overnight. Waste of money.,1
637,Cheap material. Broke after a couple month of usage and I emailed the company about it and never got a response. There are much better phone cases out there so don't waste your time with this one.,1
638,"I put this on my nose as directed twice a day rubbing it in for 2 minutes. The skin on my nose reddened and went completely raw. I was pretty taken aback. I had a well healed scar from falling into barb wire from years ago. Not only did this product not work but I almost ended up at the dermatologist's office, however, putting aqua-for and a bandaid over the area finally calmed it down after about a week. My nose is still reddened however but hoping this goes away soon.",1
639,Bought this gauge half way worked. It would freeze and then drop real fast. I turned key off and back on and it would show different readings. The sender was good. I bought a sierra and works like a charm.,1
640,"These are terrible, threw mine in the garbage. Every couple of songs it makes a skipping sound like a CD player and you have to turn off and back on the headphones to make it stop. Dont waste your money on these.",1
641,Totally got scammed. Worked for 10min. Thanks,1
642,I bought this for my sons birthday party and one hour into it I noticed a tear in the back of his shirt where his arm is. I was so embarrassed when someone asked me about it and had to change him midway through his party. It was brand new never been used and tore within an hour.,1
643,"One of them worked, the other one didn't. There's no apparent damage, it just won't work on multiple phones and with multiple wall ports.",1
644,The antiglare is just a low quality opaque piece of plastic. hard to see thru it,1
645,"I am unable to use these on any of my doors! They do not fit. My doors have frames, and the doors in the pictures do not have them. Will never use these.",1
646,It is a horrible book.,1
647,These are not soft or flexible on the ear at all! Worried I will damage my ear using them and they don't work to massage the ear as it says either!,1
648,Poor quality screw base. Not made to US specs for standard household bulbs.,1
649,Did not receive I want a refund,1
650,cheap quality doesnt work,1
651,The glow powder claims to be kiln fired in; that‚Äôs a LIE. The glow powder came off onto EVERYTHING in the fish tanks. One betta Fish survived the trauma. The other one died shortly after this chaos.,1
652,"The band was clunky and uncomfortable to begin with. I managed to alter it to fit, however it remained awkward and too large. I should have ordered something less masculine. I was managing, though. Until about three weeks in, when the band completely broke. One component of the band apparently simply fell out, and the band fell to pieces. I was disappointed.",1
653,Worst product I‚Äôve bought,1
654,I think it was an Out of the Box Failure. Too cheap to send back. Solved my problem another way.,1
655,"Product was diluted!!! I had used this as a hand soap at a friends house and REALLY liked it. She‚Äôd purchased her bottle from homegoods. So I ordered mine on Amazon. I was so totally disappointed and felt a little insulted. The package and scent were as I remembered and liked, but the product was DEFINITELY watered down. Felt like what you‚Äôd do to dish soap when you come to the end and you rinse the bottle out to get the last drop. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Maybe try another seller if you like this soap!!",1
656,Not worth your time. PASS.,1
657,Was not as advertised. Is not 6‚Äù insertable.,1
658,"The faucet worked well for the first 3-6 months it was installed but them developed a pin-hole leak in the hose (the main part of the faucet). We contacted the seller and they said they would send a replacement part but sent sprayer head. We have tried several more times to contact them but they will not respond. Now we have been 2-3 months without a faucet for our island sink. The lifetime warranty is false! Go with Delta, Kohler, Moen or any other brand that stands behind their product. Terrible!",1
659,"Was really looking forward to this product due to the reviews but when the package arrived, the jar was in pieces and marmalade was everywhere. They didn‚Äôt even put the product in a box; just the standard amazon shipping package. Disappointed",1
660,"Absolutely no protection on the phone, flimsy plastic material, terrible quality. This is the bulkiest case I have ever held and it only fits two cards at maximum - no squeezing a third at all. Very expensive and obviously cost very little to produce. Stay away~!",1
661,I never got my order... Definitely the worst saler on Amazon.,1
662,DON'T!!! Mine stopped playing 3 days after return deadline ended.,1
663,Almost all of the packages were hard to chew so I didn't bother opening the rest :(,1
664,I dislike this product it didnt hold water came smash in a bag and i just thow it in the trash,1
665,Very poor material brooke in two days. Not worthy. What a waste and my daughter was looking forward to that.,1
666,"they're super cute.... but not durable at all. took them out of the packaging and already flowers were falling off. put batteries in them and it was only a week or two before the lights altogether stopped working (and no, it wasn't because the batteries ran out of juice).",1
667,Arrived completely melted! Would not recommend!,1
668,It was great the first few weeks. Now the bag is falling apart. Received august 20. Today is october 2 and bag is now coming apart . Only ever had 1 racket and 1 pair of shoes kept in there. Still looks new. *Zipper broke *Handle broke *Ripped near zipper area can't close.,1
669,Only lasted 2 months!,1
670,"Doesn‚Äôt work! You can hear the battery moving back and forth and it feels cheaply made, wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone would actually tell them not to buy from them.",1
671,The closures seems like they would open unintentionally very easily. They don't seem to seal well.,1
672,"Product does not include instructions, but turning the shaft changes the frequency. Does nothing to quiet the dog next door, but when I blow it in the house, my wife barks.",1
673,"I purchased this headset for my grandson on March 12, 2018. They stopped working on March 26, 2018. He could hear the person on the other end but they were unable to hear him.",1
674,I opened my package to discover it had opened and spilled everywhere! I went to return the item as defective and found out it isn‚Äôt returnable. Now I have 3 lbs of gum balls I have to throw out because I have no idea on how sanitary the boxes are and where they have been.,1
675,Not very happy with this product. Upon opening the package I was hit with an unpleasant chemical smell. Had to air it out for a couple of hours before I let my daughter play with it. She's only had it for a total of 3 days and it's already torn at the neck seam. The black of the penguin smudges to the white. Definitely not worth $8.,1
676,This did not work AT ALL on my puffy under eye. I promptly returned it.,1
677,These are beautiful glasses. We ordered them specifically to drink gin drinks. They are the perfect size and look really classy. We used them a couple of times and hand washed them each time. The third time I hand washed them and the bowl part of one of them totally shattered in my hand while I was drying it. I was really careful with them but still this happened. Such a shame. Really liked them until that happened. I was going to order more but I'm nervous the same thing will happen again.,1
678,None of them worked.,1
679,"It‚Äôs disappointing opening the box getting excited to see your package arrive, only to find that only 4 sets were delivered not the 6 you were promised.",1
680,Each one I put on bubbled,1
681,"Although this is a work of fiction, I am troubled that the theology would give someone a very wrong idea of Christianity. I was so worried about leading someone astray that, for the first time in my life, I trashed a book rather than reselling or giving it away. This is fiction, this is fiction, this is fiction.",1
682,"These are very fragile. I have a cat who is a bit rambunctious and sometimes knocks my phone off my nightstand while it's plugged in. He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that. I'm sure they're fine if you're very careful with them, but if whatever you're charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.",1
683,The connect to the phone basically fail and the case would not reliably charge the phone within 4 months. Tried contacting the seller and received no response. I would NOT recommend the product .,1
684,The belt started to slip after a month,1
685,I tried these with 2 two different pens. The ink does not flow and the cartridge dries out after a few days.,1
686,Book was a mess when I got it. Returned it the next day and was only refunded 1/3 of what I paid!!!!,1
687,Yeah it‚Äôs great to have a remote for PS Vue but every time you go to use it you have to press either the TV or PS4 button. More irritating than helpful. Such a buzz kill.,1
688,Waste of money smfh sooo upset,1
689,"This movie took to long to get to the point. A lot of nothing happens for an hour, by that time I was bored.",1
690,"Don't waste your money, much too thin to protect your phone",1
691,my problem with the product is the fit. I have a large head and it is too tight everywhere and the neck just doesnt feel right. I want to pull it down but then my nose has no room. I can't use it because of the poor fit.,1
692,"I had to return them. They said they worked to recharge dog bark collars, but neither cord plugged into different USB outlets charged the collar.",1
693,This is a poorly made piece that was falling apart as we assembled it - some of the elements looked closer to cardboard than any wood you can imagine. I can foresee that it will be donated or thrown away in the next few months or even weeks.,1
694,"Yeah, that's about it. The nipple pieces are so tiny that at best, they are fit for feeding baby mice or maybe baby gerbils. I can't use them for my two little, five week old puppies. They weigh 1.3 and 1.5 pounds respectively, and this teensy nipple is too small that they would even recognize this as something from which to suckle. Other use I can think of for these would be a 5 - 10 year old girl, who wants to bottle feed her dolls. She would love these! I can't imagine how the makers can claim that all professional nurses use them for new born animals. I don't believe it! I am going to buy some real baby bottles with some real nipples.",1
695,Only used for a week,1
696,This is crap. Very thin. Lasted one day,1
697,Warped. Does not sit flat on desk.,1
698,Upsetting...these only work if you have a thin phone and or no phone case at all. I'm not going to take my phone's case (which isn't thick) off Everytime I want to use the stand. Wast of money. Don't buy if you use a phone case to protect your phone it's too thin.,1
699,The description of this product indicated that it would have a cosmetic flaw only. This pendant is missing the socket. There is no place to put the light bulb.,1
700,"why give me a date for a month then when its suppose to ship, its running late",1
701,"I purchased this to replace the screen on my friend‚Äôs 6s plus. I‚Äôve replaced numerous iPhone screens in the past. This one, as soon as I powered on the phone, had a cluster of dead pixels in the middle of the display. Also, the home button was completely non-functional. I‚Äôm not just talking about TouchID. I mean the home button was completely dead. I tried moving a functional home button to the new display and it didn‚Äôt work either so there was obviously an issue with something in the replacement part. Fortunately, Amazon offered me a refund so I‚Äôve purchased a different replacement part that will hopefully work better.",1
702,Started falling apart in three months.,1
703,"When using the bag for the first time, when it comes down from the baggage conveyor, the baggage handler packs the entire bag in a plastic bag. The zipper between the bottom compartment and the top has been separated. Fortunately I didn't lose anything. But I have to buy a new suitcase for my next trip. By the way, the weight when filling is 23 pounds. Therefore, I did not overfill it.",1
704,I canceled this order and reordered using a different mailing address because this was a gift and it came to my address and does not have a packaging slip where I can send it back....disappointed. Also the mailing envelope it came in was torn in two places.,1
705,Definitely not what I expected! Now to say this I usually use the Doc Johnson Seven Wonders vibrator which is awesome I think they stop making it so I had to find an alternative so I found this one the price was decent read the reviews you know looked at everybody else reviews and base it off of that so hey I ordered okay so I had it for a few weeks now wanted to give an honest review and honestly... I hate it I think it's more or less the design of the applicator I don't really like the fatness of it I really like to sleep slim ones that to me they really stimulate your clit a whole lot better but hey that's just my opinion I went by it again that we looking for alternative hope this helps anybody on the quest to find a good bullet LOL LOL,1
706,"Arrived busted in 2 corners and the box was ripped, looked like they were reselling a returned product.",1
707,never received my order,1
708,The screen protector moves around and doesn't stick so it pops off or slides around,1

712,Ordered this for a Santa present and Christmas Eve noticed it came broken!,1
713,"Garbage. Shipped damaged. When I tried to return it they wanted me to pay for the return shipping. Currently dealing with amazon customer service - which is my first attempt in years, and even they are making it hard. Apparently this is the 3rd party seller - so amazon customer service doesn‚Äôt apply. Wow. Sadly I paid amazon.",1
714,Did nothing and was nothing,1
715,These flavors are blah! I‚Äôve had these same flavors from different brands and enjoyed them but these are gross.,1
716,I ordered Copic Bold Primaries and got Copic Ciao Rainbow instead. Amazon gave me a full refund but still annoying to have to reorder and hopefully get the right item.,1
717,One of the 5 cords received is already broken. The other 4 have hardly been used. The one that‚Äôs broken has only been used moderately and it already stopped charging.,1
718,Do not order from this vendor. They sent me the incorrect size twice. Too expensive to have such dismal attention to detail.,1
719,Worst iPhone charger ever. The charger head broke after used for 5 Times. Terrible quality.,1
720,"I followed the instructions but the chalk goes on gritty and chunky, and looks nothing like the photos. A giant waste.",1
721,It did not work when I received it the packaging was all wet I'm not sure how it got that way but it must have been in transit because it was delivered inside and picked up immediately as we really needed it for our RV. I ordered one from a different supplier and the unit works well but the one I received from Amazon never worked,1
722,"The first night of using this air conditioner it stopped working (in the middle of the night) and the red light went on, indicating that the water tank is full. I removed 3 buckets of water (on the 1st night of operation!). After turning it on, AC stopped working in 1 hour again!!! And I removed 1 bucket of water again!!! So going forward, the AC stopped working every single hour. From what I see this AC has a totally faulty water evaporation system. Don't tell me that the company is not aware of it! This AC should be removed from production and sales and faulty system corrected. For $500 I got myself a trash and a headache, instead of peace and calm and comfortable nights what I was hoping for. If you ever think about this crap, you have been warned.",1

728,If does not always work for some reason.,1

730,"Recieved the item with obviously re-closed packaging. Box was scuffed & dirty on outside and small dark marking on the actual thermometer. Then, once I downloaded the app, created my account, confirmed account via email, I still couldn't even log into the app to use the product. Pointless!",1
731,Took a chance on a warehouse deal and lost. It said like new minor cosmetic on front turned out to be stickers on front and a broken speaker Connection in the back making Channel 1 useless.,1
732,relieved itching in ear for a few seconds.,1
733,Glass was broken had to ship it back waiting on the new one to be here tomorrow hopefully not not broken.,1

737,Brought this as an Christmas gift for my son. Assembly was pretty easy I liked how sturdy the materials were. However it stopped working the first day he played with it. Was very disappointed because the cars on the track would stop moving and it was times when they would get off track. I would not recommend this product at all.,1
738,It was working fine for the first 3 months after purchased. But after that I need to change battery every month and now it does not dispense any more soap. That is a design flaw where the soap will dry up and block the soap dispense hole.,1
739,Product was never received. Seller contacted and still no product.,1
740,I was so happy I finally found venison and elk sausage well what a disappointment. Save your money they all taste the same and it is not a lot of taste either would not even pay 2 dollars each for these,1
741,BINDING FALLS APART: Throw it away!! I cannot imagine why they would bother to produce such a poor quality product for such HARD WORKING professionals!! This book is used every day- almost every hour. It fell apart instantly with use the first week. so sad...,1

755,"I know this tracker is several years old and the technology has improved a lot since then, so I was really not expecting much. I just needed a simple step tracker that clips onto my clothing and syncs with my phone, and the price was incredibly low so I figured why not. I received this tracker on Friday, and by Monday it has stopped syncing with my phone. It worked for 2 days. I have tried troubleshooting this error but cannot fix the problem. I don't know if its the app or the tracker, but either way it was a waste. I also felt like it was not counting enough steps when it was working. Fortunately I ended up getting it for free due to a delivery error, but I'm still annoyed that it is such a piece of garbage.",1
756,I like this swim suit but it fits really small. I am a size 14 and per reviews that's what I ordered. It runs really small. Also a lot of mesh in the back and on the sides of this suit. Don't like that. its going back....sad,1
757,Tip broke after a few weeks of use.,1
758,One of them broke as soon as it was opened.,1
759,This rice is from the ice age. It tastes ghastly and revolting. I threw the rest away and I'm sure not even the ants will like it. It seems to be leftovers from Neanderthals which might add some archeological value to it.,1
760,"The speaker has a great sound and size is perfect for traveling. after around 6 months the speaker drops connection constantly and cannot be returned. it is not a cheap device and the brand is known for quality in general, but very disappointed now.",1
761,"This was not like the name brand polymer clays I am used to working with. This is much to plasticky feeling, hard to work with, it won‚Äôt soften up even the slightest bit with the heat from my hands like the name brand polymers. It was difficult to mold, roll, and impossible to create anything halfway decent looking. This is certainly a case of ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù Stick to the name brand if you want this for anything other than for a kid to mess around with. I am highly disappointed in everything except for the case it came in.",1
762,Charging port broke when I got it out of the box to charge it. It pushed inside and no way to get it out. Waste of time.,1

765,Very fake looking. I sent back.,1

768,"Other reviews have claimed that this product has failed after a short period of time, and this was my experience as well. Mine no longer responds to X10 commands or the on/off buttons after less than 6 months. I requested a repair or replacement from Texas Home Automation (the Amazon seller), but they informed me that it was past the 120 day warranty period.",1
769,Plates won‚Äôt snap in. The keep falling out no master how hard you push. Leaks every where. Handle won‚Äôt snap shut. It‚Äôs good difficult to use. It‚Äôs not like my d sandwich maker I used in college. Only reason I wanted another one-the simple ease of making sandwiches. But this is more headache than worth it. I‚Äôm cleaning the mess it‚Äôs made.,1
770,The time display stopped working after 3 months. Can now see only bottom half of numbers. Don't buy.,1
771,It will not turn on. It was a gift and the person called and said it does not work. It won't turn on. I would like to send back and get either another or my money back.,1
772,I should've checked reviews before buying these headphones. They barely lasted 2 weeks compared to my original android headphones which lasted me close to two years before one ear died. DO NOT BUY,1
773,"The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and ""Make sure it is securely in place."" HOW??? It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind. You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it. It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug. It is a complete PITA. I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards. (Let's face it; there's nothing like this which will actually ""baffle"" squirrels!)",1
774,Doesn‚Äôt look anything like the case.. brought for a gift and I don‚Äôt even want to give it to her,1

776,Did not seem to slow mice down. Plugged them in and mice still kept coming. Did absolutely nothing to stop,1
777,"I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED THIS PRODUCT BUT THE RETURN WINDOW RAN OUT. The liner comes folded and does not lay flat. I thought that if I left it out, the material would eventually relax and become flat. It has been out a week and it I still all rippled. Why would the manufacturer not ship it in a tube or wrapped around a tube!!!! This liner is useless. What a joke. Do not buy.",1
778,"Not only was the product poorly packaged, it did not work and made a horrible grinding noise when turned on. To make matters worse, I followed ALL return instructions and still have not been issued my refund! Would give zero stars if I could.",1
779,"The battery life is terrible compared to earlier versions, an all day reading episode uses it up. It is not something I could count on for a long trip without power nearby. Also, it often goes back several pages quickly because my hand gets near the left edge. I regret buying this version.",1
780,They have no clue what there even doing waste of money.,1
781,This paper I believe is a replacement for a glossy cannon paper I used to buy. This paper isn't as heavy as the previous edition and won't stay straight in my Canon pro-100 printer.,1

792,"Cheap material/fabric. Won't survive one wash. Asian size that will only fit a Doll not a Human. Once again sellers are Amazon listing clothes as American sizes but not referencing that the product is from China or Asian Country. Don;t buy this, you will be wasting your time to mail it back.",1
793,"I bought the tie-dyed version and it was SO comfortable. Stretchy breathable material. I decided to buy the black version for work. Bad decision! The material is completely different. It doesn‚Äôt stretch, it‚Äôs not breathable and it is very small and uncomfortable! It even seems it‚Äôs stitched differently so that it coveres 50% less of my head. So disappointing!!",1
794,The cords are too short. It stopped working after less than 2 weeks.,1
795,"Product arrived with scratches on it prior to even removing it from its packaging, then when I tried to use it there was no connection. This spliter does not do what it is intended to do. Interesting that all of the 5 star reviews are from unverified purchases.. ü§î",1

804,i never received my package but it shows it was delivered.,1
805,The cover felt soft enough after washing. I followed directions exactly as stated. It leaked the first night and every night since. I am disappointed. It is a good thing that I used a different cover underneath it just in case.,1
806,No space bag alot smaller than it looks in picture,1
807,Did not come with the wand,1
808,This thing is angled the wrong way. It makes you bend your wrist up in an unnatural position which is very fatiguing. Sent it back after using for less than an hour.,1
809,This printer is horrible. It's way too complicated and is constantly giving error messages. The printer drawer and output drawers are very cheaply made. We've had this printer for less than 6 months and have only been able to print many 5 items since it's constantly giving us a new error message. Once we try to correct the error message by doing exactly what it states it gives us the same error. Very frustrating.,1

We mixed the product as recommended on the container. The product was very hard to use it was very sticky. Then it became like a real glue after half hour as shown in the figure above.. The seller told us that you must leave the lid open after you mix it which was not on the instruction. This does not make a sense. We believe that we have received an old product which was sitting in the shelf for more than a year. The shelf life of the product is one year. The shelf life of the oriduct was missing on the container. There was no date on the container when it was made, and when it expire. This is very important. We have filed a dispute against the seller.",1

813,I like it is solid and also easy to apply on my baby. Also the ingredients are organic and natural. However after I start using them. I realized it have something hard plastic SHARP in the middle of the stick!! I almost make a big scratch on my baby's face! The design of this stick is TERRIBLE!,1

817,"Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don't purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.",1

836,"This product is great when it works, which is RARELY. We have attempted to record multiple soccer games and lacrosse games and have ended up with some videos of the grass, a bunch of 0 byte video clips on the card, and that is about it. For a $700 product I would expect it to work. The memory card is one of their suggested cards, and we have applied all the product updates that were available. We have used it for streaming which worked, but that would be all I would recommend it for at this point. We have other friends that have them and all have had issues with theirs as well. Nothing like thinking you are recording your kids playing sports to come home and have NOTHING.",1

849,"Well, the mother card came damaged and I can not return it because I'm from another country and the cost of sending the package is greater than the price of the card, so it's not worth it. The card is beautiful and comes well packaged, but unfortunately it came damaged from the factory, it does not turn on or the LED lights that it has on the part of the external connectors. The criticism is for those people who buy the items internationally, bear in mind that they can lose their money if it is damaged and the cost of returning it to amazon is much higher than the price of the item.",1

891,"I bought this modem/router about two years ago. At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I‚Äôve had problems with it dropping the internet. This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It‚Äôs fantastic. I‚Äôv Had it for over a week with no problems. It‚Äôs faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast. If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router. Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.",1
892,"let me start off by saying this is not a bad rating for the product but rather Amazon for not delivering on time. So my order was over 8 days ago and Amazon barely shipped my package. All I received was an email indicating that the package would be late. The website continues to indicate that there were 15 miter saws still in stock. So when I get the shipping email, it moves the date by 5 additional days. No effort to ship over night or provide a more expeditious delivery what so ever. how can anyone even consider buying here for black Friday or Christmas. Amazon wants to act like they are still the only option for online shopping. I could just have easily order this on homedepot or lowes or Walmart online. I could have received this same day had I gone to the store. And it is much easier to return something is there is issues with the alternatives. So why doesn't Amazon provide better service? I questioned myself, why do even shop on amazon? I suppose with the other options I won't any longer.",1

However, the magnet stuck to everything that my arm came in contact with and pulled my fit bit off, such as the refrigerator door, my office building door, the car door, etc. I have had my fitbit for over 3 years with the original band but after having the new bracelet a month, I lost it last week when it fell off somewhere between my office and th e restaurant I walked to for lunch.

I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem. Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box. I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine. It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue. Very disappointing since my return window has expired.

960,The quality is terrible. The screen was glued on crooked which gave me a crooked picture. The glare/reflection on the screen is too much for my liking. Don't let the pictures advertising it fool you. It doesn't look anything like it's being advertised. I'm sending it back.,1
961,Does not work mixed this with process solution and 000 and nothing. Looked exactly the same as i first put it on.,1

It has notches - supposedly to allow you to twist it onto the nightlight base. You‚Äôd need to be able to do that in order to replace the bulb.

983,"As per the instructions I charged the batteries fully before the first use. This took 14 hours which is much longer than the suggested three hour charge time. After the charging was complete I paired the socks with the included remote control. Pairing each battery was actually pretty easy, once of the nicest things about these socks. The socks fit my feet well. You can easily feel where the wires are but it only took a couple of minutes before you forgot they were there. Once the sock were on I connected the batteries and tucked them away in their respective pouches. The using the remote I turned the socks on High. After an hour I pulled each battery out of the pouch to check the indicator light, sure enough the light showed that each battery was on high but I couldn't feel any warmth on my feet. And this was on High. I kept the socks on for four hours, at about the third hour I started to feel a hint of heat. The reason these socks didn't meet my expectations and received a two star rating is because of the exceptionally long charge time as well as it taking three hours before I felt any hint of heat. Even at hour four there was very little heat on the High setting. I didn't test Medium or Low.",1

989,"I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus. Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it. Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and ""in the loop"" and I did. Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves. When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that. This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful. I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account. I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone. I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit. I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone. Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST. On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.",1
990,Hard to read and the colors are too bright.,1

993,"Learned the hard way not to skimp and buy remanufactured ink carts. Got the carts and installed the black one, which was what I needed. Immediately my printer got super clogged and went from printing fine to printing 1‚Äù stripes across the paper. No amount of head cleaning and alignment would fix the problem. I ended up throwing the printer away and buying the newer model which was on sale. $50 for the new printer plus the cost of this horrible ink makes for an expensive lesson.",1
994,"Initially the product worked as explained. However, after a several months the edges begin to peel up(I also have a case one it), I tried to fix it with no luck. Maybe the peeling comprised the protective material in some way because after the peeling got worse my son dropped my phone, nothing crazy just a normal drop and the phone cracked all down the left edge and ran across the screen and I have otterbox case on it as well. Next time I would buy the glass protector and deal a slightly less responsive screen (as some say happens), seems worth it to me especially now I am stuff with a cracked screen and since that one incident it was knocked out of hand and now theres a huge crack right in the middle.",1

I do not recommend this wig, if you are a new beginner with wearing wigs.",2

1007,I wish there were 2.0 version with a large canister. This only holds about 12oz coffee so it‚Äôs. It really enough to make a large one. It‚Äôs only good for one use at a time before it needs refreshing. I‚Äôve tried to fill it 2 times in a row and the second pour was extremely watery because the inside had melted and poured out the air vents on the lid,2
1008,Lasted a month and magnetic clasp wore out. It now comes apart and falls off. It‚Äôs too bad as I liked this one.,2
1009,Item is comfy and gel material. So I gave it 2 stars for comfort. But as far as straightening my hammer toe...it does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR IT. Possibly bc the material is too soft. There is no difference from having nothing on toe to when I put the little gel brace on.,2
1010,I didnt wear it alot umm maybe for 2 weeks then after it looks kinda trashy,2
1011,The bungee cord in the sticks for assembly broke after one use.,2
1012,Sitting in an office all day I needed extra support. The strap on this doesn‚Äôt secure to the chair like you would need in order to use this how you‚Äôd expect to. I had to use a giant rubber band around the top half to keep it from tipping out/forward all the time.,2

I could of lived with the thinner magnet but because the design started to peel once it was cut then it‚Äôs worthless to me. Hope this helps.",2

1023,Very thin. Not high quality but worked for the intended purpose.,2
1024,I dislike this litter. I does not clump like it should and leaves litter box a mess.,2
1025,Some of mine were dried out when I opened.Some of the colors were very light and didn't show up well.The darker colors worked the best. For the price it was a great range and selection of colors.,2

1027,"I bought this little mixer to, well, mix two audio channels to one output and have the option for a convenient headphone port on my desk. When I first hooked everything up, I had serious issues with an audio feedback buzzing constantly. I did some poking around and thought it was the cheap audio cables I purchased. I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem. It is no longer constant, but frequently pops up when I power it on. You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away. But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume. If you adjust them the feedback gets worse the further they are apart, if you have one at max and one at min - the feedback is so bad it drowns out the audio. I gave it two stars because it technically works, but a simple 2 into 1 audio connection would do the same thing and save you $30. I would not recommend this to anybody and eventually it will go in the trash.",2
1028,It's ok. Material quality is great. Seems though that it's not a wide enough material used. My wife is small. 5 foot 3 and about 135 pounds. This barely goes around her. Seems they should add about 3-5 inches of material and it would be perfect. She needs an extra clip on bottom half to avoid any free shows.,2

They are too small, although I ordered the large that was specified for my size (I wear a 6 or 8 in U.S. sizes). I can barely get them on, and I am afraid of ripping them. I will probably not wear them; not what I expected at all.",2
1036,Two Stars because what I received wasn't what you see in the picture!! In the picture theres no nose cover which is what i wanted. Instead i received the kind that cover my nose. Second the velcro doesn't adjust it has only one setting and the velcro is misplaced the harder hooked part should face away from the head not towards it. Theres nothing like a Sleep mask thats two tight and catches your hair because you tried to adjust it.,2
1037,"The book itself is beautiful but mine came in pretty bad shape. I bought it as a Christmas gift and it took almost two months to get to me, so there was no time to return it. Considering how long I waited and what I paid I was pretty disappointed in the quality. However, the book is very cool and I love Lisa's work.",2
1038,"Instead of a black one I got a white one, but at least i could return it.",2
1039,Flag itself was on point. Suction cup to secure the flag sucked.,2
1040,The bracket that links the tub with the frame was badly designed and poorly manufactured. I tried to get a replacement bracket from the seller but they said no replacement parts were available. They offered a return label or a rebate. I chose the rebate since I had thrown away the shipping box and I thought I could get the bracket fixed. The bracket was made from weak metal so repairing it is not possible. Hopefully I can find a machinist to make me one.,2
1041,"The device is nicely designed and quiet and seems to do a good job lowering allergen levels in our bedroom. However, it has one really silly design flaw - when plugged in it is always lit with an LED (red when off, blue when running). These lights are much dimmer than the night light they offer, but still much brighter than they should be for one's bedroom. I tape over the light, but it is impossible to block it out completely without also interfering with the air flow. Too bad!",2
1042,Arrived with a dent in the lid. Packaging was great so I assume it was shipped that way. Shame because other than that it is another quality Stanley product. Not worth the hassle of returning for replacement.,2
1043,This cord did not fit my Galaxy S6.,2

1051,"I got a free sample of the charcoal one at Credo Beauty and I liked it, so much I bough this scent. I know you'll go through a detox phase when using a natural deodorant, but I've been using natural deodorant for several years and it made my odor worse and I had terrible wetness too. I had to stop using this one and use Lume Deodorant, which is 1000X better.",2
1052,Rinse small. Not colorfast. Color runs even after a few washings.,2
1053,"The emblem is exactly the right size for what I wanted. However despite being packaged as a genuine Mopar product, which I suspect is counterfeit or at l least hope so, because the adhesion is terrible... it fell off twice, fortunately both times in my driveway. So I took some 3M double sided tape and using an exacto knife put the 3M on the back of the emblem. That did the trick. However it should have come that way in the 1st place if it was really a genuine Mopar emblem.",2
1054,Had to replace batteries constantly. By accident the base got wet and the dispenser did not work after even with the batteries replaced less than a year. I had to dispose of it.,2

1061,"It was a fine coffee maker for a while, but there were always issues with it. If you got water between the black plastic and metal on the carafe, it would leak and drain the water for days. Then our plastic lever broke which allows the coffee to flow through the filter and into the carafe. I contacted customer support to inquire about a new piece, but they would only refer me to a service center which is over 90 minutes from my house. It's great at making coffee and keeping it hot, but there are too many other issues with it to invest in it at the current price.",2
1062,"These were for the most part a waste of money, they do offer moderate protection but no enough to actually justify buying them. They were cut perfectly and fit well, I just don‚Äôt see any real value in them.",2

1065,"There is no adjustment on the belt loop connection and it hangs way too low on the thigh. When you've used others that are comfortable to run around with, this just feels cheap and poorly made. The plastic will probably not last with much use either. The material and velcro were robust, but the quick release velcro was not intuitive to setup. I returned this.",2
1066,The product came in a plastic bag and box but the labels were wet so I could not read them. I sprayed the product and there was very little change on the leads but it pretty much hurt all the plants.,2
1067,Just received the honey. Looks great. However the lid arrived cracked and the seal was broken! Says no way to return or exchange. How can this be?! No pun intended. Sucks!,2

1071,It was a little big/long the elastic straps on the sides of the mask. Would not stay tight to my face,2
1072,"The pillows are soft but you could basically compress it down into a medium-sized purse. They present well but there's very little in them. I like soft pillows but I'd still like to lay on a pillow. They'll flatten out to feel like you're not laying on anything at all. If you need pillows just for show, these are great, but if you want to USE them, I suggest looking elsewhere.",2

1075,Ring broke off after a week.,2
1076,"I have a big head. I admit it. I generally look for larger products for my noggin. I have a previous purchase of Gonex OTG goggles and wanted to ""shop"" and compare. The Gonex came with a great case, velvety bag, wipe cloths and were of a general higher build quality. I'm not returning the set, as my 6 year old and wife want to use them for snow this winter. Unfortunately, that wasn't the intent with the product. BE CAUTIOUS if you got a big melon!",2
1077,"complicated, bulky not easy to use. will return it and search for another brand.",2
1078,It went on very well but affected the sensitivity of my screen. It only lasted a few days before it pulled up and got caught on my case and the corner broke. Then it kept popping up and doesn't go back down well. Once off it doesn't go back on well.,2
1079,The cord pulls off and leave the tips in my ears. They're hard to get out if you don't have tweezers or fingernails long enough to pull out. Not happy paying $19.00.,2
1080,"The case works well and charges the phone quickly. However, it is bulky and a headphone adapter is needed to use the headphone jack. The case comes with the adapter but be prepared to carry it with you when you want to use headphones.",2
1081,"Please read all the reviews regarding installation difficulty. To start with, this is not a one person job. It requires a team of two, with two ladders to accomplish. And patience. I suggest partnering with someone other than your significant other, unless you desire a divorce. Upon receiving this item, promptly head to Lowes or a hardware store. You will need to purchase: 2 3"" #6 machine screws to replace the ones which are far too short. You will also need two good sized washers and two wing nuts. Don't be too concerned, your #6 wing nuts to fit the screws will look tiny. The photo is from another reviewer where I got the idea. The additional installation tip, is that once we had the mounting bracket in place, we tied a piece of chef's twine to each screw, with plenty of length. We ran the strings through the holes on the backing of the light fixture. We used these strings to help guide the light fixture onto the screws, and then secured with the washers and wing nuts after snipping off the string. SUCH a pain and hassle, but for $90, it looks good and works fine. Also, this one comes with a glass diffuser instead of plastic which I assume will hold up better over time and maybe look better too. I wouldn't say ""don't buy this"", but I would be forewarned. I hope this review is helpful! Good luck!",2
1082,"This item had an issue with the #1 key right out of the box. Unfortunately, I purchased it in August and I didn't get a chance to return it in time so I'm stuck with it now. I also purchased one of these in July of last year, and it completely died with no reason or warning. It wasn't dropped or abused in any way, just completely stopped working, even with new batteries. That's what led me to purchase this one, which adds a ""1"" to the numbers you're typing in if you hit any of the numbers close to the 1. It also seems to omit numbers that you feel like you've typed, so the keys on this one are very inconsistent and temperamental. Technically it works, but not great.",2
1083,It only took my 2 year old 3 days to figure out how to work this lock. I did a lot of research before buying this lock because I read it was really tough to figure out (from a toddler's perspective). Either she is too smart or the lock is not as child proof as it should be.,2

Tried blowing the lint out; tried straightening the tool so the stuck lint would flow out -- no luck.",2
1091,"I am very unhappy with the helmet I received, it came out of the box warped (the shape of the helmet was bent like it had been squished.) The antennae on the side of the helmet had snapped off and will need to be glued back on. There's a really garish emblem on the back of the helmet that's part of the helmet mold so it can't be painted over. I'd say the only saving grace about this helmet is that it's big enough to fit my fat head. Overall you'd be better off buying a helmet off of Etsy.",2

1094,"Broke in less than 2 months, and I‚Äôm only 110 lbs. Great product in the beginning, but the plastic is cheap and cracks if you put too much weight on it. It‚Äôs relatively easy to use compared to other boards. Stable center, low height, less wobbly in nature. I love the idea of it though. So much better than sitting all day and easier on the feet and back than just standing. Works your balance.",2

After significant phone time they ended up re-charging me for a new order with like a 3$ discount. I thought it was pretty unprofessional because not only did they lose it, but they led me to believe they'd rectify it only to charge me almost full price at the end of a 30 minute phone call with some spiel about a voucher.

I have tried it 3x for smoking meat and it has failed in this way about 10 times. each time the only way i can figure it out is to notice that the temp stays the same for a long time, like 20 minutes or so, and then I must power cycle the device and force close and reopen the app. After i do this it starts working again.

1188,"Disappointed. I am used to another brand with adhesive to make it stick. These were covered in a slimy liquid that does stay on. It worked ok, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs 2 stars, not 1.",2
1189,"To be honest I should have looked closer regarding this product. This item boy comes in one size....tiny. Now I am a tall person so I am larger than most people. The only way these would stop any noise is if I shoved them way deep into my ear canal which I would not do. As it was, they were hard to remove. I will now search for a similar item than comes in different sizes.....I‚Äôll keep these for my wife.",2
1190,Very low quality materials and construction.,2
1191,"These are incredibly thin, it practically rips when you have to open it and put something in it. All of them had a small tear on top and when we put a party favor in each, they would just rip more. If you need something sturdy, look for something else.",2
1192,"Don't buy this, cheaply made, already broken after six months.",2
1193,"I really wanted to like these. I got them specifically for driving as they have better allowance for peripheral vision. Problem is, like most low price point sunglasses they have a lens distortion. The distortion is subtle/minimal compared to other cheap models however it is most definitely still there and will wear on your eyes in the end. What a shame - otherwise the frame quality is quite good",2
1194,Does not match dark skin,2
1195,"I really wanted to like this, but i can‚Äôt get it to work with an OtterBox defender. When I place my phone on it, it charges for a few seconds but then it stops, waits a few seconds, tries again, and goes back off. The ledge it sits on is also a little small and doesn‚Äôt like to hold my phone on there. I haven‚Äôt had any luck horizontally either. The stand looks really nice on my nightstand though. The charger did work for me without a case, so I may buy a thinner case to be able to work with the charger.",2
1196,"I was very excited and optimistic about this product! When first trying it, it was very comfortable but I wished it could be a little taller. I used it for a couple months at work and the seat started the slowly lower while sitting. I contacted the manufacturer directly and the customer was great. They sent me a replacement part and I was satisfied. Until about 2 months later and it is having the same problem. Contacted them again, they sent another replacement part but this one for some reason or another won‚Äôt raise as high as the others had. When contacted again, the customer service rep let me know that it could take a month to get a new part shipped from overseas. I like this product but am disappointed with the quality.",2
1197,"The hot water bottle stays warm for a good amount of time, but it STINKS! I kept it outside for over a week to try and get rid of the smell and it‚Äôs just as bad as day 1. If I let my clothes touch it, they smell too. I will be looking for another product to replace this one. Irritated I didn‚Äôt return it in the right amount of time.",2
1198,"The product looks nice and will do what it's intended for, but it arrived with scratches in the acrylic which make me question how long before it looks like trash. Shelf inserts were a nice touch though.",2
1199,"the pen was heavy, it was just a simple rollerball cartridge in pretty casing which was alright, I suppose. What I wasn't happy about was that the pen came chipped and the chipped piece wasn't in the packaging so that I could glue it back on. It was wrapped better than most things I've ordered online so there's no way this was done through shipping and the thing was not delicate. maybe just not checked thoroughly before being wrapped up?",2
1200,Still hurts my feet.,2
1201,I‚Äôll pay extra money to come in early and they come in a month,2
1202,It‚Äôs cute but very poor quality. Gets rusted quick.,2
1203,"My friend recommended the mask of this line so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all in one milk. I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just not tolerable. You know that musty smell old buildings use in female restrooms to try to mask the smell of *ladies* but it just turns out as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell? Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this. You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries. I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough. I've lost a few favorite lines to them changing the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (which I called Davines and they said it isn't) but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.",2
1204,Good quality but too small,2
1205,This fit well so I can't complain about that. The white is just so see through. Will probably never wear it!,2
1206,Love love the case but it cracked at the top and bottom while putting it on the device. Sad,2
1207,This item was way too oversized. The floral print on sleeves is a different material than the black middle of the top. The flowers also look super fake.,2
1208,Shirt was cute but quality of material was not great,2
1209,"I was so disappointed in these shoes. They took so long to be delivered, without and shipping updates whatsoever. When I finally got them I discovered a cheaply made shoe. The platform is either styrofoam or a stacked cardboard like material, and the straps are a very thin and cheap looking felt. The buckle on the ankles do not even properly clasp. I‚Äôm giving this product two stars because in pictures and from a distance they do serve the look I am trying to achieve.",2
1210,"I thought the lotion would feel, a little more creamy. Feels very watery for lotion. Not satisfied, cant even tell of it moisturizes my body.",2
1211,My son loves Optimus Prime. He only has this for a couple of hours before he broke off several pieces trying to transform it.,2
1212,Half the papers had weird creases in the middle. Could only use about 300 pages out of 500.,2
1213,The battery that comes with the flashlight is no good dies really fast and the magnet is really weak,2
1214,LIttle uncomfortable and didn‚Äôt notice a difference and they had fallen out while I was sleeping,2
1215,"I liked this holder. It looked really nice on my keyring, however....it broke after three months. The ring snagged on something in my pocket and when I pulled on it, the piece of material that holds it onto the medallion snapped off. So, I am trying a different holder that is one piece of leather.",2
1216,"Lasted 14 Months then died. Used a couple of times a week over 14 month period, so maybe that's all that can be expected of it.",2
1217,just didn't care for it,2
1218,"Bought it for its features. While it worked, it was fine. Problems: was too inconsistent in detecting shots and tee boxes. So requires intervention almost every hole to ensure accuracy. Impossible to play well if one was to focus on the app. And after 11 months, almost 60% of the sensors are no longer working. Save your money and hassle.",2
1219,"This book is like a footnote guide to things you already know.... It rings of truth but barely glances over every subject with 6-8 page chapters in a larger print. I guess it is great for bathroom reading... Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but the depth of the subject matter left something lacking.",2
1220,Pockets and strap too tight. Difficult to get things in and out of while wearing.,2
1221,"The attachment cleaning tool doesn't fit on my Shark Navigator. The item seems to be made of sturdy plastic, but I'm unable to use it. This item needs more fittings to accommodate various vacuums. This isn't as ""Universal"" as we're led to believe. I'm disappointed. Returning for refund.",2
1222,Balls were smaller than I thought they were going to be.,2
1223,"Too Warm - Expected it to be made out of a material like a bath towel. Very soft, but seems like an old lady would wear this to stay warm inside a building that the A/C is on in the summertime on a 95 degree day...",2
1224,"Gosh! They sent me a different item. I saw the picture and it showed it‚Äôs medium roast coffee, so I bought two of them. But I got the light roast coffee. Can‚Äôt just trust the picture information.",2
1225,Directions for set up are not in english not well put together.,2
1226,These are a good value for your money they look nice but they are way too heavy I saw some review that said lightweight which made me purchase ....they are definitely not lightweight,2
1227,Pump settings do not work. Lowest two settings pump no water although you can hear and feel the pump working. 3rd setting pumps too much water so spills on the floor - I have varied the water depth but it made no difference. Looks great but going back as it does not work as expected.,2
1228,wish I've read the reviews first. What a disappointment.,2
1229,"Very large and the moter is loud, it‚Äôs not realistic at all. Disappointed",2
1230,This did not work very well on my 2 cairn terriers.,2
1231,It just doesnt look like picture. The picture looks tightly gathered and beautifully ruffled. I've had it awhile now and I'm going to take it off bed and try to do some sewing to it and see if I can fix it. I probably should have returned it right away but it's too late now and I think with some adjustments I can make it work.,2
1232,"Performs as expected for cooking purposes. However, handle melted when resting on rim of frying pan for a very short time. This an unacceptable and is a possible safety issue. Would not buy again.",2
1233,"The wicker is wrapped much more loosely than pictured. Basically an outline of the ball, not the multiple layers as shown. Will not buy again.",2
1234,"Bought this as a humidifier, the ""air cleaning"" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something. As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.",2
1235,Does not fit well on all large breed dogs. Cheaply made and broke very easily. The product didn‚Äôt hold up longer than 2 months for both a small boxer and a extra large king shepherd dog.,2
1236,"We use Wooster all the time in 9"" and 11"" rollers and love the coverage. Tried this one but the holder was not good.",2
1237,"Very flimsy, thin felt on top, thin rubber bottom.",2
1238,I like the product it‚Äôs a nice size and color! Unfortunately only had it a week and opened the one door and it cracked the top of the wood piece! I‚Äôm really disappointed! It‚Äôs all assembled and I don‚Äôt have the box anymore so how could I even think about sending it back?! My husband did try and fix it with wood glue but sadly that didn‚Äôt work either! The door popped right out again!!,2
1239,"A lot of the welds were very sketchy, which made assembly more difficult. I say more difficult because the instructions are unintelligible with pictures that serve almost no function. I still managed to put it together and it holds my guitars, but wobbles too much for my comfort when placing or removing a guitar. Not sure how long it'll last.",2
1240,Not delicious without altering. Very acidic straight or diluted. I would prefer something smoother and darker.,2
1241,"1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box. The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on. Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point. The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times... They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying. On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.",2
1242,Even with a pre-shave conditioner it burned the crap out of my throat.,2
1243,I gifted this phone to my cousin and she indicated to me that it is very hot. She has to use the speaker when making calls. A technician told her it may be the motherboard.,2
1244,still waiting for the first issue,2
1245,I returned. They were slightly too large and the color was off.,2
1246,I ordered the xl and it is way to small.,2
1247,The kit comes with the wrong tool to swap the lens. The T4 tool is too big to take off the screws to replace the lenses. Be careful not to strip the screws while attempting to swap lenses. Luckily my lenses were already a little loose so I was able to replace them. Other than that the lenses seem to be of decent quality. They seem just as dark as the original lenses.,2
1248,No support. Just seemed to keep the ladies pushed down and against me. Returning.,2
1249,"This is the 2nd time I have ordered these bottles. My first one came packaged in a sealed box, no damage whatsoever. This order came and although the outside Amazon box was in perfect condition, the box of rollerballs inside was smashed, torn up, and not sealed. The caps are all scratched up. I was making up some rollerballs for gifts for my family, and hate the thought of gifting these! Hoping this is a fluke, and they‚Äôll make it right quickly!",2
1250,Broke within a week and was told I could not use the extended warranty I bought until after the manufacturer warranty is expired. What a rip off.,2
1251,"I returned this bottle unused. Didn't like the baby pink color and the pink and blue print of the insulation sleeve. The description said rose quartz, but it is just baby pink. The product looked like cheap plastic and did not appeal to me visually.",2
1252,"Product did not last long at all, been using 4 to 5 days a week at the gym, they no longer work. Starting using in August, shopping for a new pair ,today.",2
1253,"Great concept, but the wires are still a mess and this did not do much to help the problem",2
1254,My hair is bleached and this definitely didn‚Äôt get the knots out after a shower.,2
1255,Did not crimp the tube tubes,2
1256,"It looks great, but after using it, it just doesn't do the job. I guess it's good for the price, but I definitely wish I would have spent a little more money and got a product that actually works.",2
1257,Images shows a double case pink one and green one. I only received the green. Not at all what i ecpected,2
1258,I like the quality but extremely too small. Looks like a 2x.,2
1259,Fits kind on tight in the chest area and I'm a 38B and purchase large,2
1260,"It moves too easily when you slide an envelope through it. It needs to have a non-skid bottom incorporated to its design. I only have one functioning arm, so I can't hold the opener to keep it from moving. This design flaw defeats the purpose of this purchase in my unique circumstances.",2
1261,"These are wonderful poles tall durable the cap is nice on the top, reflective tape is good. The only downside that is disappointing is I bought the yellow ones and within a month they are compleatly faded. I was using them in the summer to mark areas on a field. Now they are almost white which makes them very hard to see, kind of defeats the purpose of buying nice visible poles.",2
1262,Quality wise very cheap not durable.,2
1263,"I really like these glasses while they last, but an arm has broken on at least three of them and I'm not buying them again.",2
1264,"I received these for Father's day 2018. At first I really loved them, but the battery doesn't last long, therefore I could only use one at a time while the other stayed in the charger. After five months they stopped working. I could charge them all day and night and they would not come on. What a waste of money. I'm very disappointed and highly recommend you look into a different product. Unfortunately the time to return these have come and gone and now I'm stuck with a useless paperweight",2
1265,"This lamp looks and feels very cheap however for $10 it does the job. Item did not come with remote (box has picture of lamp with remote) and the motion sensor does not work. I chose this item because it said Amazons Choice, however it was not what I was expecting!",2
1266,"It's big, but the colors are awful. Throwing away not worth it to return",2
1267,Great style and pattern but Material is cheap and looks it.,2
1268,Very cheap material. Didnt seem to be safely connected to seat well enough,2
1269,The protective case seemed good quality. The tempered glass showed up in a separate package and the box was empty.,2
1270,Didn‚Äôt really see results with this...still have a lot left because I found other products that worked much better..I will say it lasts long...,2
1271,"First of all it doesn't dissolve in water. 2nd of all, it doesn't seem to make a difference in workout with or without.",2
1272,I bought these for birthday goodie bags. My girls are obsessed with squishes. These however are not actual squishies and I was not aware of that. Really disappointing.,2
1273,"Very thin material, the small fit very large, especially in chest. Not sure who this would fit it's just a strange design and material. For reference I am 5'8, 130lbs, 32DD. Provided no support as well and very flimsy",2
1274,I have used the full contents and have not seen any true changes in my feet. I am diabetic and do have diabetic problems that this product was not effective on.,2
1275,Not what I expected.,2
1276,The download for this software is available for free elsewhere,2
1277,"I got that as a Christmas present for a 4 year old. For adults it's ok to put together but for a 4 year old not, it is to difficult to clip them together. The led lights would work only for a couple of days and then only partially. Out of 5 cars only 2 work ok, the others are very slow even with new batteries. It hurts to watch them struggling around the tracks and praying they make the round while the 2 strong cars crash into the slow once and push them around. All in all good idea but didn't go through quality control for sure. Big disappointment!",2
1278,I ordered about 8 items and got only five of them delivered. The other three package was nowhere to be found even though it is shown that it was delivered. I tried to find the items everywhere but there was nothing.,2
1279,This arrived on time. The thread came apart pretty quickly. The colors were very nice. My son loved this toy. He was quite disappointed that the threading came undone.,2
1280,Not very good they sheets easily rip as you try to bloat and wipe the extra oil on your face. Going back to Clean & Clear oil absorbing sheet are the best kind. Sad I wasted my money on trying these they totally disappointed me.,2
1281,"Would not recommend. The bits are poorly made. It isn't a big deal on the philips and other bits that don't need percision, but the holes and lobes of some of the security bits are off enough where I don't think I could use them.",2
1282,This slime is not fluffy it was very sticky. The picture shows the slime swirled together and you cannot do that with this slime.,2
1283,"This did not help my hair and scalp. Had a pretty bad allergic reaction,I am not saying it is bad product. Just didn't work for me.",2
1284,Smells a little oily...,2
1285,I miss their old design. Too hard to get my little one into this. Notice that the shoulder strap attaches to the door. I need to have the bag on my shoulder to get my dog in properly. So disappointed. Found older version on EBay and bought 3 of them!,2
1286,"These mats are functional, but they are NOT the same color as seen in the pics. Not even close. The mats I received were a very light grey, and not the dark grey depicted on this page. I sent them back. .",2
1287,"I have two cats. One has a very healthy appetite and carries a good weight. The other is finicky and though she eats a lot of what she likes, she stays quite thin. I had hoped to add a bit of weight on her, but she wouldn't touch this supplement (she does wolf down her Organic Hairball Remedy which comes in similar form). My other guy sniffed, but after one tentative tiny lick, walked away (and he eats almost anything). Doesn't smell particularly appetizing (i.e., doesn't smell like food) to me either. Waste of money for this household.",2
1288,"Great product for a while, the hard plastic is a perfect fit! The problem is the rubber will start to fail in a year or two and the case will no longer be good. Shop around before you buy:)",2
1289,"Completely thought this was a wall decal that‚Äôs sticks right away. You have to remove the butterflies from the card and still put the adhesive sticker on it. Some stickers are a bit big for the butterfly. It still looks nice, but requires a bit more effort than other wall decals",2
1290,"It was a nice cover at first, and does seem like it will offer necessary protection in case of a drop, but after about a week it started discoloring. I ended up returning it.",2
1291,Bought a few for craft show tables. I‚Äôve owned them for years & I just can‚Äôt get the wrinkles out.,2
1292,Not to well when u have to erase it,2
1293,"It looks like these are Xerox copies of what they should be. The resolution on the lines is choppy. Also many of the designs only cover a fraction of the page, less than half. My daughter will still get some use out of it and it wasn't too expensive, but it isn't anywhere near as nice as other adult coloring books she has had.",2
1294,Purchased 2 of these for me and my son. It is way too tight to fit credit cards into the slots that they are supposed to fit in.,2
1295,Applied per directions and it still does not lay properly. I going to find the one I had before.,2
1296,This product is very hard to use.,2

1298,"Bottoms are great, but absolutely no top support",2
1299,"First of all, this had no directions or even a product photo in the package. I had to open my order on Amazon to literally figure out which sides attach. The other problem? Unless you look live in a Hobbit house or are really tall, don‚Äôt bother. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and I can‚Äôt even reach the hooks without going on my toes or getting a ladder. The wood was really splintery and the front pieces of metal were pretty rough looking.",2
1300,"Love the quilted material. The rod inserts are a good idea, the slipcover arms and rods pull out even with the slightest recline. The advertisement says "" straps"", but there is only one strap for the chair back in the package. Will fold the arms underneath the seat portion to try and get some use from the product. Very disappointed.",2
1301,"I sent this back. It had my body fat extremely low, and while I‚Äôd love to believe that what it says is true, I know it‚Äôs not accurate. And what‚Äôs the point of having a scale of it isn‚Äôt accurate??",2
1302,Tiny for the price. I thought it was going to be a product for my whole body. But I‚Äôd use the whole bottle with one application.,2
1303,"I tried for a month to break this in... but it just isn't the same ball as the ones that others bring to your gym. It doesn't have the same grip or general feel, and looses air very quickly. Better than your average ball still, but not what I paid for and not worth $50+",2
1304,I really wanted to like this but first when the package came the soap was so strong you can smell it from the sealed package but after you shave the smell that it leaves behind is amazing. Still trying to create a lather was ridiculously hard.,2
1305,"The Puzzle dictionary is too heavy to handle. The words, Clues, I tried to look up were more difficult than the clue itself. Would not suggest it for making Crossword Puzzles easier.",2

1309,I did not get my product yet. It was listed as a prime item with the standard 2 day lead time. It is scheduled to come tomorrow. That means it took a week to get. Not sure of the issue but that is the story. Hopefully it get's here tomorrow Thanks,2
1310,They are very uncomfortable. I can't sleep on them!!,2

1313,"This is a nice looking band with some serious problems. First, the clasp is nearly impossible to open, especially one-handed. Second, if you make it small enough to fit your wrist (in order to get the HR monitor to register), then it is even more difficult to get back on if you are able to get it open and off.",2
1314,"Never actually got to try the product. It came in the packaging, with some sort of tape over the bottle and loose powder all inside the package. There was also no inner protective seal. Quite frankly it looks like it was a used product that was shipped to me. Returning for a refund.",2
1315,you cant see your shot very good at all!!,2
1316,"This was my first menstrual cup and unfortunately it just didn't work for me. Even after getting the hang of putting it in and taking it out, the silicone is just way to firm for me. I bought the small size but maybe the diameter was still to wide? It was too painful to wear.",2
1317,I would have liked them to be smaller!,2
1318,Falls out of the socket a lot. Not very sturdy either,2
1319,"Well, I‚Äôve ordered a ton of plants from Amazon, and this one came in the worst shape. They should have sent me a different one.

They are held on by friction only and I guess the vibration was all it took to drop them off although I had no excessive vibration warning. I pushed them onto the existing Mavic legs as far as they would go and they seemed secure but when the drone returned after a 20 minute flight, they were gone. The back legs snap on and were still there. The gimbal guard , stick protector and lens hood are fine but the leg extensions were my reason for the purchase. I gave an extra star for the other parts that seem ok.",2

1329,They were beautiful but way to fragile. One cracked while putting gumballs inside and the second while washing at the end of the party. I am left with only one. Very disappointed.,2

1334,"Was way more orange looking then the pictures, it is a very bright light orange color.",2
1335,"Though these technically serve their purpose, and are easy enough to handle, I personally wish these were not as transparent. Because they are so transparent, they actually are much lighter {individually} than the picture. You can see the covered Bingo card numbers right through these chips.

1338,"These worked reasonably well for a while... I actually used them non-stop (except to charge) for 5 days after I got them. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and I was impressed at the battery life. They easily lasted 8+ hours, and charged quickly. After the initial 5 day spurt of use I would only use them intermittently afterwards, and they continued to work fine and held a charge when not in use well as long as they were powered off obviously. The downsides to these... the volume was not all that loud. Sometimes I was using them in louder environments (at a race track, on a plane) and I pretty much had to have my computer or phone at max volume to hear them easily. I was not listening to music most of the time, typically talk radio or shows so this could have contributed to why I had to have the volume maxed the entire time. Along those same lines, the noise isolation is nonexistent. So that really doesn't help matters when the volume does not go that loud. The real problem came when after 4 months of ownership they just stopped working. They will no longer connect to any device for longer than a second or two before they immediately disconnect. I've contacted Optoma for a warranty replacement so we will see how that goes. So far it has been 3 days and I still have not received my RMA slip. GIven the relatively low amount of use these saw I am very disappointed that they failed so early. But the accessories they come with are excellent, I really liked the pouch as I could keep it clipped to the exterior of my travel bag so the headphones were always in easy reach when I needed them. The pouch could use a little mesh pocket inside to keep the charging cable contained, but that is another minor gripe about the whole setup in general.",2

1346,This product is definitely lightweight but it‚Äôs so cheap feeling due too how thin it is. I have purchased many swaddles and was so excited to finally try this brand because how popular they are and since they have really cute prints BUT the seems look like after two more washes they will come undone and it‚Äôs so thin and large I don‚Äôt know what real use I‚Äôll get out of it. Not practical for the baby to lay and play on it due to how this and not practical for a good swaddle in my opinion especially if your a first time mom and new to swaddling,2

1354,"My lamps arrived yesterday and I opened and set them up today. I ordered five of these lamps and have already noticed issues with a few of them. One has an arm that is so loose I can only use it clamped to a horizontal surface. If I clamp it to a vertical surface, the arm continues to droop far past where I want it to be. I tried to tighten the nut where it is attached to the clamp, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. Another has an arm that droops towards the lamp end, but the fitting is tight, so it appears the flexible arm itself is just a bit weak. Lastly, a third lamp has flickered as I adjusted the direction of the bulb, the bulb is screwed all the way in too, so it is not loose in the socket. So far, I‚Äôm not impressed with these lamps but hope they serve my plants well and ultimately the lamps have a long life. I‚Äôll update my review in a month or so, once I‚Äôve had time to evaluate if they‚Äôre truly beneficial for my plants.",2

1392,"I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic. It's not the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me as much as the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap. For me, this detail ruined the whole look for me. I also did not trust it to hold up to everyday wear so I ended up returning it. I was disappointed because it seemed like it would have been a good deal if it had not been for that.

The Philips head screwdriver could barely turn the the screw that holds the case tightly together because one of the legs of the ""+"" is missing.

1403,The smell was repellant with a chemical smell. It only smelled faintly like ylang ylang.,2
1404,it was just ok. I work in a warehouse and I have a walkie-talkie attached to my shoulder so its nice to have music to listen to in my other ear but its not loud enough. I didn't really have high expectations for the sound quality but it wasn't even loud enough to hear the lyrics. Mine must have been defective because I've it in 3 occasions and it would die after 31/2 hours of constantly playing music.,2
1405,They break or stop working and I was thinking it was my phone but it was the cord not a good buy for long term use.

Problem I have with both mounts is the phone starts to droop down as I'm driving from the weight of the phone.

We did purchase a 2nd mat and I PRE-sewed those before use. The only other issue is with large dog TOENAILS puncturing the plastic weave.

So clearly this thing was packaged as new but it was not. I will see if it works it seems to be working but I am quite concerned that I received a router with pre-existing information programmed inside of it.",2
1489,Not even close to the good ol' cartoon. Had to stop after 15 minutes.,2
1490,It was not what I expected at all from the description on web site.,2
1491,Poor quality. Very disappointed. I usually love the Zebra pens. The pen inside the case already had chipped marks on the design.,2
1492,"My goodness, my poor armpit, pinched my skin so bad . I really don‚Äôt like this electric razor , I go over one area for so many times just for one piece of hair .",2
1493,"Fit as expected, however there was a defect on the sleeve that i didn‚Äôt notice until after I washed it.",2
1494,comfy at first but wears down fairly quickly. stretched out and slips off feet when walking,2
1495,"I like the look of this band, really dresses up my fitbit. the clasp, however, is ridiculously hard to open and close. I was able to remove a link with the tool provided but there are no instructions provided at all. Would not buy again.",2
1496,"Unfortunately, these strainers developed rust spots after their first use.",2
1497,"If you are looking for a ton of stickers to use as rewards and care more about quantity than quality, these would work for you. These stickers are good for the price, but that's about it. The designs are not very well drawn, and the stickers fall off of the plastic very easily. When they are put onto something else (like a plastic name tag lanyard), they are difficult to remove, resulting in the sticky half staying stuck and the front half ripping off.",2
1498,Easy to install but there‚Äôs still bubbling all around the edges. The edges are raised off of the watch face so you can tell there‚Äôs a protector on it and hair and lint will more than likely get caught on it.,2
1499,"I have bought two of these already, the cap keeps breaking. If you don't tighten it down enough it leaks, but you can easily over tighten it and break the cap. I was very careful this time and it still happened. Would like to just but more caps but cant find them separate. Be careful with the cap.",2
1500,"Very cute but Way to small! They are 6.5"" in width (open) 6.5"" L but the holder plastic part is 3"" and very flimsy! and Not eligible for refund!",2
1501,"This is not good quality, and will not hold much weight, card board bottoms bend. A little stronger built would improve this product.",2
1502,I wanted to take these for at least a month before writing the review. They did help with some of the symptoms of PCOS BUT I wanted it to help me ovulate and instead I've been spotting for 3 days 2 weeks after taking them. My periods are normally regular so I've never done this before. My period wasn't due for another week when I started spotting. Disappointed):,2
1503,The main issue with this ped is it shuts off all the time. I dropped it once and it to me a couple days to get it to work again. I would not buy another.,2
1504,For the price of these leggings I would say they are not good quality. They are very see through. Even if you take your hand and stretch the fabric you can see directly through it. These leggings are extremely long. I am 5'6 and normally need a long inseam and these are much too long for me. They bag and roll behind the knee with the extra material and don't lay right since they are too long. I would also suggest to size down since they run big in my opinion.,2
1505,Stopped working after one day of use Music and sound continued but blew 1-3 bubbles after using for an hour(vs multiple ),2
1506,"I really wanted to like these. So cute hanging on a hook on my fridge! Unfortunately that's all they are good for. There's no thumbs and they don't bend, so it's really impractical to pick anything up.",2
1507,"In theory these should work well, however, I could not get these to stay in place once they‚Äôve been used a couple of times. Once they start falling off, they are useless and makes breastfeeding frustrating.",2
1508,"I love these shelves but I was pissed when I went to put them up. The metal washer covers don't fit over all the plastic washer. So, I was stuck leaving the ugly black plastic washers showing. Very upsetting. You can't tell this at first glance either unless you physically put the washers inside of a metal piece.",2
1509,These liners were very short and does not provide needed coverage.,2
1510,I was so excited to receive and use this...they arrived broken. A replacement is being sent but highly suggest better packaging to avoid broken products.,2
1511,"Each of these operates on 3 triple A batteries which they burn through rapidly. Plus, they are not nearly as bright as suggested. Find another source. I query the rave reviews.",2
1512,Sent it back because it‚Äôs much bigger than a normal wallet,2
1513,"This was too much detail on things I already understand, so for me, it wasn‚Äôt a good selection. That being said, if you are just starting out on making lifestyle changes for managing auto immune issues this is a great book for you.",2
1514,"Not going to last long, used it one day and corners are already chipping",2
1515,Didn‚Äôt remove hair very well,2
1516,Very tight fit in the fingers. Hand fit is good. Never have had to wear a workout glove larger than a large.,2
1517,"Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed. However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car. The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob. This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it. There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle.",2
1518,Its splitting apart.,2
1519,Does the job but not stylish,2
1520,Not so good and my dog destroy it within three days... Maybe my dog is too strong.,2
1521,"I've been using these gripper gloves for years now, but this year the ones that arrived have some very odd shapes for the phalanges. The thumb gripper section now curls inward so that part of the thumb joint isn't protected in the inside but the outside of the knuckle is covered and irritated by the rubber. The same goes with the fingers and the Large gloves aren't very large any more and I had to struggle to get my not-so-fleshy fingers into the gloves. It would be nice if the sizes were just a bit smaller, but with the odd shapes I don't know if I'll be repeating an online order for these next time and instead find them in a local store so I can try them on first.",2
1522,"I did not notice any difference. I wanted it to work, but even with the Placebo effect I did not feel anything.",2
1523,"I was initially very happy with the 2 bowls I received. I use them as water bowls for my dogs. However after about 4 months, the inside of the bowls are covered with rust spots.",2
1524,The taste was wasn't very good,2
1525,"Quality of cover was not as expected, showed wear lines after one week of use",2
1526,"It does the job. The is always a little feedback. Unfortunately, when you plug in the phone to charge, the feedback gets kicked up to an uncomfortable level.",2
1527,"The proportions of the pants did not fit my body. The pants were snug in the legs (as desired), but it was way too big in the waist. I am 5'3, 120 lbs and I ordered an xs. I fear the xxs would be too tight in the legs. I am returning this item.",2
1528,Gave me horrible gas. Did not like taste.,2
1529,"Good concept as personally I need one lease Forbes bicycling one for driving one for other. Problem 1/3 lens doesn‚Äôt work it won‚Äôt snap in. Going to keep it, but this is a vendor quality control issue they need to address. In my case black lense is cut to short, so won‚Äôt snap in. The frame fit on my head is very comfortable so is the nose piece.",2
1530,"I am giving this 2 stars because I don't like how close his goatee is to his nose, it looks like a mustache or even like a mouth. The paint for it should have been lower.",2
1531,"I wanted to love this suit!! The pattern is adorable! I ordered an XL (I‚Äôm usually a 10-12, between medium and large in pants and tops) so I thought it would be plenty big enough. It barely covered my behind and left me with lots of side boob. After 2 pregnancies my boobs are not what they used to be, but based on where these cups fall you would think they were sagging to my belly button!! The straps in the back cut into me and made it hurt to wear, and if I were to cut them to make it a halter my boobs would be out and about. It just fell so awkwardly on me! The suit I got was the same as the first picture in description. Cute print and nice fabric, but def not for me",2
1532,"Gave as Christmas gift, stopped working 3 mos. later. Very disappointed because it was a nice product and gave off a good amount of humidity to the air unlike some. I also thought it had a nice style. My return windo is closed unfortunately.",2
1533,Napkins are really pretty but very hard. They are like sandpaper!,2
1534,"I weigh 165lbs and typically wear a medium size in top and large at the bottom. The top is way too big and the padding is very odd. It looks unflattering. It would look better on someone who has a bigger chest. However, I did like the bottoms, but they are pretty revealing. Also the color in the picture is way off from the color i actually received. Overall I'm disappointed with this purchase.",2
1535,Does not accommodate phone calls from iPhone. Listening to music while charging works however does not allow for phone calls on iPhone,2
1536,"Nice brushes and low price cost of 2 pack. My son loves the colours of the brushes, but feel small in his hand. Also ,very small brush tooo. I would like to say not cleaned well, just ok.",2
1537,Look else ware. Not really a great quality product.,2
1538,Very sticky...leaves a white residue on furniture,2
1539,"Juvenile and boring. The mechanics were reasonably well done,with the exception of sentence structure, missing words. A selected read and a volunteered review.",2
1540,Looks good fits a kid too small,2
1541,"Even after 12 hours, there were still some bubbles watched the video amd followed the steps. Customer service is solid as well.",2
1542,"They are not that bright, easy to install.",2
1543,ONE OF THE GRABBERS WILL NOT LOCK EXTENDED. CUPS ON BOTH ARE NOT REPLACEABLE. BOTH VERY WOBBLEY WHEN EXTENDED. CHEAPLY MADE! NOT A GOOD BUY!,2
1544,Some of the lids were bent and the glass had air bubbles in places. I needed them and had to keep but the quality could have been better,2
1545,Gets caught in loops where velcro meets,2
1546,The cleaning brush was not included. Straws are what I thought though.,2
1547,Bought 42mm for my series 3 .It looks good and exactly in the given picture however the strap loosens up very often .Not comfortable after you wear it for more than 15 minutes.The only good thing is that it comes from the protector which is quite useful to avoid any scratches .Overall disappointed with this strap.Have taken it off and gone back to the original sports strap from Apple.,2
1548,Sturdiness or lack of,2
1549,"Looks like circus tent material, but it fits well on the bed and looks a bit better than nothing if you want to hide stuff you keep under your bed.",2
1550,This did not have an adaptor to fix the tubing needed for my small outdoor fountain. Also the plug is not intended to be used outdoors as it is not waterproof or grounded (three prong). And very short cord.,2
1551,Not as described and it‚Äôs missing element to the female elf ... bottom trim looks bad ... I had it delivered to someone to customize it and I‚Äôm really upset that it wasn‚Äôt put together better !,2
1552,Had I know that this item was this small I would never have paid more than $5.00 for this product. I could‚Äôve gotten these at Target for half the price I paid. What a waste!,2
1553,"Applied these rubbed then as much as possible , daughter woke up and most were on the floor . The color is wasn‚Äôt quite Rose gold . Bummer what a waste and can‚Äôt return",2
1554,"I was bummed the edges of the card holders were smushed, I'm not able to straighten them, hopefully the recipients don't notice.",2
1555,Read closely....it's an expansion set...not the game,2
1556,Not very flexible so you will need extension arms to properly direct your GoPro.,2
1557,Nice quality but THE STAKES ARE TOO LONG!!! There is no way for me to get in in the ground far enough without the sign sticking up too far off the ground. It looks ridiculous. I'm going to have to take it somewhere to have the stakes shortened. I love the look of the sign but it is not worth the frustration so far.,2
1558,You get what you pay for. Clasp always comes undone and change spills out.,2
1559,"Did not work for me. Too big in the midsection, and too short. Not a flattering look at all.",2
1560,Using this case has caused very poor sound quality through my daughters phone. Voice is muffled to the point you can‚Äôt understand anything she is saying.,2
1561,Product was perfect shipping was incredibly slow...,2
1562,I returned it because it did not work!,2
1563,"I wish this had worked because I really like the scent, but it gave me a horrible rash.",2
1564,"First of all I'd like to know who got the devilish idea to add pockets to all dresses sold on Amazon. This is a really nightmare! The dress fit, and it's beautiful but because I do have large hips as an hourglass shape, the pockets make me look even larger. This is so disheartening. I hope I'll find a nice dress for my next trip to Jamaica!",2
1565,"Broke on first use, the cast aluminum is not strong with medium torque from screw clamps. But it's really cheap, maybe if your building bird houses it would be a good buy.",2
1566,I ordered the yellow colored one. It is way too bright. Feels slippery on feet especially according to the kids when they walk/run.,2
1567,"I love how it plays sound on my stream while connected to my el gato as well talk to my pals, but it only lasted for a week until the cords stopped working. If it would‚Äôve lasted longer I would give more ratings.",2
1568,I picked this book because the story had potential. Prologue was well written and gives you that thrill of anticipation for the next page. Then the first chapter happened...the POV writing was choppy and full cliches. I really tried to finish this book but more of the same on the next chapters and I lost interest.,2
1569,"I tried and tried, but the top and bottom corners of these panels curled and fell out repeatedly. I washed the windows first. I cut and then let the panels warm up, I wetted with soapy water. I used a squeegee. I even tried to hold the tops in place with double sided tape, and the bottoms curled up too. I'm very disappointed and have to come up with another idea. And FYI, if you are close to the panels, you can see what's on the side.",2
1570,Ordered the new style strap locks but received the old style! The old style is still a great product but I didn't order it!,2
1571,Did not see a difference in my pores after religiously using it every night for a month.,2
1572,"The taste is horrible. It is so artificial tasting that I have to chug it down. It does seem to do good, I am less sore after working out taking this. If they could make the taste less artificial it would be a great product.",2
1573,"The cuffs are exactly as the picture shows. However, I lost one with in the first hour of wearing them because you can not adjust the size.",2
1574,Wore these for the first time today. Had to come home and soak my feet in Epsom salt water. Were ok for about an hour. Did not provide much cushion. I'm a high school administrator and walk a lot on tile floors. I really needed these to work.,2
1575,"Bought because of the good review A diamond already fell out after wearing it for 4 days. I guess that‚Äôs what I get for the price. The color and style is beautiful, but that‚Äôs about it!",2
1576,"Does not stay on wall, falls off after I put a couple half-empty spice jars on each stripe.",2
1577,Right out of the plastic several of these were dirty. Won‚Äôt be reordering.,2
1578,"Comfortable, but NOT worth the $!",2
1579,Is this really white air dry clay? Maybe it's going to dry white? Much darker color than expected.,2
1580,I wanted to give these five stars but the dark green has already died after coloring one small area. The rest are going strong after much more coloring but I'm bummed not to have a full set right after the first use.,2
1581,did not fit standard bar size. they resent free and still did not fit.,2
1582,This may is no good to me because it won't work on tubes that have any type of texture on the tub. It would be nice if you have that in your description. The tub has to be totally smooth to use.,2
1583,"Used the X-Heavy about once or twice a week for a month or so. Would put it around ankles and walk with it up and down room 4 times. It snapped the other day. They were ok, wish they were more durable and stronger, felt as though the X-Heavy wasn't as heavy as should have been. The other bands are way too light.",2
1584,worked wonderfully for two months then stopped working.,2
1585,I noticed a couple of keys functions are backwards. I have to press a different key every time to place in my password. Not very happy about it.,2
1586,Wear a mask and open the windows! The smell is externally strong! I followed the instructions and this did not come out smooth. It‚Äôs very rough. I thought well maybe that‚Äôs just how it goes on so I continue with my 2 additional coats for 3 coats total but now it‚Äôs been 24 hours and it‚Äôs rough everywhere. I‚Äôm at a loss on what to do. I bought 2 cans as I wanted to do my shower floor but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm going to do it. I think I might buy the actual paint for that. Only giving this 2 stars bc of the convenience of having a spray instead of paint.,2
1587,No weight baring at all!!,2
1588,One came already broken üò¢,2
1589,One wire broke after a few uses. Not recommended.,2
1590,"At first I thought this product would be beneficial. I used it a number of times and it did seem to offer some comfort. Eventually I tried the heat and discovered that there was no heat. That was a deal breaker since that was a big reason for purchasing this product. Also, I started hearing noises coming from the product (popping) that were not there initially. No heat, can't keep. So I am returning this immediately. This has probably soured me on these type of massagers since all of them seem to be made in China and the quality is dubious. I had hoped to find something that would relieve my neck arthritis pain but obviously I must keep looking.",2
1591,You need a red bulb in order for them to flash but only one of the 3 sets I bought has them.,2
1592,Cable connection fits well. The cable does not always charge. Not a fan of these cables.,2
1593,"I ordered the Pro-Team Vacuum Cleaner and the suggested bags the the advertisement. The bags are the wrong size. Can I return them or am I stuck with what I ordered. Thank you, Curtis White",2
1594,"After 5 or 6 washings, these socks lost their elasticity at the top, causing the sock to fall inside my shoes beneath my heel. Find a better quality product.",2
1595,"I really loved this backpack; however, after only 3 uses the bag started to leak where the ""straw"" connects to the bladder. No matter how I clicked it in it would still leak and not a slow leak either.",2
1596,"Having been a fan since the beginning of this series,always looking forward to next book, was very disappointed with this book. Great lead ins,not enough follow thru. Seems more of someone else writing as the author I have followed for so many years. Far too much material devoted to language,etc. at end of the book. Would have appreciated as much attention in the story as had been displayed years prior . Where the author had .great story lines and interactions, they have become shortened and far more time added to sexual interactions. Far more erotica than story,which is of course the easier route. No more awaiting so anxiously for next installment as I would rather re-read her her earlier works which had substance.",2
1597,"Not flattering at all. Loved the print and the material was nice and thick. Good quality but the cut of the dress is not good. It doesn't hang all cute like the pic, but more like a think, stiffer flannel.",2
1598,One of the bracelets was broken and I was one bracelet short of how many I was supposed to get. A little disappointed.,2
1599,very lightweight and easy to spill litter when cleaning. you have to keep a good grip on it.,2
1600,"Doesn‚Äôt fit my surface go and doesn‚Äôt leave the upper camera spot open, completely blocked the view.",2
1601,"OK, you would think I would return it - however, the issue was that the gem in the middle was not attached, had come loose. Whatever they stuck it now with didn't hold. Crazy glue holds it just fine. so - for a cheap item, it's just fine.",2
1602,"I am not a fan of how works with my OtterBox, one side of the protective screen is up and I can't get it to sit flat with my case. It was definitely easy to install, but I don't think it's very adhesive.",2
1603,Sellers did not specify that the keyboard and pen were NOT included even though they have it pictured,2
1604,"Pieces fit together loosely; top you can almost just slide on versus screw on. The bottom piece does fit a little better than the top. Not a big fan of the little door on the side; has a tendency to drop the contents; although, it doesnt have any issues staying shut unless opened at the moment. Overall, not too bad and the ""pollen"" catcher works very well. Update Had for little over a month. Magnet that holds the door has now come out and won't keep shut. Not very well made",2
1605,"The desciption needs to be changed to PU leather, NOT LEATHER! this is wrong!!!!",2
1606,"very stiff, still can't shape it well",2
1607,Nice mirror works well on ezgo mounting brackets will need to be trimmed otherwise they will look ridiculous. I was also only given one thumb screw/knob which sucks but it's not worth the trouble to ship it back over that.,2
1608,I thought the key portion was detachable like the one I bought a few years ago. I had to buy one that didn't have the key.,2
1609,We live in a valley and the 15 mile an hour wind gusts completely destroyed it within a week of putting it up.,2
1610,"Good for washing windows or power-spraying your house, but I wouldn't use that sprayer on a garden.",2
1611,These sheets are soft as silk but they snag badly!üòû,2
1612,May be good solution for some not knocking the product itself. But for me they didn‚Äôt work. Not realistic at all but like I said others may love!,2
1613,"I didn't know that Tony Hillerman's daughter had taken up the reins to continue his Leaphorn/Chee legacy - I used to love those books. ""Cave of Bones"" was pretty good and brought back fond memories of the books, the characters, and the Southwest country... I enjoyed that one, so I tried this one (the author's first effort). But it's pretty weak. Shallow characterization; repetitive; some too-obvious clues/details. Oh well. Somewhere between this book and ""Cave of Bones"" her style and plotting must have improved, so maybe I'll try a few others.",2
1614,I purchased the item about 2 months ago. The fist few weeks the items was great then the watch started to freeze. I would have a blank screen at times the watch does the basic. There are some glitches,2
1615,"I recommend this product to everyone - so many compliments and when I tell them the price, it's unreal. Second pair that's broken....know get what you pay for, but disappointed.",2
1616,Sturdy but it doesn't transfer heat as well as other water bottles U have used. The large opening is nice and it seems to be holding up well.,2
1617,They are soft sheets. I only bought them for the cooling feature. They do NOT cool at all!!!! Do not buy for this feature.,2
1618,"I love this brand, but this is by far the worst scent they have. It does not smell anything like Jasmine. I highly recommend the orange blossom scent. Give this one a by.",2
1619,Plastic had white streaks.. Glue on application strips was old and not sticky..,2
1620,"Just not the quality I am used to from Brooks. I have worn Brooks for 25 years due to heavier support, these don't measure up.",2
1621,The concept of this would be great but the silicone band (for preventing slipping) is not stretchy enough and makes it impossible to get over my hips. And my hips are not that large... I'm not convinced it would be all that comfortable for a petite person either since the fabric is more stretchy than the silicone. I ended up sending this one back.,2
1622,Mine already broke. Within 2 weeks. Not worth. Better off duct taping my old charger.,2
1623,"I really like this bag. It was a gift, and I did not have a chance to use it for several months after I received it . The zipper broke on the first use. It has been too long to return it at this point.",2
1624,One of the things I like about the pixelbook is the keyboard responsiveness and how fast and easy it is to type. This cover is too restrictive and not as responsive as others I've used. It drastically slows typing speed. I have to press harder and backspace to fix corrections too often to make this cover worth it.,2
1625,"The fit was perfect and I love the light blue color. However, after I wore it one time and hand washed and air dryed the suit, part of the material changed color. It has gray areas all over it. I'm very disappointed. I don't understand why better material wasn't used because it felt great on!",2
1626,"They are cute but too light and made of thin metal. The handle is a bit short. It would be good if they made the utensil handle a bit longer and heavier. Except for the giraffe design, nothing special about the spoon and fork. One fork I received damaged.",2
1627,Ordered four and one of the four will not work! I am disappointed!,2
1628,Does not really do much of a difference. My wife stopped using it and was disappointed.,2
1629,It lasted a month and it started to tear on the side and then tore up.,2
1630,"Although it appears to be a genuine Sony battery, it held less charge when I got it in 2017 than the battery that came with the camera that was a couple of years older. Now, after 1 year it will no longer take a charge. Probably a quality control issue as others have said. I've just purchased another from Amazon, as Sony lists Amazon as an official retailer. I'm hoping it will do better. 2019 update. I'll stick with my 2 star rating. The battery I got appears to be a genuine Sony and has the hologram. However, it doesn't hold a charge as well as the one that came with the camera back in 2014. The 2014 battery weighs 2 oz and the 2017 battery weighs 1.5 oz, which goes a long way to explaining the poorer performance.",2
1631,"I LOVE THE SIZE BUT DOESNT PULL SMOKE & ODERS OUT. THE ODERS INSTEAD OF SUCKING IN, THEY SEEM TO BLOW OUT.",2
1632,The butterfly was flat and bigger than the picture,2
1633,"Well made, good price.after washing, dye ran lines diwn front of jeans",2
1634,"Bought this after I gave birth to lighten the line of my tummy. Didn't do anything but exfoliate the skin... although, the line did gas over time without the cream",2
1635,"The fit doesn‚Äôt quite work well with Phillips light strips, and the tabs tend to bend sideways when clamping the closure shut, which shorts out the color circuits and prevents you from being able to change colors to anything from white. The tabs have plastic retaining bits which prevent you from sliding the strip in because of the solder, so you have to bend the strip to get them to fit or try to clip out the plastic. I had better results just soldering the connectors to the strip itself. Definitely not worth the asking price.",2
1636,I just unboxed this freezer and its dented in multiple locations. Not what I expected from Amazon. I should have read all of the negative reviews because this apparently an issue with this brand. I plugged it in and it appears to be working. Bought a matching mini fridge at the same time and it is in a similar condition.,2
1637,"Physically well constructed, but the sound is muffled and bad. Also the battery life seems sub-par.",2
1638,"The groovy papaya colorway has a scripted champion logo stitched on on the picture on Amazon, but what came was a hoodie with just the ""c"" logo on the top right of the chest",2
1639,The magnetic backing came unglued from the base first use,2
1640,Gets linty quick it's more of q cotton martial,2
1641,First of all it took forever to get going. The thriller part doesn't even begin until halfway through the book. It gets interesting for awhile and then boom...it just over. Really unsatisfying ending. If this was a movie I'd say wait until it shows up on cable. I gave it two stars because it had potential otherwise I would have given one star.,2
1642,"Initially I fell in love with this protector, that was until my phone fell and my glass cracked WITH THE PROTECTOR ON",2
1643,"I've been using this product with success for over a year. They've just repackaged it along with an apparent change in flavor. While the texture is finer than before, I find the new resulting flavor distasteful and probably will stop using the product.",2
1644,"some of the packets were empty, peppermint and thyme. The seed for paragon and rosemary did not grow. I contacted the seller and was told sometime the packet are empty in error, was told they would send me those seeds, never did. Then the rosemary and tarragon did not grow. disappointing",2
1645,"Purchased 4 for our family. We used 2 yesterday. The plastic is not durable. Within an hour, one of the cases got a small hole in the plastic and the other had some condensation inside. Luckily, we noticed before too much water got in and caused damage. We tested the products as suggested last week and didn't notice any problema",2
1646,I liked how thick the product was also very sticky but it was very difficult to install and had a lot of air bubbles underneath that I was unable to remove,2
1647,"The product started working well, good sound quality and battery life. After 4 uses, the on off switch started to fail and now does not work at all.",2
1648,Doesn't do a good job measuring smaller increments.,2
1649,Cool product but did not last long. I wish I can contact a buyer to see if they can send me a new one.,2
1650,Didn't know that this type of hammer is not good neuro exams...,2
1651,It is the perfect color green and it arrived on schedule. The stickers are not sticky enough and do not stay where they were put. The keep peeling up on the edges of the X Box and on the curves of the controller.,2
1652,This product was supposed to come with 30 stickers. I only got 23.,2
1653,The image portrayed in this advertisement but lead you to believe that you are ordering pillows order some pillow covers and looking for pillows and ran into this advertisement once I order they came they were the same as the order I had before just covers,2
1654,To long and thin for my use. Had to return it.,2
1655,"The gold paint they used on the balloons damaged the balloons. Almost all of the balloons popped, even ones we barely filled with air. Some of the balloons had holes in them where the gold paint was.",2
1656,Ordered because of the low price. But my 2 year old goes through these all the time.,2
1657,"Rod came in a large box with ZERO packing material. Just a rod in a box, that was way too big. Lots of room to shift around. Rod tip guide was destroyed, I had to replace. Poor effort on the seller for sure.",2
1658,"The pillow is comfortable enough, but I‚Äôve only had it two months and a big hole has already ripped in the case. Good thing I only need it to last three more months. Hopefully the whole thing doesn‚Äôt disintegrate by then.",2
1659,This is much smaller than my previous companies.,2
1660,I loved this organizer until one side of each of the two handles broke after only about 4 months of use.,2
1661,"These are bikini, not hipster. Returned.",2
1662,I have been using this app for a year now and I have been liking it but recently its showing me inappropriate products. I don't know how to get this to stop or contact customer service. may have to delete app for this app for reason. I never searched for any of these items so I don't know why I'm seeing them.,2
1663,Not sure if it's the product or just a sensitive dog but she got sick 2 times out of 3 after eating just half an ear. Luckily she wasn't majorly sick but I threw them out.,2
1664,"I wanted to like this; the material it was made out of was very soft and it was a nice size for what I needed. However, this support is too soft for its own good. What good is a back SUPPORT that just squishes as you lean into it? Unfortunately, this SUPPORT did nothing but squish for me, and I returned it. If you're truly looking for SUPPORT I'd look elsewhere.",2
1665,"Ok, so I heard that this could be used in the backseat for cup holders if your vehicle doesn't have them.. um. no. The fastening slots are open at the bottom, plus they are small, so lacing a seat belt through is pointless. Comes off immediately. It's lightweight so it will fly off the seat if you stop even slightly suddenly. I'm giving 2 stars because it is sturdy, lightweight, and inexpensive- but it's fastening system means it is not secure in your car.",2
1666,I bought these thinking it would be the same as the eddy kids water bottle but bigger. The straw is different and gets clogged with air bubbles. My kids often bring me these bottles to ‚Äúfix‚Äù because the straw doesn‚Äôt work correctly,2
1667,Shoes are very slippery. There‚Äôs no grip on soles of shoes.,2
1668,They look nice. But these are not completely stainless. I haven‚Äôt even installed mine yet and there is already surface rust on the welded joints.,2
1669,Had to buy batteries for it even though there were 3 in the handle. They were dead since the light was in the on position. Not real happy about that.,2
1670,As far as nutritional value it appears to be high-quality the taste is unbearable and why I rated it at 2 star it does help to put honey in your glass with it.,2
1671,was good when worked but device manager stopped recognizing it soon after working for sometime.Would not recommend it .,2
1672,Very flimsy. I'm paranoid everytime I put a can of soda in it. It means and spreads a bit I wouldn't put a big drink in this at all and trust that it would hold it.,2
1673,The product is good. Wish it just presented it self more information.,2
1674,It states this curtain can be used as is for a shower however upon the first use it became quite saturated and this continued after my next few showers. I gave up and had to get a clear liner because I didn't want mold.,2
1675,If you have celiac or are gluten-free these vitamins are not for you. I hate swallowing pills and was disappointed when I saw the Natrol fast dissolves have wheat. So I am hoping they will let me return them.,2
1676,Corner seam opposite the hose inlet delaminates over a foot with no one near the pool in the first 40 minutes . Grandsons really liked it and hope the replacement holds up for the month of July while they are visiting. Also many holes stream outward versus into the pool as shown. Hope that is better in the second one as well.,2
1677,"I had this case ready for my new iPhone 11 Pro, which came today. The case fits around the phone nicely, but the screen sits proud of the case (above) instead of having a protective lip. In other words, if you put the phone/case face down on a table, the screen touches the table. If you have a screen protector on your phone (which you should!) it'll be even more pronounced. They just need to adjust the manufacturing parameters to make the case deeper; otherwise it's a solid case. Unfortunately, I'm going to return it and find a case that protects the screen properly.",2
1678,It looks like some of the silicon went a little bonkers in the dishwasher the first time I washed one in there. It also annoyed me how the metal flowing through the center doesn't go all the way to the end of the handle. Will return and spend my money for better quality.,2
1679,First time using this for a keto tortilla and really don't like the taste and texture. Also the dough turns purple (I read with some brands that happens) Will continue to try it in others receipts to see if I get used to it,2
1680,"It's a huge disappointment. The fabric is perfect for my needs but the quality of the threads is just terrible. I've been wearing for 6 months for regular weightlifting and it's already worn. There threads are now lose and compression is lost, even though I ordered a size larger specifically to avoid putting too much pressure on the material, since it was already pointed out in other reviews that there is an issue with durability. In comparison, my under armour compression shorts have lasted for 5 years under the same type of training. I am ordering from Canada so it doesn't make any sense to be buying these considering the extra cost of importing.",2
1681,Thisnis a mirrored window cling. It doesnt tell you this but the cling side is the clear side and the outer side is the mirrored side. This will only give you the mirrored effect to the outside if you place on the outside if your window exposed to the elements which defeats the entire purpose. A waste of my time...,2
1682,Kept saying that it wasn‚Äôt supported by Apple,2
1683,The zipper pouch in the front has a cheap zipper and mine broke off rather quickly.,2
1684,"I ordered pink locks, got purple!",2
1685,"Firstly don't believe the rating here. Fakespot.com gives it a ranking of D, which means it is very likely that there are a lot of fake good reviews here. Pro: The robot is a new category of toy, or you can even call it a pet. It go explore by itself and it does not require a phone to do so. It wakes up in the morning and wanders around and makes cute noise. It greets you when you get home (you have to make sure that he hears you and sees your face though). In summary, being autonomous is a major pro that you can't see from other products. Cons: 1: too slow in processing your command. I think the chip is from 2015. So can't expect too much in terms of processing speed. Also you can't expect it to be that smart because of this. 2. Edge detection is just NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Sometimes it just runs at full speed and falls directly off the edge. The worst part is that sometimes when it's right on the edge, it misunderstands to be on air. This causes it to act irritated and shake its arms and fall off. I don't think this is merely a problem of software. 3. It gets boring. Soon you'll realize its movements and responses are just algorithms and predictable. You get bored of it after no longer than a week. A toy is just a toy at the end. You don't want to spend $250 and eventually forget about it. In summery. It is a new and interesting experience to have a robot like this. But it is still very limited and you get bored of it very quickly. If you have extra money and really want the new experience, just get it. If you're debating whether to get it or not, don't trust the positive reviews here and forget about it -- it does not worth $250 (or even $150) yet.",2
1686,Nothing special at all about this product... the book is too small and stiff and hard to write in. The huge sticker on the back doesn‚Äôt come off and looks super tacky. I would not purchase this again. I could have just bought a journal from the dollar store and it would be basically the same thing. It‚Äôs also really expensive for what it is.,2
1687,"Not all that great, hard to adjust, field of view isn‚Äôt wonderful",2
1688,Not very sturdy. They are very fragile and thin. Sent back!,2
1689,These were smaller than expected and the material wasn't very soft as described. They are also not high-waisted as stated in the description,2
1690,"was expired, not a good product =burned back of throat.-- do not buy",2
1691,Was excellent when it first came out! Doesn't look the same,2
1692,"Cards are ok ‚Äî as pictured. But the packaging is wasteful and unnecessary. I‚Äôm sure a huge percentage of price is for the overkill packaging, which is a nightmare to open and then it gets trashed.",2
1693,"As many other people state here, once motion is detected it takes forever for it to start recording video. I had a mailman come, rattle around in my mailbox for a good minute, then walk away. The arlo only recorded the back of his head as he moved away. Definitely regret purchasing this.",2
1694,This battery doesn't last very long; the original from the phone that I bought 3 years ago last longer.,2
1695,"being 9800 mah thought they would last longer than they do and the chargers dont hold the batteries to well,they keep popping out,has taken up to 8 hrs to charge a battery, wouldn't recommend these batteries",2
1696,"After weeks of experiment, my crayfish does not eat these pellets any more. My crayfish prefer algae tablets or fish flakes. The mystery snails are not interested either. These pellets just melt away in the tank after few hours.",2
1697,"Works and light weight, but easy to get all the sheets wet and clumped together which turns all the sheets into a thin bar of soap. Not user friendly, which is a bummer because they are light weight and work well as soap.",2
1698,"ok, so I read the reviews before buying. I noticed there were a lot of people saying that it will come off on your clothes and what not. I have to fairly and honestly score it at 50% which I would think is an F.... but it is half of 100% so I gave it 3 stars. This stuff at first looked like it worked GREAT. I had restored the bad spots really well and I did it over several days adding on dye and letting dry in the hot garage. While i was moving it a little sweat fell on it from my face.... I went to wipe it off and with the sweat came due as well.... TALK ABOUT A BUMBER! So I took a wet cloth and wiped it... Just about all of it came off.... now after it was all off, the areas were a little darker than they were before... but clearly still not fixed. so I'm not sure if I need to get a darker color to just do a single coat or what? but I do know that I dont wosh to waste my money again.",2
1699,"I was looking for an inexpensive pair of Bluetooth headphones for the gym. Bought these bc of the charging case and sleek look. Didn‚Äôt expect them to sound as good as actual AirPods. Instead they are on par with headphones I‚Äôve gotten at $5 Below. Absolute rubbish. Again, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much in the sound quality department...but these are brutal. No way to enjoy music with these. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars for something with any sort of quality.",2
1700,"This book doesn't do a great job of describing the sights to see. I wish it provided more detailed descriptions, directions, and history. It does provide some sample itineraries which is nice. To me, the gold standard of travel books is Rick Steve's Italy and this doesn't come close.",2
1701,It seems to run small yet the arms run so long you have to fold the sleeves if you want to wear it. It doesn‚Äôt look good that way. I also had a hard time deciphering the front from the back because neither way for right. I‚Äôll never wear this. I have it two stars versus one because the look of it is exactly what I was hoping for.,2
1702,It arrived in good time... But I have had the messager less than a month and it no longer works... Not very impressed with the quality.,2
1703,Bought this to use for a vehicle camera and it doesn‚Äôt format properly for the camera... then doesn‚Äôt work at all after trying to use it for a tablet,2
1704,And big plot holes. Big enough to drive a truck-bomb through.,2
1705,"Fits big. I bought this dress (short sleeve). Not flattering at all. It looks like it was meant for a much older woman. It would look great on a senior who doesn‚Äôt mind wearing a shorter dress, or maybe to be comfy around the house. I plan to return it.",2
1706,1 week of use and the small candle stops recharging. Returned.,2
1707,I bought this to help keep my sons curls soft and moisture . So far I haven‚Äôt noticed any change.,2
1708,"I bought these for my son - because little boy fingernails are always filthy. I wanted something easy for him to hold (he‚Äôs three) so he can do it by himself...the problem is that these are NOT soft at all. Super stiff, hard bristles. I don‚Äôt recommend these for small children.",2
1709,Great product if it would stay in the car plug. For some reason it kept pushing out.,2
1710,They were large as described but my dogs had them falling apart in about 10 minutes. Would not reorder,2
1711,The cord broke after about 6 months of light use. It‚Äôs a shame as it sounded pretty good up until now.,2
1712,"I ordered this projector because my 3 year old BenQ started to overheat after 5 minutes of use. When I got this new BenQ, the speaker/sound from it rattled like a loose marble was in the internal speaker. I am very weary of BenQ quality after 2 projector disappointments.",2
1713,What I like the most is the easy clean up ... nothing sticks! What I like the least is that only two of the pans will work on my induction cooker. Neither small sauce pan nor the small skillet are recognizable to the cooker causing a no pan error code.,2
1714,Not as good as I expected it to be. Have to continue to pump it to make it work.,2
1715,it shows green glowing eyes light on picture but mine came blue,2
1716,"I liked it okay while it lasted... I really loved this case when I bought it. However it cracked & leaked out. In addition, the lip needs to be a little bit bigger around the edge of the phone. I‚Äôve gone through MANY, MANY Bodyguardz screen protectors with this case.",2
1717,Didn‚Äôt work for me. Second brand I‚Äôve tried.,2
1718,"I like it ok... one charging port won‚Äôt even work and one of the others is very finicky. If the cord plugged into it wiggles the wrong way, it won‚Äôt charge.",2
1719,This product died after a month. When it did work seems like there was a delay in the voice and th e people on screen talking.,2
1720,My dogs chewed them off in a couple days.,2
1721,"These just fall off your feet. If you are going to buy them anyway, get a size or two smaller.",2
1722,"Even after several hours of charging, mirror failed to turn on light. Eventually after touching the switch (???) several times, it did turn on. And then had to touch it several times again to turn it off. Did not seem to have three light intensities. ""Manual"" (?) 2 1/2 x 3 1/2"" instruction was less than helpful. Only good things to say - design is pretty and it arrived on time.",2
1723,This product had sketchy packaging. I requested a refund and now return label won't print. I need this seller to contact me ASAP. Thanks!,2
1724,"What should I say to William Painter? I ordered the sunglasses to Germany. The first thing I received was a pair of bent sunglasses. They complained that I had to pay the costs for the return myself, they are about $40. I got a new one, it has been used before. You can see from the fact that the cloth was not properly folded and the case dirty. I also had to pay the costs for the customs myself, about 60 $. So the sunglasses cost me 100 $ more. Pro: good glasses, looks good, fits well. I can't say anything about that. Contra: I find it a cheek that I got used sunglasses, especially after the first pair of glasses was bent and clearly had a mistake and my ass was sweetened by William Painter. And then there are the extra costs. Conclusion: Who does not come from the states and on gambling stands then she orders you. No recommendation",2
1725,Cute but they taste awful lol,2
1726,"Such a handy little vacuum! It's compact enough to fit under my side table to stay out of sight until it's time to vacuum. Keeps our floors clean and dust-free! ***UPDATE: After only a few days of working, the vacuum started switching directions for no reason and skipping areas of the floor and not cleaning consistently. Will be returning***",2
1727,"Not too picky about these sorts of things but the vanilla smell was too ""chemically."" Not a pleasing scent at all and the drops came out weird. Had to shake the vial pretty hard to get the drops out. Gave this one about three chances in the diffuser before giving up and throwing the vial in the trash. I ordered vanilla from somewhere else.",2
1728,Base got way too hot. Worried about a fire hazard. My daughter really wanted a lava lamp but I didn‚Äôt think it was safe enough to have something that got so hot in her room.,2
1729,"several of the balls did not squeak at all. Overall, poor quality",2
1730,"Not soft, thin, can buy the same thing at Wal-Mart for half the price",2
1731,"It was open and the bandage inside was quite crooked. Skeeved me out. The rest seemed to be sealed, but the whole thing itched like mad all night (I'd put it on prior to going to bed). It turned out I ordered the wrong item, but they aren't that different, so I'm not that impressed with the item I got. They're all big band-Aids, after all.",2
1732,"I had been wanting this wallet for a long time. But the ID windows came stained with ink and the plastic is opaque and not clear and see-through, which sort of defeats the purpose of having ID windows. The rest of the wallet looks great, but I'll have to return it because not being able to use the ID windows makes it not functional",2
1733,"It's such a shame. These brushes are perfect, but the mini one snapped and broke in less than a week. I wasn't even using it roughly just cleaning out the nipple piece on the bottle. They should either better design the mini brush to be stronger or at least give you a replacement head. Very annoying.",2
1734,"The plant shipped relatively quickly but without a heat pack. It shipped on a relatively warm day (45 degrees Fahrenheit) so it wasn't the biggest deal, but still. When I opened the package, the plant was completely wilted and had reddish-brown spots on the undersides of all the leaves. I was able to revive it, but overall I was very disappointed. I would not buy from this retailer again.",2
1735,"I will be returning this item. The bottom bracket does not adjust as per instructions. The charging indicator shows sometimes, but does not charge phone. This is a Galaxy S10 Plus, with a punk case. If the bottom actually adjusted this might have worked. Otherwise I very clever design but not fully thought out.",2
1736,"The zipper is very flimsy and broke off on my second use and return window had closed, so now I'm stuck with this useless pouch.",2
1737,Just get a days worth. Expected more,2
1738,"We ordered these because of 3 main features 1. photoelectric, 2. smoke and CO, 3 battery operated. Upon receipt it doesn't' say photoelectric anywhere. I honest to god just put out a neighbors fire last weekend and it was the early detection of photoelectric that saved his home. The alarm went off at the smoldering stage and he wasn't home but we heard the alarm, we busted in and saved the place with a large fire extinguisher. I will not chance using a detector that is not clearly photoelectric, so we immediately returned it, so not able to comment on effectiveness. Can't take the risk.",2
1739,"Even after cleaning the surface with alcohol, the 3M adhesive they have on the back of these mounts is way too thin and weak. The mount fits right, but again, the adhesive is just way too weak.",2
1740,Good price and fits nicely in small apartment. This was the second table sent to me as it was damaged by deliver driver. I don‚Äôt think it was packed very well which made it more vulnerable. The second table was also damaged but in a place less visible. It also stains very easily.,2
1741,A stone is missing from it and only used it for two days .,2
1742,They are the worst gloves,2
1743,"liked that supplier had the product I needed available ,but.... I think my 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter could have done a better job boxing my items up. I ordered 2-packs of 6 motor oil and 2- oil filters. Both oil filters had been knocked around inside the packaging box so bad that both were out of their own boxes and I had to dig debris out of the inside of the filters before installation on the vehicle. I was very reluctant to even use them or just throw them away.",2
1744,"One of my glasses came chipped, I ordered the amount that I did for a reason and now I am short one. Very very annoyed that one was chipped. But the 5 that were okay I really like.",2
1745,Works but has runout giving inconsistent pressure on the wire leading to alternating feed speed. Expect better from Hobart.,2
1746,It's cute but it's a little small,2
1747,"The fit of this shirt was great and flattering, but the material was so weird! It was loose and clingy at the same time, I don't even know how you do that. It came with tons of white marks on front, back and at the seams, either where the product was folded or stretched, it looked dirty. I have no idea if this will come out in the wash so I returned before finding out. Two stars for fit only.",2
1748,"Funky, with poor battery life. When working was fine. Replacing batteries every month is a joke. Don't bother buying this",2
1749,Well I haven't stunned anyone...yet. So I can only rate what I know. I bought this because it was small and I could attach it to my belt. The belt loop strap on the case broke in the first 4 hours I had it. So now the convienence of being able to carry it on my side is lost. Now I'm going to have to invest in a case to carry it in.,2
1750,"Depending on where your outlet is, the camera angle ends up being too low to use these outlet chargers. just a piece of plastic really that hold the camera upright.",2
1751,Could never get the bowl filled to the proper level.,2
1752,"It does not crimp well. I tried different crimping tools, all had the same results.",2
1753,"The price is great, but the length of time it works until the cable starts to short out is not nearly what I had expected. I ordered this August 18th, got it maybe a few days later. Here I am, September 13th, not even a month later, and I'm struggling to keep a charge going. Constantly having to adjust the angle of the cable and hold it completely still.",2
1754,"I have had this hat for 2 weeks now and have worn it a few days (4 or 5 days). It is super comfortable, but really lacks quality. The velcro is already separating on the back strap so I'll need to sew it up.",2
1755,"it didnt hatch by itself and the egg was broken... . the hatchimal didnt respond as the instructions mention it will my daugther love it the first day, like any other plushie but this $60 one didnt work as it suppose to do",2
1756,Nice looking watch but fell apart the first time it was worn.,2
1757,"I don't review all the books I read but I needed to review this one because I am genuinely surprised that it was rated so highly and honestly I am frustrated that I wasted my time reading it . The book is not terrible but it is predictable and boring . The author tried to add a twist to the end but like so many books I've read lately , it merely involves the author adding a different scenario and calling it a twist. But this book , like many other recent books, was not intriguing enough and did not have enough depth to make it an actual twist .",2
1758,"Have not used this product yet but want to warn people that one of the bottles opened while in transit. Handling the very soggy box and polish coated bottles was very annoying, As was losing 1/4 of what I paid for because it spilled out.",2
1759,"Unless you're looking for a diaper fit I'd pass on these. Very thick material, not streamlined and just feels bulky.",2
1760,"This was great while it worked, but just stopped working after a month. Tried new batteries, no joy....sad granddaughter.",2
1761,Picture doesn‚Äôt come out very clear. Everyone asks what it is a picture of. Very abstract,2
1762,Much smaller than you think. Would be great if they were a little bigger.,2
1763,Cheap plastic so I sent these back and got a refund. I would not recommend these shoes especially in the summer. Flimsy and cheap material. Seem generic.,2
1764,Seemed more like a 2 ply rather than a 12 ply. Much thinner than other 12 ply brands I've purchased.,2
1765,Sprayed unwanted grasses on a Saturday and 5 days later no grasses are dead,2
1766,"difficult to use, especially on yourself. asked my husband to try to braid my hair with it, but it didn't turn out.",2
1767,"They're cute, but order 2 sizes up! I ordered 1 size up and it was too small for my daughter.",2
1768,"I have ordered these several times but in the last batch seems the cut out is different now, and the mask is so wide and then the nose piece is shorter so it doesn't even cover my nose. Won't be ordering again.",2
1769,This bulb is more of a turquoise color than blue. The neighbors made fun of it. :(,2
1770,"This was a disappointment, it breaks off allll the time while applying so annoying. Will not buy this again.",2
1771,The adhesion isn't as good as I'd like my 14month old learned how to pull it off of our fireplace. Now I have trash.,2

1776,So boring I couldn't finish it.,2
1777,"Look, it MIGHT bump you into ketosis but it tastes like rotten mangos and smells like feet. I don't expect my supplements to taste good. I want them to be effective. I never puked while drinking it, but I did have to plug my nose and down it like my life depended on it. It's that bad. The seller says they are addressing the odor problem through a combination of solutions. I would advise future purchasers to make sure this issue has been resolved before purchasing, and keep in mind the taste is going to be rough...but the price is right and it's effective.",2
1778,sound only comes out of one side,2
1779,"Diamonds were insufficient to finish the painting., did not line up right and square diamonds were mixed in with the rounds. Very dissatisfied with this painting",2

1781,it worked great till the handle snapped in half and the screw the loosen/ tighten the amount of movement for the handle was broken. super upset:/ this happened the first time i got it out to test it with my canon t5.,2

1786,2 stars because overall purchase was good. I think the YETI cooler is overpriced and overrated !,2
1787,Shipping was fast but I am kinda disappointed with this product because it didn‚Äôt work out for me. The price is cheap but the quality is cheap but you get what you paid for. This product didn‚Äôt provide a strong thumb grip. It is still slippery and just didn‚Äôt function as it is suppose to be. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product if you are a serious gamer.,2
1788,"It was pretty when it first came in but soon the design started to chip off and it got dirty so easy. And I keep my phone in my pocket or on my desk all the time, shouldn‚Äôt be that easy to get dirty. However my phone was dropped a couple of times with the case and it never shattered.",2

1791,"This product did not arrive as described. Only tried on the top and it is WAY to small, not consistent with measurements shown. I don‚Äôt think I was sent the correct item and there‚Äôs not option to return for correct item. Disappointed!",2
1792,"Nice shiny smooth material, long enough, but the skirt fits super tight and slides up. Seriously, for the size they made the shorts underneath, which fit perfect on a 5‚Äô8‚Äô‚Äô size 18, the skirt is like a super tight pencil skirt, the skirt is more a size 14-16. It might work better if I lose another 10 lbs, but then the shorts might be too baggy. And the inside front has this white secondary panel. I guess it‚Äôs for not showing anything on the front? But it‚Äôs stupid and super itchy and makes the suit fit all thick and bunchy on the front, and it‚Äôs waist band to knees, left outer seam to right outer seam. The back is smooth and silky and comfortable. Not gusseted, so it could crawl up if you get it fit too tight. I‚Äôm cutting out the weird white liner to see if that helps anything, and maybe the skirt wont slide up when it‚Äôs wet, or I may tack it to the side seam on the shirts. And no drawstring at the waist, which fits well on a small waist/ big booty combo, but might get heavy and pull down in water. Other than that, it‚Äôs a good length, hits the top of my kneecap/crease at the back of my knee.",2
1793,How can I give it a review when It never shipped to my house?,2
1794,The water socks protected my feet but the were weird feeling and they seem as if worn too much my toes may push through the fabric.,2
1795,Threw mine away after using it twice.,2
1796,"The comforter was very gray, not at all blue as depicted in the picture. I didn't even take it out of the bag because the color was so different from what I was expecting. Quality looked great - I wish they actually had a blue one!",2
1797,I bought these boxes to move. They look great but they broke in several places just from picking them up -and the handles came off and they are hard to get back in place. I would not recommend for the price.,2
1798,"Pretty thin, weak chair. Not really much good to say about it. It's cheap enough but if you're looking for something super sturdy, keep looking.",2
1799,The packaging inside the mailer was damaged and opened when I received it in the mail. I have no way of knowing if the sticks have been damaged until I open one to use it.,2
1800,"I bought these for crawling insects and after about a month, I'm still seeing crawling insects. Granted some are upside down and kicking and some are dead, but there are still some that are crawling/running around at night. I've had to buy insecticides which I was trying to avoid.",2
1801,"These are cool and my kids love them, but they got holes in the seams right away. Disappointed with that.",2
1802,"while the price was excellent and the tool for holding the bands was very good, the bands themselves flew apart about a min. after you started sanding with them. The first one I thought was a fluke but after 10 or so came apart I was concerned . Without eye protection someone could have a serious accident ,I was hit twice in the face as they flew apart. They are separating at the seam and the band of grit is coming loose from the belt. I don't know if somewhere along the line they got wet,or they are not rated for the speed of a simple dremel band rotary tool. The cheapest single speed tools on the market still go at the 25,000 rpm range ,( which was the speed I was using). If these bands are not rated for at least that speed they are no good for much of anything.",2
1803,Was way bigger than anticipated. Not as pretty as the pic,2
1804,"I ordered 3 different palettes, only this one came broken. Well over half of them were obliterated, and all colors I wanted to use. So be very careful if you order, make sure you open over a surface that can be cleaned....I opened mine over light colored pants while sitting on a light colored blanket, SUPER BAD IDEA. Only reason I‚Äôm giving 2 stars is because there are still a couple of colors to use, and they seem to be of good quality!",2
1805,"With a brand like Little Tikes, I am shocked at the quality. The handle bar is very loose and wiggles when you try to push. This makes it challenging to pivot when needing to turn. There is also a defect on the handle where the plastic is super sharp. The size of the seat barely fits my one year old and does not look comfortable. I had the Step2 car for my daughter and am upset I didn‚Äôt order the same for my son. The only reason I didn‚Äôt was because I liked the idea of the canopy!",2
1806,"I actually burned in it and now it sticks where it burned, disappointed but still use it",2
1807,"Let me first explain why I chose this model over others. I don't like the vent clips - I do not think prolonged exposure to hot or cold direct forced air is good for the phone. Dash mounts (even the magnetic ones) require putting adhesive on your dash - no thank you. Windshield mounts are hit and miss in my experience, they either work really well and won't come down. others you hit a bump and the damn thing falls off the windshield. So I figured this may be a viable option. Perhaps if I were a foot taller (I am 5'4""). If placed where they suggest it impedes my view of the road. My best bet is in the middle, where it is slightly harder to reach, but at least if I'm using GPS it's easier to view than it is sitting in my cupholder or lap.",2
1808,"Made from foam, but I didn‚Äôt expect much for the price",2
1809,"Felt, need I say more? From the picture I thought I was buying a soft, silky flower.",2
1810,The stickers are too small and the quality is not good.,2
1811,Was given for a Christmas present. Didn't last 3 months and stopped working,2
1812,Bought this set because i purchased the pots and pans set which are made in Italy. Unboxed this and stamped largely on the bottom is MADE IN CHINA. Also the enamel and ceramic coating looks like it will chip if you blow on it. Overal look of the set is much cheaper looking than the tramontina cook set i purchased. May send it back but this sure explains the low price tag...,2
1813,"Took too long to ship, and assembly instructions were unclear and a poor photo copy so pictures couldn't be used either. Once assembled, they barely spin, only in high(er) winds. Not at all satisfied.",2
1814,"Difficult to open tools. Tried oiling, didn't help much. Had to use a screwdriver to pry tools open.",2
1815,I bought this for my son‚Äôs new bed but am sending it back immediately! It‚Äôs very soft and a little plush but has plastic in it so it‚Äôs So noisy!!,2
1816,Don't buy. Very loud. And wont show up in my DVR settings. Crap..,2
1817,Didn‚Äôt keep my hands warm at work stocking frozen foods,2
1818,Bought this and upon opening seemed cheap. The frame would twist and wasn‚Äôt made the best. Was hesitant to let my baby play with it.,2
1819,These are freaking adorable! I hung pictures from them. I had these rated a 5 star when i first got them up until I‚Äôve had them for two days and the lights went out. Changed the batteries & still won‚Äôt work. All the clips worked fine & it was cute. But the whole point was to have a suttle light & they stopped working. Return started.,2
1820,Really sad because I love this but when I received it it had a huge bubble down the middle where it had been creased. Saw another review with the same problem but was hoping it was a fluke. Guess not. I‚Äôll be returning it.,2
1821,The mic works great once plugged in with a phantom power supply. The part that you insert the arm into the base came off. Seems like it was only held on by glue. So sadly that seems like poor quality.,2
1822,Is cute but to bulky did like it,2
1823,the book was too expensive. can buy it much cheaper. needed to go Amazon Prime because I was gifting it. check with other recovery sites and find the better price is my suggestion.,2
1824,Should have listened to the reviews. The bill is half the size in length of a regular baseball cap.,2
1825,"one of them died on the first rain, one is still working good.",2
1826,First time ordering from this company. Not packed well at all All 3 caps were broken.,2
1827,I have a 2005 Lexus RX330 and it did not fit right. I had to remove the back of the battery pack for it to fit and I had to sand down the inside where the key goes because it wouldn‚Äôt shut. I made it work but I won‚Äôt be buying this one again,2
1828,Surprisingly ineffective product in very nice packaging. The reagents aren't anywhere near enough for 40 tests. The plunger for filtering simply doesn't work as described. I actually have a background in laboratory techniques so I was taken aback. I had run my samples through a mesh break them down too. Oh well.,2
1829,"package tore when arrived, case they were in not put together very well had to respect it",2
1830,"I have a Moto Z Force. The audio works great and I can control volume and pause/mute from my headset. But, the charger port does not work on either adapter in the two-pack. Could have bought better. Returned. Most, if not all, of the 5 star ratings are fake. You can tell by seeing what other things they have rated on their profiles. Many of them are the same products rated on the same days. Clearly fake.",2
1831,"I'm not sure why, but the first two times I used these they adhered fine and every other pair has been too slippery to really stay where they belong. I would have rated them higher if they all stayed in place like the first two pairs did. I always have limited expectations for products that are basically glorified moisturizing, so while I wouldn't say these do anything dramatic, they are at least pleasant to use - when they are not slipping.",2
1832,"I loved playing this game, but it wont update on my Kindle. It updates on my phone. Very frustrating!",2
1833,It‚Äôs very bad i buy one it‚Äôs not working,2
1834,It's was nice but had a en hole in it up in the front of it.,2
1835,"Color was not rose gold as per the picture. It is almost write gold. Inside silver is as expected. Size is good. Good condition, good terminations. Disappointed only with the color.",2
1836,Several pieces on this truck broke off within 6 minths.,2
1837,NOT A THERMAL COVER---NOT DUAL LAYER AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE---but it does work for a cover,2
1838,"Two problems, first of all, the mounting holes for the speaker grilles DO NOT line up with the speaker mounting holes into the box. Second problem, how do you mount the crossover network??? There are No holes in the housing to mount it. They should have included a tube of silicone glue with the speakers to glue the grilles to the speaker box and glue the crossover network to the speaker box",2
1839,"Did not receive a black band. Reached out to their customer support, have not heard back.",2
1840,This was the end result after not even 2 weeks. The idea and concept is cute but just didn‚Äôt work for me: maybe because the paint on my walls? I‚Äôm really not sure but these peeled right off the wall and took my paint with it. Btw it will not hold a swiffer mop,2
1841,The material was cheap and ripped after a few wears and washes - will not purchase again,2
1842,"The board is nice (mine was definitely used since it had scuffs and a cut in the foam mat on top), but the pump is crap! I wanted to exchange the pump (I was ok with the board), but was unable to get in touch with anyone... and did not get a response to my question on exchanging the pump. I kept the board (hassle to send back) and bought an electric pump. Hindsight: there are others on amazon for the same or less with better reviews.",2
1843,"These seemed to only work for a few hours before they either become so saturated that they make no difference, or the adhesive starts to peel off/come loose. I personally have had better luck with sweatproof undershirts.",2
1844,These leggings run small. I would recommend ordering at least 1 size larger than your normal size. They are very well made. An FYI the white legging is transparent.,2
1845,It went on ok but tube dried out fast,2
1846,not what I was looking for these were extremely thin,2
1847,"Three of the lids broke after only a few months of use. Very disappointing, and we will not buy from this manufacturer again.",2
1848,I didn't like it I received the wrong product,2
1849,All meats and seafood stick to this grill. I have to put oil on the grill to prevent sticking. They need to remove 'non-stick' from the description because it's not.,2
1850,I've had the chair for two days and love it but unfortunately I've had to add air to the ball at the end of each day. I'm only 120 pounds and I don't believe I should have to add air that frequently,2
1851,"Might be better for a beginner, new to the industry. Wasn't very informative, or what I was looking for at all. If you have any retail background the information will be reminders at best.",2
1852,"I love the idea of Jack on my socks, the were way too small. I did give them to my daughter, she wares them.",2
1853,"I thought that these stones would look like my original stones, which were partly clear and very pretty. These stones are a solid color, and different size. They do not look like the picture.",2
1854,I really like the concept of this belt and how it works. As a plus size person I find this belt easy to use and tighten. But I am giving a two star review for two reasons. 1) the buckle is very heavy for its size. Not sure if it‚Äôs how it is designed but feels heavy and bulky 2) the class that holds the buckle on slips. I like my belt tight but the teeth just dig in and the ‚Äúleather‚Äù just pulls and stretches.,2
1855,"THis crib is adorable and my 3 year old daughter loves it, but similar to what other people had said, when we put it together the rail split in 3 or 4 places. I don‚Äôt really want to go to the trouble of disassembling and returning it, but I‚Äôll be contacting the seller/amazon.",2
1856,There is a recall on this unit due to fire hazard. How do I go about returning this?,2
1857,Works well when it connects. Fails to connect to my iPad about 50% of the time.,2
1858,"When I was putting on the passenger side cover, it ran in two places like nylons. I contacted the seller and they said they would ship another.. so I thought ok. I tries putting on the covers and they did not fit properly, so I packed the merchandise back up. I never did receive the other cover anyways. I went ahead and refunded the product. I lost $15, not including taxes. Very disappointed in this seller. I would never buy from this company again. Live and learn.",2
1859,Not very durable. It‚Äôs less than a week after Christmas and the blender is barely holding together.,2
1860,"Very fun game at first but after playing for three or four days, the game crashed and I completely lost all my save data. So all that time went straight out and I lost everything Very disappointing.",2
1861,The large pot is too small,2
1862,The chocolate always arrived like it melted and was in clumps....each time I ordered it.,2
1863,I‚Äôve had these for less than a month and the lid won‚Äôt stay closed. Very disappointed.,2
1864,"To hard in the shoes. No arch support, super flat inside the shoe.",2
1865,"Tastes really bad, like chewing on a Quinoa bar. Has the texture of rotten watermelon. The carb content is low which is nice for Atkins dieters, but it's just foul.",2
1866,"These chargers ARE CRUCIAL for the Shibari hand wand massagers, BUT VERY CHEAPLY MADE AND QUICKLY BREAK DOWN AT THE JACK AND GET SHORTS OR OUTRIGHT STOP WORKING.",2
1867,I like the fact that it provided decent padding but the downside is it kept slipping out of place. Although it has a drawstring and elastic the straps every time I sat in it it would slide to the side. That could definitely lead to a fall.,2
1868,The price of the item was too much and the quality wasn‚Äôt worth it,2
1869,Could not finish it let alone get into it,2
1870,Very small. Will be canceling subscription. I only have 1 cat and he always looks very uncomfortable in it.,2
1871,"Item mute the sound, but it also changed it (not good). Additionally, the seam between the 2 pieces was loose and rattled anytime I played it. -Down 3 stars- This will be a return item. I think it could be better and for the price I gave 2 stars.",2
1872,"Tires unglued and separated from both rear tires on both the inside and outside of rim within 30 minutes . Traction and handling were nice for 2wd rustler. Glue failed , reglue failed , cannot recommend for 3S.",2
1873,"This was supposed to come with a screen protector and did not. It‚Äôs also pretty flimsy, so I will be returning this.",2
1874,Good value but difficult to use..tape gets stuck and hard to cut,2
1875,"Money refunded , only r",2
1876,"Very nice suspenders but mine are defective. One of the clips is missing the nylon teeth insert and does not hold onto pants. This makes them useless. However, if they were not defective, they would have been great suspenders. I will try my luck again likely.",2
1877,"The product was so hot when I took it out of the box, we were in the midst of a heatwave, and I'm sure it damaged the vitamins. No luck with them so far.",2
1878,"They‚Äôre comfortable to stand on but they don‚Äôt seem to fit right in any boot or shoe I have. The sides have weird flares and the sole itself is very thick, taking room from the shoe and squishing my foot.",2
1879,I wore these bras about 2 times each by the 3rd time the underwire came out. I don't recommend buying these bras. They're a waste of money,2
1880,Packaging was not great and one of the knives are bent,2
1881,"Extremely long shipping time from China, I placed the Order, saw how long it was going to take, tried to cancel and it wouldn‚Äôt let me. Now that I have it, it‚Äôs not the quality as other bits",2
1882,I placed 2 suits in a garment bag and seam on the side split open. Unfortunately it is now too late to send them back.,2
1883,Not a travel bag. Very light material. Maybe inside a suit case but whats the sense in that. Returned it immediately.,2
1884,"The dish rack looks really nice and is spacious, perfect size for a condo sized kitchen. However, we received the product in defective condition. One side of the clear silverware container was broken and therefore the utensil holder could not be used. This pretty much makes the dishrack useless for me, and so I need to get a replacement. I went to Bed Bath and Beyond to buy a new utensil holder for the dish rack.",2
1885,It worked great for a couple of days and then it made a loud popping noise and shut down only works in reverse. I tried to get tech support (chat) but that's a joke after filling out the information the tech person asks me to repeat what I just wrote and he/she want's to know how I'm doing and the english was awful trying to figure out what he/she meant when asking questions. So I decided to return it and by a better one.,2
1886,Works well but not nearly loud enough for a truck.,2
1887,Not anough coverage across the chest. My tits hang out,2
1888,Cut and material are terrible. I would have returned these but my son saw them and wouldn‚Äôt let go :-),2
1889,The quality is awful. Don‚Äôt recommend.,2
1890,"Weird, it arrived in a plastic bag not the box as pictured",2
1891,Way overpriced. It came half way full with only 10 servings. I bought it because all natural but the taste is gross and I don‚Äôt really feel anything different than coffee. I‚Äôve already used it so I‚Äôm not sure if I can return it or get my money back now. Disappointed as I was looking forward to a pre workout that wasn‚Äôt full of chemicals.,2
1892,Take too long for delivery.,2
1893,Torch seems to be doing fine for a while. Now the butane continues even after I release and it occasionally doesn't come out in torch form. Spits and sputters the butane out and makes more of a dragon type flame.,2
1894,Easy to assemble a looks nice... but very poor quality. The rod disconnected from the base and fell over after only a few weeks of use.,2
1895,Jan 28 2021 expiration date on new cannister. This cannister does not have same fruity flavor as the expired cannister of teas I finally used up. First cannister I purchased had purple lid. Same tea flavor. Very disappointing. I wont purchase again .,2
1896,"Fortunately, I won‚Äôt have to read anymore. Really a slog with 2D characters and predictable situations.",2
1897,"I should have gotten a stronger coffee to mild for me, maybe next time",2
1898,"Great seat however mine came with 2 different nuts to connect the seat to the bowl, one of which was HUGE and didn‚Äôt fit the bolt at all. Super upset! I had already pulled apart the old seat and started installing this one when I realized it so now I‚Äôm hoping none of my 3 kids break it or fall off before I can properly secure it.",2
1899,The case was great and does exactly what it's supposed to do until the plastic holding the tablet started to disintegrate. I've had this cover since November and in December the corners started breaking. I showed it to my husband just to make sure I wasn't seeing things. As he was holding it plastic from one corner fell off into his hand. I now have 3 corners that are coming apart. Bought two more of these cases and both have the plastic corners cracking and crumbling off.,2
1900,"This should not be sold as a fitness tracker. I have had it on 36 hrs now and it says I haven't slept at all, the steps are very in accurate and the camera button does not work. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because so far the time has stayed correct and if I have bluetooth on it lets me know calls and texts but dont try to read texts because they only fash across the screen once and there is not a way to look at them again. Since I paid $20 for it, I do not find it reasonable to pay shipping to return it. I will just use it as a watch until it dies. Nice job on making a slim design watch that actually fits my small wrists.",2
1901,I hope that the seller sends me a new and clean book because the center page is crinkled up really badly. So badly you cant really read the page. I know it is only technically 2 pages the front and back of pages 219 and 220. Please send me the unwrinkled version as this was suppose to be a gift for someone.,2
1902,"I bought this to help with the glide of my gaming mice. The tape is good for a few days but then begins to peel and causes friction between the mouse and mouse pad, causing me to then remove the tape and reapply. Would not recommend.",2
1903,For some reason the sound keeps cutting out on the DVD..it's getting really frustrating and I don't think it's caused by my computer. Wanted to know if others were having this problem as well.,2
1904,"This runs small,order a size up and it is ‚Äúok ‚Äú,but not comfortable-Plus it has those tiny little snaps and takes a few minutes to get them attached-I wear it because it does work well for me , but I don‚Äôt love it-It‚Äôs stiff and uncomfortable just dosent have the flexibility I like-I‚Äôm sure it would be hot in summer I-Spanx is much more comfortable for every day even though it‚Äôs more expensive-",2
1905,I got this bottle for drinking my essential oils. Must use a glass or stainless steel container. There is a small plastic ring in the lid that can not withstand the oils. So now that ring is gone and the lid won‚Äôt seal.,2
1906,Love the drink itself however only received 21 of 24 cans and they were all dented and hard to open-also just thrown in an open box and sticky. Other 2 orders were not like this though.,2
1907,"I have used quite a few different lash growth serums, some more expensive than others, and this one is not great-- especially for the price. If you want real results you are better off paying for the R+F lash serum because that will actually work.",2
1908,I‚Äôm having a hard time getting in to it. Tried to return but it cost to return.,2
1909,"It felt like reading a college text book. Way to much detail, he could have simplified things. He‚Äôs all over the place, not a consistently written book. I like Tom Friedman but this book was a waste of time. Not worth reading.",2
1910,"I'm glad this pack came with two screens because the first one cracked when all I did was put it on. The second screen I got on. I liked that the corners/ edges are covered which is why I bought this one. However, there is a noticeable lack in response from the touch screen with this cover.",2
1911,Regular legos are not compatible with this table!!!! I would not have bought it if I knew that :(,2
1912,"I wanted to like this movie because of the important and meaningful context of child abduction, but I couldn't watch the whole thing, I had to start skipping parts due to the main character not being likable, lots of flash editing transitions that you can do in imovie, and just drawn out redundant scenes. If you want to watch an unforgettable similar movie, try ""Dearest"" - best child abduction and Chinese movie I've seen..",2
1913,"Material is too thin, cheap and itchy. I bought a pair of leggings from Costco and the material was thicker than this jeggings. Definitely going back, too bad was so excited about it.",2
1914,Haven't used long dog seems to drink more while taking.,2
1915,Clock has nice features but short in circuitry after 8 months makes it unusable.,2
1916,The icons came scratched up on several places. I don't have the time to send it back and wait for another one. They're noticeable when the lights are off. It looks so pretty on my desk when it's on . If it were in new condition I would rate it 5 stars. It's almost as if it were used. The scratches look more noticeable in person than in pictures. Don't get me wrong it looks really nice. I'm just disappointed it arrived like this.,2
1917,The screen protector was ok until I dropped my phone two days ago. I used this product along with a Mophie case. My phone cracked in the corner and the screen protector did not stop my actual phone screen from cracking. The screen protector also cracked when the phone dropped. Note: My phone only was dropped about three feet.,2
1918,The materiel of the bra is very rough.,2
1919,Phone arrived beyond dead and took forever to turn on. Appears to function fine. Came with a case and screen protector which masked the issues. The phone is in TERRIBLE shape. It looks like someone threw it in a box of gravel and shook it for an hour. I have never seen a phone with so many scratches and flaws to the body. I‚Äôm scared to take the screen protector off because of what I‚Äôll find under there. This is not a full refurbish. This is a factory reset and maybe a quick function test.,2
1920,"today i had a stubborn can., i pulled out the p38 and what an epic failure. my old one that actually came from the military is far better. very disappointing..........",2
1921,"Cheap garbage thin plastic. Tiny dust collection bin that contains a filter, makes sense BUT pet hair doesn't want to come out. Have to stick your fingers into the open collection bin to out it loose. That's messy and gross. Hose/wand removal from handle body is awkward and the cheap plastic construction makes you baby it. Hose suction is less than impressive anyway. The handle is difficult to lock into the upright storage position and regularly, when you think it is locked up, it isn't, and therefore falls hard to the floor. It steers like a dream! ....yeah that doesn't make up for its shortfalls. Not even close really. Returned this piece of junk and bought a Shark with a nice big dust collection bin/cylinder.",2
1922,My fault for not looking at the dimensions before purchasing. It's SO small.,2
1923,"I just got these pens... literally out of the box and 3/4 of them aren't completely filled with ink. One of the blue ones (see photo) has so little ink that it looks completely empty. This was not a cheap set compared to others available, but the colors looked nice and I thought I'd give them a try. At almost $30, I should have just stuck to the cheaper sets. At least it wouldn't have cost me as much to replace them when they ran out of ink.",2
1924,"These nesting dolls are very pretty. Very nice work and that is why I'm giving them 2 stars. However, the second doll seems to have been shellacked shut. It is impossible to open. Even my husband tried prying them. It is impossible. I think it is ridiculous that the purpose of this toy is to be able to be opened (by a child) and they cannot even be opened by a grown man. I bought them even though I saw that in someone else's review, and I wish I didn't because they cannot be returned. So, now I'm stuck with a set of nesting dolls and I can only open the first one. Totally disappointing. **Update: Amazon came through for me and made it right and I really did appreciate that. Thank you, Amazon.",2
1925,Band is way too short! My sister lost it within a week since it kept falling off. So disappointed.,2
1926,"I have super thick, coarse, and curly hair - this moisturizer has too much protein in it, or something. My hair became super tangled - I had to shampoo my hair several days in a row (I normally only shampoo once a week). Can‚Äôt use this product.",2
1927,Don't like the whole silk nylon feel of this item way too hot for summer and uncomfortable for something that's supposed to clean to you again very small not for thicker women if you have a flat stomach you maybe to pull this off Constable however it is a hot material so I would recommend wearing it at night when you're going out or something is not something that you would think of cloth that you can wear during a summer day and just don't some cute flip flops it's very hot very tight and weird material,2
1928,"Comforter looks very thin. Does not look like a full even though it was advertised as one! It has not been washed or used yet since it is a gift. Hopefully the stitching & color hold up. I am worried about the quality of this product just from looking at it. I really hope it can handle being used on a child's bed, since that it what it was intended for.... frequent wear & tear and frequent washing.... we'll see..... The price was a little high for such a thin ""comforter"", claiming to be for a full size bed. This barely covers a full!",2
1929,Well since I'm sitting here watching Christmas programs this morning I might as well give this product review do not buy I repeat do not buy the first three days one of them fell apart on the 7th Day the second one fell apart I'm sorry for the bad review but I call them as I see them I will not buy any of these again for those of you just reading this I strongly suggest that you get the one that is the screw-in not the bayonet it totally sucks,2
1930,This book arrived bent out of shape and with a some type of stain on it.,2
1931,I was sooo excited to order these for my children. I also ordered a set for myself. After using one I found it was hard to slide the closer but chalked it up to the fact it was new. My husband used it and cracked the slide the first time he tried to open it. It is also very hard to keep open when you are trying to pour into it. Great idea but it needs some more work on the quality of the slide and shape of the bag.,2
1932,"This book was helpful for my review; however, I failed on the test. There were tons of practice questions for each chapter, but they are very easy to the point that you don‚Äôt really need to buy this book. When I took the TEAS, the questions on the actual TEAS were very different. Some reviewers said that the question on the book were similar on the actual TEAS, but they were wrong. I studied the cardiovascular system intensively, and there is no one single question about the heart at all. The English portion on this book is very different on the actual TEAS. In the book, it focuses on grammar and spelling. On the actual TEAS, it is more on ‚Äòif the sentence is written correctly?‚Äô Overall, I don‚Äôt think that this book is worth buying. Like I said, the questions on the book are very easy. They are more on common sense. Compare to the actual TEAS exam, you will have to think and reread the question again.",2
1933,The suction cups suck. They don‚Äôt work. Net part is fine with suction cups I bought separate,2
1934,How can this be bed bug proof If it doesn't completely close the mattress in. I was disappointed that the mattress cover didn't completely closed the mattress inside it just went on top that's no protection at all.,2
1935,"The dilators are almost perfect, but the numbers on the sides are just bothersome enough to prevent going past their location near the midpoint.",2
1936,"They seem to feel okay, well constructed. After wearing for a few hours they slip down my feet and don't do anything for the arch support. I would not recommend these if you have small feet like mine. I wear a size 6.",2
1937,Great material and condition but the medical tag part keeps opening and I lost all my contact information that was in there the very first day. The clip alone is not very strong.,2
1938,"I asked the seller if the color was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold, darker. Nothing close! The set looks VERY cheap. It's super shiny yellow with lots of CZs, even shinier. Looks great on the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.",2
1939,"This is so weird. In normal light it looks like I have a pink and an orange but under UV light they are the same! No pink! I drew a pink line using a paint stick from another brand so you can see what pink should look like and know it's not just my camera. Pink is my most used color so I'm a bit upset about this. Red, orange, and pink are basically all orange. No point in calling them red or pink. The white isn't as bright as I would have hoped. The rest of the colors are all great and I like how easily these paints wash off. I just wits there were a pink. I guess the purple will suffice.",2
1940,they work horribly to hold hats the pegs are not long enough . Do not use for hats if you regularly use hats .,2
1941,"Stickiness is perfect, but not comfortable wearing it. Eyes felt a bit pricking. Unlike my other eyelid tapes, don‚Äôt feeling anything on eyes.",2
1942,I like this product but it‚Äôs definitely made cheaply and the cash register can be a pain to open sometimes.,2
1943,From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games. Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren‚Äôt smart in knowing what direction you‚Äôre trying to take. Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways. Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense. I have not enjoyed this game. I do not plan on finishing it. The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.,2
1944,"There's an education problem in America, yes, but no shortage of STEM educated. I find this a red herring, and, more importantly, does not offer solutions since it's barking up the wrong tree. The fact that this author is anonymous speaks to the issue: the all too powerful industry, who're after US' elite entitlement: indentured labor.",2
1945,These shed too much.,2
1946,Looks good. It's not completely level. Only 3 wheels touch the ground out of 4 at anytime.,2
1947,Its a shame cause I love the style and color of this bag but the lining is so cheap and ripped after very little use.,2
1948,"Insert for between was hard to put in place. Once in, it was lumpy. May fall into place after use, but not as expected.",2
1949,Stays on good but sharpening it is painful as it just breaks apart so you lose most of pencil. Bought 2 times not again,2
1950,"Great packaging and a nice piece of glass. Was happy until the edge of the glass starting coming apart after 3 weeks. No drops, no impacts with my new iPhone X, the glass literally just chipped off where I pull up from the bottom of the screen to go ‚Äúhome‚Äù. Looks like the glass is just poorly laminated or whatever would cause this.",2
1951,This thing never worked for me. I tried it multiple times with same results. The way it removes the hair is not efficient. You have to use a lot of cream and it wouldn't remove the hair as close as a trimmer and still grows back just as thick.,2
1952,Packaging was terrible. Liquid container just thrown in box that bounced around in transit with no protection. Would not purchase again.,2
1953,This literally fell off a little over a month after I got it,2
1954,Monitor size was great I liked the picture quality but image was stuck in split view with only one camera purchased,2
1955,Really disappointed. So small for the price!,2
1956,The case has great protection however it turns yellow after a few months of use.,2
1957,"The shoes are decent, mine came damaged as well as the packaging being damaged but I need should now and can't replace them. I'd recommend a different brand honestly.",2
1958,"Pay very close attention to the size. It‚Äôs huge and shockingly HEAVY. Will easily scratch countertops if not extremely careful. Mine came without the pestle, so had to return, even though I was excited to use it.",2
1959,I am a size 10 and I ordered a L. It is huge and boxy on me. The sleeves are even too long ( I am 5'7 so its not that I have short arms). Maybe a small would have fit better. I would return it but I didn't try it on when I got it and now it is too late.,2
1960,The LED high beams aren't very high beam... they aren't even that bright the low beams are bright and look out farther than the leds!!,2
1961,Lasted only a day! They are cool and my kids love them but get sad that they come off or look like poop the next day.,2
1962,Ordered this for my son. We waited for 3weeks to arrive. The left side where the whole for the garter is torn so we had to tape it. The black paint was erased after a week. This mask is really thin.,2
1963,"Worked nicely for 2 weeks but now it doesn't always charge. When it did charge, it was as fast as using a normal USB cable but usually 20-30 minutes slower than a fast charge cable directly plugged into the phone. I like the upright design of it but I recommend investing more money in a higher quality product.",2
1964,"I did not like this. First mistake was not really reading the details or description. Second mistake was purchasing it. The brush is way too small, even for me being a beginner.",2
1965,"Poor design in utilizing the phones features, and no amount back and forth with vendor will change that. It cheap for a reason... You invested a fair amount in the phone, so do the same for the case.",2
1966,Require too much assembly and received broken parts due to poor packaging.,2
1967,Not as expected. Heavy but not what I wanted. Thought it was for back seat. My fault for not studying the ad further,2
1968,Please revise the app... need this smart bulb to turn on a couple of hours before dusk and to go off an hour after dawn... also add.the ability to cause the bulb to flash to help first responders find my house in the event of an emergency,2
1969,Not impressed... Does not work,2
1970,"This case looks nice and gives the phone a bit of grip, which makes it less likely to slip off from slick surfaces, but it ripped within a couple weeks of having it on my phone.",2
1971,"A lot of our perceptions of how something works for you, is how you feel after using it. I waited about a month after finishing a bottle and before writing a review. I went Keto at the time of starting this product. I took it once a day at different times throughout the day to see if it mattered how I felt. I can‚Äôt say I felt differently, unlike the feeling I got with brain octane or unfair advantage. Sometimes these things take a while to kick in or it can be a cumulative benefit. Therefore, I can neither confirm or deny it‚Äôs advantages.",2
1972,Not impressed... pain in ass putting cuffs back in.,2
1973,"It would not hold up my iphone 8 plus, even though it said it supports an 8 plus. Once on the vent and my iphone is placed in the holder, it bends forward because it is not strong enough to hold my phone up to see.",2
1974,Love it Changed my mind... now I have two broken bracelets . Waiting for someone to contact me... please!!!,2
1975,Too thin but will do in a crunch.,2
1976,"Doesn't hold enough. Maybe for a guy, but it would have taken up too much room in suitcase and didn't hold everything like my current one.",2
1977,"I love to plant and grow trees, but this one is very low in germ. It been almost a month and I see nothing grow. I live in zone 5 and follow what they say but see nothing so far. Will change review if something happen.",2
1978,This is just ok! Makes a buzzing noise while plugged in. My 12.00 toaster was just as good. Nothing special about this one,2
1979,"Flashlight is lightweight and relatively flimsy. Bought for occasional use around the house and emergency use in case of power outage since I already have two 19.2 batteries for my drills. Have only used one of the lights a few times and the bulb burnt out, maybe had 30 minutes total use. I didn't drop the light or abuse it so was pretty surprised by the short life of the bulb. Went on Amazon to buy replacement bulbs and found the reviews to be poor and that these bulbs routinely burn out quickly. Certainly wouldn't buy Craftsman bulbs - very expensive. Will buy an off-brand bulb at $1 a bulb or an LED replacement if it has good reviews.",2
1980,Bought for college age child...says it doesn‚Äôt cook evenly. Outside gets burnt while inside still uncooked. Very disappointed. Would return if possible.,2
1981,"Installed ok, and everything opened as should have, but was not able to use as Windows tried to tag it as official Office, and therefore couldnt open to use it. Might have just been an issue on my end, But didnt work.",2
1982,I was very excited to use these but found very quickly that they were crap! The salt got stuck under the cover and every time you turn the cover to adjust what size holes you are using the salt poured out and even when all the holes were closed it did the same. The salt also got stuck in the cap so when you opened to refill the excess salt got all over. I threw them out. I guess you get what you paid for.,2
1983,Isn't a child small size,2
1984,"What a disappointment. If you have a Note 8, and you use any type of protective plastic on it, you may not be able to close the holster with the zipper. It will definitely not close with an Otterbox case. A smaller case may allow you to close, but it if it does, it will be a very tight fit. I'll see if I have another use for this holster. If not, I'll return it, and if I do return it, I expect the shipping costs to be covered by Amazon.",2
1985,"We bought this as a replacement for another kids instrument set, which we really liked. While it looked similar, it certainly didn't sound like the old ones. We will be returning and trying again to get the ""original"" :(",2
1986,Nothing spectacular about this product. The color is more lighter than I expected. Feels likes a regular t-shirt.,2
1987,Water bottle doesn‚Äôt fit them. I sent them back,2
1988,Wasn't really happy with this the person on the other end said you hear more backround noise they they could hear me,2
1989,"I can't say much about the hose itself, but the connector hardware is of very thin construction and will not last long. If you will connect the hose only once, you are probably OK. But it you will connect and disconnect from time to time, the connectors (both ends), made of thin sheet metal instead of cast, will fail you in no time. Will not recommend. Will recommend Amazon to take it out of its ""Choice"" list - not a high quality product.",2
1990,Did not fix squeaky floor,2
1991,Yes if you drill into the entire add they are the small size that they say they are. However I was only searching in standard size bed pillows which every ad before it and after it we're the same even though they were more money. This was totally not what I was looking for and it's also my fault for not double-checking. Now I have four really nice new standard size pillow cases and these little tiny pillows...,2
1992,I like how the case looks I really do but it is already coming apart I have had it for 1 day and it is making my Face ID not work. The looks of the case can not get it more then 2 stars.,2
1993,"I thought the picture was great, until I noticed the banding issue getting worse. Then I realized 4K sometimes looks worse because of this. Then there is the audio. No matter what devise I plug into, there is an audible static whenever sound is being played. It reminds me of those old sound clips for AOL Instant Messenger. Will be returning this. Was a shame, I waited minths for this to TV to come out.",2
1994,I'm only on page 44 and continue to find inaccuracies. The calculation to find your BMR uses the wrong mathematical symbol and unit. Also the calculation for needed carbs per day is wrong. It should use body weight in kg -not pounds. I certainly should not be carb loading with 900 grams of carbs!,2
1995,Well I had ordered two of them when I them one would not work when took out of printer the chip tape had fell off and did not work.As far as other one works just fine for now hope it last.....,2
1996,"I bought two of them in April and both felt good when I tested at home, but one one of them is slowly deflating over 30min period üòì, just couldn't sleep over the weekend. However other one is good. Since it's 2mo I bought it I can't return it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Advice: test at home for long time, sit on it for a bit.",2
1997,Packaging was not good and one glass was broken when we opened it. My wife cut her hand on broken glass that was in another cup. Not like this brand used to be.,2
1998,"Pros: Good size, almost covers the top of our queen mattress Cons: Not as soft as it looks. Very heavy, but not because the pile of the fur is so lush, but because it's 2 pieces of fabric sewn together, and the backing is heavy, like faux leather. The fur is short, and has a rubber feel to it. My 12 year old daughter said it made her skin feel itchy.",2
1999,"these were too small but my biggest problem is how low rise they are, and have very little give in them",2
2000,"If you're into thick tshirts, then this is the perfect shirt for you. It's also cut small. The length is good, but not good enough for me to keep it.",3
2001,LOOK MORE BIG AT THE PICTURE,3
2002,Fits s little weird and pretty stiff but does it‚Äôs job,3
2003,"Ordered two identical rolls. One arrived with the vacuum bag having a large hole poked in the center - almost the size of the center hub hole. Since the roll arrives in a product box the hole either occurred before boxing at the manufacturer or I received a return. The seller responded promptly and asked for photos, which I provided. Then they asked if there was anything wrong with the product. Huh? I replied it has some issues (likely moisture related). Then they asked for details of issues. Huh? Well, I've had enough of providing them details of the damaged/defective product.",3
2004,product arrived bent on all corners. the bubble mailer alone will not ship it in perfect condition. :(,3
2005,"Comes apart easy Nice, one broke already",3
2006,"The presentation is great, but the flavor is ordinary, not impressed at all. I still would buy regular ones and decorate myself for less money.",3
2007,It was ok. I would not but again. It doesn't lock very well. So anyone can open it.,3
2008,"Not the best, but did help out a little for wind. They discolor fast and they are really big. I used electrical tape to keep it on.",3
2009,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and she loves it. The only problem is that the wings do not snap on very well, and very easily detach.",3
2010,Last me only couple of week,3
2011,"Can't complain for price, product is a light fragrance not too heavy, great for your travel bag, great thing about this brand is they have several different scents, affordable enough you try them all",3
2012,I was expecting more. These things are tiny,3
2013,Only problem is cover is so thin it tore fist night near the plug-in but it still works so far,3
2014,"This system is not as simple & straight-forward to program as one with fewer tech capabilities. The voice quality of the Caller ID announcement is poor & there are multiple steps to use Call Block and to access, then erase, Messages. However, the large capacity to store Blocked Calls is a major reason for the purchase.",3
2015,"Disappointed...description says 16 ounce. Shipping box and sticker on bottom of mug says 14 ounce. Only holds 14 ounce. I would have returned them, but being I got rid of my old ones in anticipation of the delivery today I am stuck. I wonder if there is a price difference? I would have rather had the 16 ounce. However, they are very nice mugs with a couple flaws. Overall, if you want nicely made 14 ounce mugs, these are perfect.",3
2016,Product is of lower quality,3
2017,The function is good but the plastic grade is not strong,3
2018,Very light weight... feels cheap,3
2019,Listed to fit 2019 Subaru Forester. It doesn't fit 2019.,3
2020,"This product is not as viewed in the picture, was assuming it would be gold but came in a silver color. Slightly disappointed but not worth returning due to the quality of price.",3
2021,Taste was not as good as expected. Pricey.,3
2022,The stand broke within two weeks of me having the case and I used the stand once.,3
2023,"Expected more out of the movie. Reviews indicated that this would be a cast of thousands, but ended up being maybe a couple of hundred people stranded on the beach. Over all ok, but expected more actors which history showed that over 100,000 stranded on the beach.",3
2024,"These are very nice. I bought two sets, and out of the two sets only one didn‚Äôt work... I like the design of the lights, and it projects a very cool looking star on the ground. I just wish they all worked.",3
2025,Headlights were nice and all but after installing the retainer clips the piece that the clip holds onto broke. Now I have a broken headlight that is zip tied to hold it in place. Hopefully warranty covers the damage.,3
2026,Too little for too much money. Barely noticed any change. You have to use this for the crepe erase to work.,3
2027,The top part of the cover does not stay on.,3
2028,"Great lite when plugged in, but light is much dimmer when used on battery mode.",3
2029,These are pretty but only provide minimal shaping.,3
2030,The 8 year old nephew said he wanted this for his birthday. I felt it was a bit much for a toy but he caught me on a good day. Come to find out it's a fragile collectible so the nephew lost all the small parts the moment he opened it. I guess it's adequate for collectors that want detail on such a small figurine.,3
2031,"Decent quality, but only came with 8 instead of 10!",3
2032,The color selection was not what I expected from the photo,3
2033,"it fill the hole, but i broke one install it. it""s made kind of thin!",3
2034,"My dog loves this toy, I haven't seen hear more thrill with any other toy, for the first three days, which is how long the squeaker lasted. She is not a heavy chewer, and in one of her ""victory walks"" after retrieving the ball, the squeaker was already gone. Apart from that it is my best investment",3
2035,Such little powder for a big bottle. Worst than lays potato ships,3
2036,I never usually ever right a negative review.... I purchased this item and rcvd it yesterday... I opened it today and as you can tell from the pictures.... it came with no cushion or anything to protect it during shipping and handling... as soon as I open the box... I noticed it was damaged... as you can see in my pics too... it came with a dent & it looked like the dent happend either before it was shipped or during the handling.... there is puncture through the box that damaged the shelf... I did contact Amazon right after I opened the box and saw the damage... For such a pretty pricey item... you will think that it will have foam or bubble packaging or something around it to protect it... Very disappointed...,3
2037,"This Christmas window sticker receive very small, not look like the picture.z",3
2038,I love the look but it is made cheaply and won't last if used daily.,3
2039,I love the sound of this system but you can't turn it off permanently. After I turn it off it will turn back on sometimes 20 minutes later and sometimes 2 hours later. It kind of made me fill like there was a video camera inside one of the speakers spying on me. Now I unplug it when I'm done using it. Why would someone want to turn something off just temporarily?,3
2040,"I want to love this but the zipper design is flawed. Maybe it's my particular unit but I can't use the bottom zipper at all. It feels as if a zipper is missing. Unless you are really crafty, which I'm not, this makes the pod inoperable after the zipper comes undone.",3
2041,"Ehh. I mean it's pretty. But for what I paid for I was expecting a little more durability. Extremely thin, no padding. It's currently in our front entrance, which gets moderate daily use and regular vacuuming for 3 months and already starting to fray.",3
2042,"Too much background for me. Very repetitive and just seems like a lot of filler. If you enjoy flying and have an interest in computers, you‚Äôll probably enjoy this book. The first book was ten times better than this one. I still like the series, though.",3
2043,"The story was fun, but instead of the length I expected, it was only 187 pages.. The remaining 42 pages were excerpts from other books!",3
2044,I like this planner a lot. However I just discovered it has a flaw in manufacturing. the hole punching is wrong from July -December. I expect pages from December will start to fall out soon.,3
2045,Cute little envelopes perfect for what I needed them for. The stickers do not stick though,3
2046,Product came broken and not the best quality. Great customer service though. They sent a fixed piece right away. Still not the best file cabinet you can buy.,3
2047,Giving it 3 stars because he‚Äôs missing a claw. Not sure if this toy was used or didn‚Äôt pass QA properly.,3
2048,It fits for a 2015 Nissan Altima. Easy to install. DOES NOT come with any screws which I didn‚Äôt like. It‚Äôs only the mount.,3
2049,Great salt! One of the bags was open though and salt spilled into the box. How do I contact customer support to get a replacement?,3
2050,I received the product yesterday and took my first dose. I woke up this morning and quickly noticed the clear polish on my nails had turned a deep pink. I will continue taking the vitamins but that was a weird reaction.,3
2051,"Wish I had done my homework to understand that I would need to buy additional fittings to make this work. Once properly fitted and connected, it worked fine.",3
2052,"Still can‚Äôt believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else comes close in comparison. I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my 4th one. Dog chewed up the first one, husband kneeled on the screen of the second one, and the third ones still working but there‚Äôs an elbow mark in the middle of the touch screen also courtesy of the hubby...bought this one as a back up and the screens great but the battery it came with holds a charge maybe for a couple days. My original (3rd one) keeps a charge for weeks at a time and I use my remote for everything.",3
2053,"The product installed easily and looks good. We have very good water pressure, perhaps a little too much for this showerhead. I find myself reducing the pressure quite a lot so the spray doesnt go everywhere. Not sure I would buy again. It is akin to the shower heads you might find in a locker room. I bought it for the efficiency.",3
2054,Cheaper than Pet Store,3
2055,"I like the print, but the product image is deceiving. I though the background was an off-white/tan color, but in reality it is a bright white.",3
2056,I don't think we have seen much difference. Maybe we aren't doing it right.,3
2057,"kinda rough, not comfortable. looked nicer in the pictures. returned",3
2058,This egg beater doesn't blend the eggs as well as I had hoped. The egg yolks don't get super incorporated even after a couple of minutes. Even when I use a narrow jar so that the egg yolks have no way to escape the beaters. I do like that the beaters are easy to separate from the handle and can go in the dishwasher. You can also remove one beater and just use one if desired.,3
2059,Help..... I ordered and paid for one and received 3. How do we handle this?? Don‚Äôt publish.... just answer,3
2060,"Short handle, scoop to narrow, scraper material too thin and easy to bend.",3
2061,These are ok. I‚Äôm not a fan of the elastic around the waistband and legs. Other than that they are great. If they used a softer material these would be perfect!,3
2062,Not a credible or tasteful twist at the end of the book,3
2063,"Great earbuds for the price, while they lasted. I bought these less than 7 months ago, and the left channel is all but dead. They sounded really good and I wish they had lasted longer.",3
2064,"They look like good quality but im disappointed. Description was misleading and i should have read the questions. I didnt know the height measurement was including the wheels. I need to replace my 29"" bag not including the wheels. Debating what to do.",3
2065,Read the dimensions!!! This vanity is clearly for kids. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 so I thought it would be perfect but In the mirror I can‚Äôt even see my forehead. I will be removing the mirror and mounting my own larger mirror on the wall instead. The desk size will work because I needed something to fit in a small space but I‚Äôll hurt myself trying to slouch down and do my makeup in that thing,3
2066,"its a great looking product, but when i turned on the sound, the baby is scared of the wagging tail :( shes only 2 years old. i kept it, hopefully she will grow out of fear soon.",3
2067,"Back is mesh, watch you couldn't see from the photos - unfortunately that means I had to return it because the last thing I need is to get little dots of tan all over me. Otherwise was nice, had to size up to a large like the other reviewers noted.",3
2068,"The first time I bought it the smell was barely noticeable, this time however it smells terrible. Not sure why the smell change if the formula didn't change but the smell makes it hard to use. I guess I would rather it smell bad than be sick though...",3
2069,I really can't give a review at this time because I have not used it yet. The electrical outlet did not come with it and nothing in the procure tells you what to buy.,3
2070,"It's an ok bin. I got it to use as a clothes hamper thinking it was more of a linen material, probably my mistake for not reading the description better but it's actually more like a plastic. Decided it would be better suited for my daughter's stuff animals. It's cute and serves a purpose and isn't all that expensive. Just not what I thought it would be when originally purchasing it.",3
2071,Great taste but the box was sent in a mailing envelope. So produce was smashed.,3
2072,Not all the colors of beads were included with my kit,3
2073,"I never received the item, it was said to arrive late for about 10 days, and yet not arrived. When it was showing expected receiving the next day, I thought just cancel and return it since it was so late. The refund processed without issues and received an email told me just keep it, but actually I never received the item.",3
2074,Lids will not stay latched.,3
2075,"The product itself is decent, but one of the 3 candle holders arrived in pieces. I informed the company. It's been more than a week, and they haven't responded, at all. To me, that is shady.",3
2076,"Kinda short. kinda thin, only printed on one side. Good bandannas for dogs, maybe not so much for people, unless you're looking for a thin face covering, then it would be 4 stars. Happy with camo pattern selection and style.",3
2077,"I love the idea, but the stitching on the ends of the toys come undone easily making these toys a choking hazard for my students.",3
2078,"Good coffee but taste weak. The 24 hour brewing process is a bit of a pain. If you leave the bags in the water past the brewing time the coffee taste bitter. All that said, I will probably buy this product again, now that I know what to expect.",3
2079,"I enjoyed it. pretty religious, and I'm someone who isn't religious in the least. A lot of passages about God. I skimmed them. Going in, I already knew that the author likes to write about her beliefs, and there's nothing wrong with that. so no complaints. I mention it because I don't mind it, but someone else may. I know how people can be.... *cough* At first I thought the build up took a while, but by the end, everything made sense. also...it was too long in my opinion. sections that were PAGES long that I just skipped, and skimmed because they added nothing to the story. if anything they made me forget what was going on.",3
2080,"Hit a bump while driving, and it falls off the vent. Phone holder needs to be reinserted into the vent after every use as it wiggled half off the vent.",3
2081,I did not know that I had to build it as a kit,3
2082,the leads were hard in my set of 12 never gave me the feel of them being soft like others said they were,3
2083,I not going to buy it again,3
2084,"I knew these were small, but wow! These are tiny. Gave them to my 8 year old to doodle in.",3
2085,The worst purchasing experience. You get what you pay for. Much worse than I was expecting!,3
2086,Nice color but very Small,3
2087,"Decent quality, but my thighs are a bit too big for them. The left sock seemed somehow smaller? I tried switching the socks to see if it was just my legs, but that definitely wasn't the case.",3
2088,There are no pockets for organization inside this bag. There are flat divided areas on the outside but not convenient. The material is good and has been durable thus far.,3
2089,"Sound is good, but one of the wall mounts was broke right out of the box.",3
2090,"Wow, you do NOT want to make a Gypsy angry. I'll never forget the hair-ripping....",3
2091,"This could be a 5 start great product if they just moved the point where they weld the USB / VGA wires together. The device works well. BUT, not with a laptop. If your laptop doesn't have two USB on the same side as the vga port, you will have issues. Every laptop I have the VGA port is on one side and only one USB on that same side. This means I have to use a USB on each side. This cable won't span that distance. I had to manually use a knife to cut off the plastic weld spot on the cable to allow me enough slack to plug in both USB. Once I got it hooked up though, it works flawlessly. If that weld were moved 6-8 inches, the problem is solved.",3
2092,"The description indicates it's a roll on, but what arrived is a 10 ml bottle of the essential oil. I was really looking for a roll on that i could send to school with my child. The bottle stopper is also not functioning well as it just pours out and you can't limit it to just a drop.",3
2093,Doesn‚Äôt seem to last like the original,3
2094,Great for wearing around the house. Will not be buying anymore. :(,3
2095,Fit was made incredibly snug by a short zipper. Should have expected a barrier with the value price.,3
2096,It‚Äôs a great bag great design however it should come in sizes. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4 275 it‚Äôs really tight.,3
2097,"This is about worth the price you pay for it. It looks fairly nice, but is not super sturdy. It was also initially difficult to put together because of how you have to drill in the nails -you drill them into little wells. I had to get two different screwdrivers. The directions recommend you use an electronic drill to get the nails set and a manual drill to tighten them, and that actually is required.",3
2098,This item is smaller than I thought it would be but it works great!,3
2099,Fits perfect but the front is too light weight compared to the back. It can flip easily. I have to hold it down at all times. Hoping to figure out a way to weigh it down so it‚Äôs safer.,3
2100,washes out very quickly,3
2101,A little disappointed with this sweat vest.. no significant help with sweating.,3
2102,Does not work as I thought it would. It really doesn't help much. It only last for like a hour.,3
2103,"Interesting from the very beginning. Loved the characters, they really brought the book to life. Would like to read more by this author.",3
2104,My set was missing a sign clip and has an extra stand clip.,3
2105,This is a nice headset but I had a hard time trying to switch the language on it to English,3
2106,Overall I liked the phone especially for the price. The durability is my main issue I dropped the phone once onto a wood floor from about 12 inches and the screen cracked after having it for about 2 weeks. Otherwise it seemed to be a decent phone. It had a few little quirks that took a little getting used to but otherwise I think it wood be a good phone if it was more durable.,3
2107,The functionality of this product works as expected. Used for student with ADHD. This timer should cost around $5. It gets 3 stars overall because it is priced too high.,3
2108,Good design. Like the setup minus the handles. They are a hard plastic handle not sure of the durability.,3
2109,"Does the job, but wish I had ordered the stand",3
2110,"This is my second NATO Style Watch band. I love them But this one was slightly thicker than the first, thus making it hard to install the pins. There were no pins included.",3
2111,I carry a 380 and I can not make it seat right for hiking.,3
2112,Way smaller than expected,3
2113,works okay. the canister is not very big and has to be emptied a lot,3
2114,The packaging of this product was terrible. Just the device with no instructions in a box with no bubble wrap. Device rolling around in a box 3x‚Äôs it‚Äôs size. No order slip.,3
2115,"Doesn‚Äôt look or feel synthetic. It comes with two wig caps. The scalp is plastic so I‚Äôd suggest using a concealer of your skin tone on the part. It sheds like a lot.Also, look up jay baby bump method on YouTube. It will save your like on the hump in the front.",3
2116,"Solid performer until the last quart of oil was being drawn out, then it started to spray oil out of the top.",3
2117,We‚Äôve had this for over a year now. My daughter and her friends love it BUT I don‚Äôt think it will last too many more years. The cedar is fading quickly. The table is very wobbly. If there are more than 2 small kids swinging at a time then the whole thing rocks back and forth even being staked in the ground. We will have to start replacing boards very soon to allow the kids to continue playing on it safely.,3
2118,This book just really wasn't for me. It was hard to hold my attention.,3
2119,Great delivery but it did have some grease marks around the bottom of the box. This is a great addition to my MOTU Funko set.,3
2120,"Bought this item not even three months ago and am already starting to have problems. The steal slates to support the mattress (as advertised NO BOX SPRING NEEDED) does in fact need that extra layer of support. I am currently using about 7 blankets underneath my mattress for support. However my bed does stay in place, there is storage underneath like I needed and all around is a good product. But if you do plan on buying this item make sure you have the extra support for your mattress!!!",3
2121,"So it worked very well when I first received. The wireless charging and the lightening charging port both worked great. Over time the lightening port start to fail. Now, the port it not really usable. When you pull the connector into the port, it's so loose that it may or may not charge your phone. The Qi wireless charging still works great.",3
2122,I can't wear these all day. Snug around the toes.,3
2123,"As a hard shell jacket, it‚Äôs pretty good. I ordered the extra large for a skiing trip. It comes small so order a size bigger then normal. I can not use the fleece liner because it is too small. The hard shell is not water proof. I live in the Pacific Northwest and this is not enough to keep you dry. I really like the look of this jacket too.",3
2124,Need better packaging. Rose just wiggles around in the box. Bouncing and damaging.,3
2125,"Love the lights, however, if you leave them in the on position for more than a few days in order to use the remote, the batteries drain quickly whether the candles are actually lit up or not.",3
2126,This product is ok but I am not impressed with the coverage.,3
2127,"I love the book series and I thought the movie was ok. If you expect the movie to be like the actual book though, you‚Äôre going to be disappointed. Standard action thriller stuff, nothing spectacular but watchable. Not wild about the casting choice for Mitch. Could do without the female agent, didn‚Äôt like her role nor the casting choice. I hope the sequel is better.",3
2128,I had bought two separate pairs for two dodges that I own and both pairs went out withing the year best to get warranty on them but they had good light to them.,3
2129,Complex characters and the plot is a riddle. Entertaining even if not the usual good guys win.,3
2130,My daughter collects these. The first one I ordered came with a broken arm. I returned it for a second one. It came with green (dress) paint up the arm.,3
2131,"Very cute top, looks well made it just had too much cleavage for me. Returned for refund without any issues.",3
2132,"I'm in a Shakespeare course and this adaptation sticks pretty close to the text. It was helpful to watch what I was having trouble envisioning while reading. The acting is marvelous, but the production quality is disappointing. It is SO incredibly dark. Literally, not enough light. I watched this on a good television, my computer, an ipad, and in a dark room. It was so difficult to see the expressions due to the poor lighting. Also, the part of the story that takes place in a storm is ridiculous. The fake wind is so loud, you can barely hear the actors lines. That with the bad lighting, it felt a bit pointless. The fake snow didn't help. Too bad because the acting, of what I could see and hear, was brilliant.",3
2133,"These fit snugly, but they're long, so there's always a small bunching around my toes or arch. Being as I have size 10 women's feet, I found this to be surprising. I still wear them, but I don't plan on buying more. They feel good to wear because I like that they're tighter, but I don't know if they actually help with the Planter Fasciitis.",3
2134,Product was ok. Not as sticky as I wanted!,3
2135,I think the quality is first rate. The only drawback is the roll over top hem. It leaves a big dent where it rests on my calf. The other 20/30 support hose I bought has a different top band . It is a different weave and is more like a band and leaves almost no indentation on my calf.,3
2136,"Good, but not his best. Well-researched but basically revolves around the growth of one town in Ohio. Would have liked broader view",3
2137,"Not a bad case, but the clip on the carrying loop broke within a couple days. The magnets on the case are pretty weak as well. Overall, it's just okay.",3
2138,"Received this a few weeks ago and just last week got around to finish installing my cameras. All but one cable worked correctly, it would show an extremely dark image and wiggling the connection brought back color but only temporarily. Switched it for another cable and no problem!",3
2139,They‚Äôre a nice marker but they‚Äôre not your typical brush pen! The brush marker isn‚Äôt at all flexible and it‚Äôs hard to get the calligraphy look with them!,3
2140,"3.5 STARS ,...

PURCHASED,... should have only RenteD !!!",3
2141,They're fine however two were broken on arrival.,3
2142,Product is advertised as neoprene it is not. It's a canvas type material. It still looks as pictured and so far seems like its durable. Only time will tell however advertising as neoprene when it is not is a huge downfall. I was going to be purchasing 5 others for our other truck and for Christmas gifts this year but will not be simply because of the false advertising.,3
2143,"Didn't think they were in my package along with the book I ordered because they were tucked into a TINY black plastic bag that got caught in the corner of the mailing envelope. The last time I ordered these Tesla tire caps, they came in a box. Cheap way to send and cheap way to cause me to loose them or toss them out with the mailing envelope. Package them better so they don't escape.",3
2144,"Very cute, but the size was way too small",3
2145,Haven‚Äôt seen any diff as such but smells and feels good,3
2146,"The lights are very nice and very easy to put in. I really like that there is a shut off button for on-off underneath the light itself. The reason for 3 stars is I don't find the lights to be that bright. The past reviews had people saying how bright they are, but the 12 lights I purchased really don't put off that much light.",3
2147,"Available much cheaper elsewhere, I discovered. Shop around, off Amazon.",3
2148,"This is not a good kettle if you live with other people who might be asleep when you are using the kettle. I contacted the manufacturer and there is no way to turn off the sound feature. Edited from one to three stars because they gave me the kettle for free which was nice, but there was a ton of back and forth with customer service saying they'd give me a new kettle without a beeping sound, but they didn't in the end because of my address (which they could've looked at beforehand saving us all a lot of time). I know customer service is tough and I like free stuff. It was a mixed bag overall though most companies these days wouldn't do anything to try to make good and they did so that counts for something.",3
2149,"It's light, small, easy to carry around! But it doesn't charge sometimes...",3
2150,"It lets my baby sleep amazingly, I have used it since he was 3 weeks old and he is now 2 months old and sleeping for 6 hours in a row and sometimes more, the only issue I have is it bubbles up by his face where the zipper is at and sometimes covers his face and it really freaks me out because that is a HUGE suffocation hazard. Wish this could get fixed.",3
2151,"Like but don't love...it works pretty good, but not as well as I was hoping for.",3
2152,a little static sometimes might be problems elsewhere,3
2153,"I have some wool skiing socks that are just as compression-y as these, and they fit better.",3
2154,"The Pillow Case was cute but there was only one, I just thought I was getting two so was disappointed.",3
2155,The stars are only noticeable under a microscope. Just use standard glitter. I used standard glitter on the top and stars on the side of my cake... can you see a difference?,3
2156,"Very drop ended up with a crack in the screen protector, which is probably why 1 of the screens came already snapped in half. However, easy to install like most screen protectors.",3
2157,Big and uncomfortable for my 4 year old. Update: bumped up rating for great customer support.,3
2158,"Solid product, helped my back",3
2159,"The pencil crayon tip broke in half soon after the first use and didn‚Äôt last very long. The gel is difficult to apply, so that it isn‚Äôt too thick on the brows. I prefer the double tip pencil from Wunderbrow.",3
2160,These bowls are wonderful. And the only reason I didn't give them a 5 is because I ordered RED bowls and received ORANGE bowls.,3
2161,"My twin grand babies will not be here until March. So we have not used them yet. The only thing so far that I was let down by was the set for the girl showed a cute bow, when I got it, it was just the cap. You should not show the boy in the picture.",3
2162,These smell so good but don't seem to do much as far as cleaning fur. Good for paws and eyes.,3
2163,"This is a beautiful rug. exactly what I was looking for. When I received it, I was very impressed with the color. However, it is very thin. My dinning room table sets on it so I don't think it will get much wear. I hope it will hold up over time.",3
2164,"Very strong cheap pleather smell that took a few days to air out. One of the straps clips onto the zipper, so be careful of the zipper slowly coming undone as you walk.",3
2165,This product was ‚Äúok‚Äù for an spf moisturizer. It had an oily feel and the fragrence was a little strong for me.,3
2166,I have a note 5 and have to leave it sideways,3
2167,"These do run large than expected. I wear a size 6 ordered 5-6 and they are way to big, I have to wear socks to keep them on . Plus I thought they would be thicker inside but after wearing them for a few days they seemed to break down . I will try to find a better pair",3
2168,"The only issue I have with this item, and one of which you should be aware, is that the holes punched in the basket are made toward the top. This results in very sharp edges around the holes inside the basket instead of on the bottom where they should be, As such, if you brush along the bottom of the basket, as you normally would, it will shred your brushes quickly. If you have cheap brushes that wouldn't really be much of a problem but I wouldn't suggest using this with your more expensive ones. I wound a coil of aluminum wire and laid it inside to protect my brushes from the bottom of the basket.",3
2169,Minimal protection that is just barely better than no case at all. It does allow the beauty of the phone to show through though. If you're very careful this one will work. Otherwise... keep looking.,3
2170,"Unfortunately, the it is not the right color. I'm trying to see if it can be darkened so that I can use it and not through money down the drain.",3
2171,"Like others, I would agree with most comments. I did find the gameplay to be decent and fun enough in portable mode. It was generally a good first effort in a MX game. However, as stated, I have no idea what is going on with the graphics. The game in hand held mode is a blurry mess. I feel like I'm looking through the bottom of a Coke bottle. Especially the rider. In docked mode the game looks a little better. I was really looking forward to this one and it is close because the gameplay is pretty good, but man the graphics for the rider need some work.",3
2172,A very light broom that works well,3
2173,The pockets on this dress are quite low and they push out making your hips look wider which I do not need. It's also quite long and runs a little big. Not flattering. It was returned.,3
2174,The quality is not that great but if worn with the right accessories and shoes you can make it look much better. The high waist is a bit baggy and looked as if it was sagging so you also have a very specific body type to pull this outfit off. I have returned mine.,3
2175,Enjoyable but at times confusing and difficult to follow.,3
2176,"Just received in mail, I think I received a used one as it had writing in the first 3 pages. And someone else's name... Otherwise seems like pretty good quality",3
2177,"quits making ice before basket is half full, and is very noisy",3
2178,Way smaller than I thought it would be - about 1/5 the size of typical Kan Jam,3
2179,Doesn't stay put. Annoying.,3
2180,"The plug was not as flat as I had hoped, so I was unable to use this for the outlet it was intended for (did not fit behind furniture). Also, note the orientation of the plug. It is angled to one side in a fixed position and does not swivel, so I had difficulty using this in other locations due to the awkward angle. I wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to return this so it‚Äôs sitting in a box currently until I figure out what to do with it.",3
2181,"The brushes are already starting to fray after only a few uses, I‚Äôve even had to trim some stragglers from the sides with scissors!! But in the beginning they are nice and small and pointy for precision work, just be prepared that they won‚Äôt last forever",3
2182,Very sticky and is messy! Make sure you wipe the lid and top really good or you will struggle to get it open the next time you use it!,3
2183,Two of my cups arrived with cracks in them and one straw is broken. Unacceptable.,3
2184,"These bags are so easy, I love them! My ONLY problem is the measurements are way off! I took one bag and marked it correctly as a reference. If it wasn't for that they would be a 5 star. I've gone through almost 35 now and not one has leaked.",3
2185,It started out slow. It did get better half way.,3

2187,tomatoes still cracked too bad they seemed a good idea they are easy to use,3
2188,"Nice but not as ""Thick"" as I really needed. Its a nice quality sock, comfortable.",3
2189,"Definitely brightened my deck but didn‚Äôt do much for removing the algae stains on the wood. Yes, I followed the instructions meticulously.",3
2190,More a condom color like 'clear' rather than actually clear.,3
2191,Just annoying. Not happy. Not worth buying.,3
2192,Great product but be aware of return policy.,3
2193,"I would like to give this product a 4.5 but it bends when I put my weight on it, especially during a pull up. Is that normal? I only weigh 175 lbs.",3
2194,it‚Äôs a love hate... I don‚Äôt have a high nasal bridge so its hard to find a mask that doesn‚Äôt push down on my nose too much and still blocks out light. It‚Äôs great if you don‚Äôt have the same issues as me. Other than that just watch out for color transfer on your pillow or sheets.,3
2195,No joke as I was getting ready to right a GOOD review for this figit toy. IT BROKE. Didnt even last 10 minutes. I am so disappointed as I was hoping this tou could help my 4 year old with his trichotillomania. Edit. The seller issues a refund quickly so I will increase my rating to 3 stars,3
2196,Very nice looking guitar. Too bad the company does not know how to protect their product. Don‚Äôt bother trying to receive one that is not damaged. We returned 2 because of damages in shipping and the the 3rd one was damaged also. Gave up. They ship it in the soft thin case with one sheet of brown paper in a cardboard box. No padding at all.,3
2197,Good product. does the job.,3
2198,Smells earthy. Watery.,3
2199,"While I love how soft the fabric is, and the waistband tie that solves the terrible gap in the back, the size M are a bit of a challenge to get over my hips. I do typically wear a size 10 or 12. Also I'm 5'5"" and not sure how tall the model is for these to hid mid knee - for me these hit me in the most unflattering place below my knees which made my calves look HUGE. They also have a bit lower rise than I'd like. I ordered the shorts instead in size L which say a 12"" inseam (unrolled), which hopefully will have a bit higher rise, be easier to get over my hips, and back gap solved with the waist tie, and hit right at mid knee.",3
2200,Not bad but the battery does not last long after running 20min non stop. I would not spend my money on this product again. A lot more options out there on Amazon. Maybe I received a bad unit but would not buy again,3
2201,"Works well under water. The ear buds I received has one that doesn't work, but I already programmed the ipod and don't want to return the entire thing. Overall a great purchase for lap swimming.",3
2202,One worked great. The other one won‚Äôt keep the phone standing up. It lays back flat. Same phone. Love the one that works but wouldn‚Äôt recommend bc they all don‚Äôt work.,3
2203,"The sprinkler spout snaps on the bottle, but leaks.",3
2204,"Hash brown main entree wasn't great, everything else was amazing. What else can you expect for an MRE?",3
2205,Would not connect to my phone.,3
2206,I'm really disappointed that Garden of Life SOLD OUT to NESTLE!!! Now I have to find a replacement for this supplement.,3
2207,"So far I have tried it on 4 moles and they are still there. I don‚Äôt think I zapped it long enough to see better results. They do sting and it‚Äôs hard to know how long the mike needs to be zapped. Just in I have been testing on my arms to understand how long I need to zap for. I think this product works, just not sure how to use it effectively.",3
2208,Works good but wears up fast.,3
2209,"Make sure you have two pairs of pliers, those balls are wedged on TIGHT. They work just fine though.",3
2210,Love the concept. Whoever packaged and delivered this messed up. One of the wine glasses were broken in half. I even found a dead moth in the thermal pocket! How long has that been in there for??? Other than that it‚Äôs cool but I‚Äôm pretty sad that I didn‚Äôt get it 100% how it was promised.,3
2211,"Pretty color, but it felt a little gritty.",3
2212,"seems okay, weaker than i thought it be be and too tight",3
2213,"This is the worst designed bucket ever. Didn't anyone try to pick this up with water in it or try to fill or empty it before putting it on the market? The handle placement is ridiculous. DO NOT attempt to pick this up by the handle, it tips and you will have water everywhere. The only reason I'm even giving it 3 stars is because it does spin and the mop does work but I would not buy again. I have never given a bad review on any product but this thing is ridiculous.",3
2214,I love the curls but the hair does shed a little; it has been a month; curls still looks good; I use mousse or leave in conditioner to keep curls looking shiny; hair does tangle,3
2215,"Product was fine, but it took WEEKS for delivery. If I'd known it was made in and shipped from China, I wouldn't have ordered this one.",3
2216,Everyone got a good laugh,3
2217,"While it‚Äôs generally not a bad product, the description details states that it‚Äôs unscented. The truth is that this deodorant does have scent. Not too strong but enough to conflict with my perfume.",3
2218,"O bought this as a gift. This book is well written and illustrated but the new baby is a ""boy"". No where in the description of the product does it indicate that. I won't be able to give this if the new sibling is a girl.",3
2219,"Nice dyer, But it is not quiet, No way could I speak with my customers when this is on high",3
2220,Arrived as advertised.,3
2221,"I'm torn. This is Quite Good Ginger Ale. The only problem is that I think it destroyed by coffee canister and my bag of noodles. I keep meaning to compare its ingredients to those of Canada Dry. My Polish grandfather used to swear by ginger ale when someone was sick. He said it restored... I forget what it restored, but I'm thinking the ingredients were the restoring factor. Back in the days of my Polish Grandfather, the only commercial Ginger Ale, that I know of, was Canada Dry.",3
2222,"Great idea! My nose is always cold and I can't fall asleep when it is cold, but for some reason this isn't keeping my nose warm.",3
2223,Corners broke from coming in and out of pocket within the first week,3
2224,"It‚Äôs a bit expensive and doesn‚Äôt lay right, it sticks to everything.",3
2225,Half seem to be dried out...I might have to return.,3
2226,It was ok. Interesting but a little predictable. I probably would have given it 4 stars but the fact that the lawyer was the only person speaking with an accent (and a questionable one at that) was driving me nuts. It would have been better for the cast to either commit to accents or all go without.,3
2227,These loosened up quickly.,3
2228,I would have given this watch 5 stars but mine did not come with a link removal tool as advertised. The seller referred me to Amazon to resolve and of course they were not able to provide. Amazon did issue a partial credit but I've still not worn the watch until I can get to a watch store and pay to have the links removed.,3
2229,This fan was checked out before the installer left. Later that day I turned it on and the globe was wobbling a lot. He was able to return the next day and discovered that the screws fastening the globe were loose already. He replaced them with some bigger screws he had with him. That was two weeks ago and the fan is still fine. It is very attractive and quiet.,3
2230,"I had this case for under a month and the case started to crack and brake apart. I'm very gentle with my laptop especially paying over $1000 for it. The case was not that durability, I ended up throwing it away & purchased a new one from a different company and its much better, money wasted with this product :(",3
2231,"The shirt came and smells really bad. Like glue or plastic. Fits smaller than expected. Hopefully, washing the shirt will help the smell.",3

2233,"A little thinker than I wanted, but does protect the rear camera well. Also has side protection, but does not protect the screen when put face down. I personally don't like the 'sticky' feel of the TPU material and will be returning.",3
2234,"I really liked the tint this left behind, and it lasted for about 3-5 days for me, but when your try to take it off it rips a lot of your eyebrow hair out!",3
2235,"I love the glass design and the shape is comfortable in one hand. My first purchase of this kettle lasted for two years of daily use. The hinge on the lid is fragile, and since the lid doesn't flip entirely back - it gets strained and broke within the year. Everything else worked fine until the auto shut-off stopped working after two years. For safety, I bought a new one which has now stopped working entirely after 17 months. I still love the design, but for $58 I expected it to last longer.",3

2242,"Purchased these on April 6, 2018 and one just burned out. Today is May 9, 2019. They lasted just a little over a year and now I need replacements. When I installed them, I did not touch the bulb, and actually wore gloves. As others have mentioned in reviews, I was expecting a longer lifespan. I will probably try a differential brand this time. They were OK for the price point.",3
2243,I did not like the rather confusing instructions. I did manage to apply the screen without too many problems. I am very unhappy with the continuing need to clean fingerprints from the screen. Very difficult to clean the screen. Would not buy this product again.,3
2244,This product was small and very just thrown together the armholes where placed lower then they should have been.,3
2245,These bags tend to be wider than longer. Keep that in mind when you are thinking of buying them.,3

2251,"It‚Äôs a nice looking piece of furniture when assembled, but assembly was difficult. Some of the letter markings were incorrectly marked so I had to try and figure out on my own The screws they supplied to attach the floor and side panels all cracked. I had to go out and purchase corner brackets to make sure they stayed together. Also the glass panel doors are out of line and don‚Äôt match evenly. This alignment prevents one of the doors from staying closed as the magnet to keep the door closed is out of line. Still haven‚Äôt figured out to align them.",3
2252,Just too big to serve the purpose for needing the 90 degree turn.,3
2253,"I had gotten these for a family member who is getting up in years and is at risk of falls. His feet are too big in size (not length) and they would not fit. Looking more into the option on this type of sock he would have been better to get bariatric socks and maybe the seller can put something down like if you have swollen legs, edema in the legs etc, to look at the bariatric size.",3
2254,This was the second time I had bought this product . First was for myself second was a gift . Found the quality of the cards inferior to a good deck of playing cards (they are very thin) . The products add ons are great for scoring and trump ! Will not purchase again,3
2255,"It works okay but (my fault) I was disappointed with the size of the product I received. With the amount of 'money I paid I thought it would be bigger. Again, it was my fault for not reading about the size of the products. They are small.",3
2256,"The overall product was a fair purchase. It was higher priced than worth it and when compared to other leather purchases, I was more pleased with the ones not from amazon. In reality, it was a 12‚Äù by 12‚Äù leather square that really couldn‚Äôt do much except give me an idea of what I wanted to do if I had more. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend for new leather purchasers unless you literally want that specific size. All in all, it just wasn‚Äôt worth it for me.",3

2258,"I thought it was much bigger, it's look like a new born baby ear ring.",3
2259,"This product is cheap because it is made cheaply. You can feel it. While the actual mouse pad area itself feels really nice, the edges are sharp and scratchy. If I made this mousepad, I probably would smooth the edges. Yeah, it‚Äôs good on a budget, but if you‚Äôre looking for quality, go for a more expensive one with rounded edges.",3
2260,"Just like everyone else, I bought these so I could have my phone right next to my face while going to sleep, so it's not like I was yanking my phone around with these cords. But yes, they all crapped out on me in 6 months. The connection was so poor my phone kept warning me something about 'insufficient charging'.",3
2261,"Much darker than I expected, beautiful, but flowers are so big, I can't stand far enough away in my bathroom to get the full effect. Just not what I was trying for, so I reordered another style. Smaller sunflowers. But quality is great, and for some I am sure perfect.",3
2262,This run soooooo big. And they are very long.,3
2263,It would be better if they included the meaning of the words. It would be more educational,3
2264,Much smaller than what I expected. The quality was not that great the paper in the lower end of the cup was ruined after first wash with the kids.,3
2265,the magnets are very weak on some of the letters so it makes it hard for my kids to use them,3
2266,"Fit loose. And didn't come with nipple pasties. If your boobs aren't at least a D, it's not for you.",3
2267,I found this story very slow and quit reading after awhile. The premise was good just too slow moving. Maybe at some point I might go back to it.,3
2268,Size and fit are great...some residue seems to be on the screens and it can interfere when using the stylus. I used Windex to clean the screen and over time the stylus started to glide smoothly.,3
2269,"Can‚Äôt get ice all the way around the bowl. Only on the bottom, so it didn‚Äôt keep my food as cold as I would have liked.",3
2270,The umbrella itself is great but buyer beware they send you a random umbrella and not the design you pick. It's a good thing my daughter likes all the Disney princesses or I would have had an upset 3 year old. I picked a design that showed 4 different princesses on it and received one that had only snow white and the 7 dwarfs on it. When I went to the site I read the fine print that they pick the umbrellas at random so no need to return.,3
2271,"Was very disappointed to see there is a no integration with Ring Alarm. The only connection is they share the same app. There is no way to stop the cameras from recording when you are home (or the alarm is off). Even Canary cameras turn off (via geofencing) when you are home. The video quality and camera size are great, but these cameras need software updates to bring Ring Alarm integration.",3

2280,"Our family does a game night most weeks and I got this thinking it would be fun to play. And it was. We played it 3 times (2 adults and 2 kids, 11 and 10) before we figured out how to win every time. Even the ""more challenging"" level is just more flooding, which, once solved, isn't much of a challenge. I was hoping for re-playability, but we've taken this one out of the rotation. Fun and interesting the first couple of times through, though.",3
2281,If the speaker would of been a little louder this would be amazing,3
2282,Quality gloves for 30F and above. Negative 30F is just a poor joke.,3
2283,Has a great range for taking photos but the quality of the photos is not as good as other lenses.,3
2284,"I have three of these linked together. As many of the other reviews said, the legs are weak and prone to breakage even with careful use. It is best to provide some other means of support and not use the legs. Also the gaskets at the fittings do not seal well. I used RTV silicone sealant when assembling the water fittings to stop the leakage. These units are doing a good job heating my pool.",3
2285,Good value considering the price. The grommet for the handle came off within 2 weeks but not a big deal for me. Overall I'm happy with it. Design and color is great.,3
2286,My daughter absolutely loves this outfit but one of the arm bands came ripped and one of the boot/socks came with something yellow on it. Not happy about it but not at all worth the effort of mailing it back.,3
2287,"The earring are cute, but very cheap",3
2288,Quality is just okay. Magnet on the back is strong and it's nice its detachable but the case around the phone isn't very protective and very flimsy. You get what you pay for.,3
2289,"The show is great, and the package and discs were in great condition. My only complaint is that instead of getting DvD 2 for the first half, I got a second DvD 1.",3
2290,Sound quality is just okay. It is convenient going wireless.,3

2292,"The Specs say 1000 lumens max. I compared this against a relatively new LED flashlight from a different producer. That other flashlight was rated 300 lumens and it seemed to produce more light output than this flashlight when operating with a freshly charged battery and at the high power setting. I'm not saying that this is a Bad flashlight - I got it on a lightning deal for a pretty good price, but I really don't think the 1,000 lumen rating is realistic. I put it closer to 200 or so based on a comparison with a light rated at 300, and a few LED Mag Lite Replacements that are rated at a bit over 200. To measure light output accurately requires expensive equipment that few people have access to - so this is just doing things by eye - but I don't think my eyesight is that bad..... I do like the idea of the lithium ion rechargeable battery - but I don't think I would purchase another one of these....",3
2293,It was a great kit to put together but one gear is warped and i am finding myself ripping my hair out sanding and adjusting it to try to get it to tick more than a few seconds at a time.,3
2294,"The iron works good, but its very small, almost delicate. The insulation parts on the tip were plastic not ceramic. Came with the plug that's a bonus. But it took quite a bit longer then most things on amazon to ship. I use it for soldering race drones, i ordered the smaller tip, and its actually to small for all but my micro drones. Had to order another tip. Gets hot pretty quick. Apparently this is a firmware upgrade you can do to make it better, but i didn't have to use it.",3
2295,"Super cute and would be effective for the average chewer. My dog had the east of in less than a minute. I liked that when the limbs were removed, the stuffing wasn't exposed.",3
2296,I think I got a size too big and their are weird wrinkling at the thigh area. I got them bigger to be appropriate for casual work or church social occasions without fitting too tight. The color was nice and the pair I have are soft. I will try washing them in hot water to see if they shrink a little.,3
2297,They were really skinny and scrawny. They arrived alive and in good condition!!!,3
2298,"very cute style and design, but tarnished after 1 wear!",3
2299,"Easy to install, but very thin",3
2300,asian size is too small,3
2301,Does the job and appears to be sturdy. Most of the fittings leak which means you are going to get more wet than you planned but so far it is the best brush I have found that has a long adjustable length,3
2302,I loved this design. I really wanted this to look like the photo they took. The gradient is really patchy. More of a yellow fading to dirty. Oh well,3
2303,This is not something I would put up against any doorbell with 1080p. The annoying part about this doorbell is the strange fisheye image it displays. Not sure how anyone would find the fisheye effect acceptable. I had a Nest and it blows the image quality of this away.,3
2304,Like the privacy screen but it cracks easily.,3
2305,"They don't spin easily. They were for my daughter to use at school, since most fidget toys aren't allowed. She is allowed the rings. They cannot be spun with one hand so she can work and fidget at the same time. You have to hold the ring portion very firmly, then spin with the other hand. It really defeats the purpose of what we bought them for.",3
2306,The small cover didn‚Äôt seem to work very well. I don‚Äôt feel that they do Avery good job from keeping the avocado from turning brown,3
2307,"It‚Äôs ok, buttons are kind of confusing and after 4 months the power button is stuck and we can no longer turn it on or off. Sorta disappointed in this purchase.",3
2308,Foam on wrist exerciser cracked and came apart within a couple of weeks,3
2309,"This cooler looks really nice & sturdy, but the description is identical for all sizes including the listed size. I bought the 16 can and the 30 can and the sizes of both are not as listed. So you'll have to buy it to see if you get what you need. I returned both as the 16 can was just 2 small & the 30 can is way to big.",3
2310,Love the variety of colors,3
2311,I couldn't finish this movie. It reminded me of some of those science fiction movies where the bad guy keeps getting beat up and you think he's dead but he gets up again. This had way to much violence and over did the beating of Jesus. I'm sure the Romans were cruel but this was just over the top.,3
2312,"I am very upset and disappointed, a month ago I bought this axial and the second time I went to use it, the control stopped working, the car did not roll or move the direction to any side, I took it to check with a technician and made several tests connecting different controls to the car and it worked perfect but when we put back the control that brought the car did not work, very annoying since in theory this is one of the best cars and brands that are in the market",3
2313,"I'm giving this review 3-stars because it is a very well made bathing suit, very thick and good material but I ordered an xl and it was too small to even try on, I am a 40D bust and am 5 foot 3 inches usually fitting into a size 14 but this would fit someone more like a size 10, I am going to keep searching for one that will fit!",3
2314,Wish was larger pretty small,3
2315,Has torn but i fix it with duck tape and had put another couch cover of material on top so it would not get cut and my couch stay clean,3
2316,The idea is exactly what I was looking for but it came without some hardware and it is kind of flimsy. If you only need one of these bad boys for a bit its a good choice but I do not think it would last.,3
2317,Great product. Good look. JUST a little tough to remove.,3
2318,Looks and fits fine BUT the yarn is itchy.. should have a lining of some sort or softer yarn.,3
2319,This has elastic at both ends of it... which I didn‚Äôt like for my taste so I returned it I got a medium. I‚Äôm usually a small in everything and I‚Äôm a 32DD chest and it was a little big so that‚Äôs my mistake. Size down for a fitted look,3
2320,"Please note that it‚Äôs pretty small, so it‚Äôll take a few trips to grind enough for a good session. Also the top is kinda tricky because you have to screw it on each time to grind.",3
2321,"Due to the size of the computer part of the bracelet, it is a bit stiff on my wrist. Maybe my wrist is small. If that part could be even just 1/4 inch smaller, I think it would be much better as far as comfort. You can't read it outside. You attach it by pushing two round metal buttons into holes on the opposite end. It isn't the easiest thing to put on. It did fall off once, maybe I didn't push hard enough. I do like that it vibrates when I get a text message and incoming call, but my phone must be fairly close. But for the price I think it is worth it.",3
2322,while the chipper is well made and a work horse trying to get new or spare chipper knives ..is next to impossible called order 2 sets of knives they sent the wrong ones ..e mail them they said they would get back in 48 hrs that was 4 days ago going to email again so I will keep sharping the one it came with till I guess I will make my own or use troybuilt knives mill the holes my self a lot of work ..good luck,3
2323,Ring was not what I expected. Looked much shinier and prettier online.,3

2325,"This is a beautiful set. Fits well once on, although it was hard to get the skirt on because there is no zipper. You have to shimmy it up and down slowly at your hips to get it on and off. If you have junk in the trunk, you wont get it on without popping the seam. The shirt is a polyester fabric, so Im not so fond of that... I'll probably end up getting another shirt. The colors on the skirt are gorgeous. I brought an XL.",3
2326,they were faded more then pictured wish they came in different colors,3
2327,"I'm rather meh about the selection, mostly dark stones were sent, not the bright colorful ones seen in the listing. Some will work for what I need, some won't.",3
2328,I like this case a lot but it broke on me 3 times lol it's not very durable but it's cute! the bumper and clear part will snap apart,3
2329,"I purchased the 33"" and 36"" crate for the bedroom and one for the family area. I purposely purchased the 2 door for both so I can have options to position in either room although when using the puppy divider it clips on the side door so this door is not functional until the divider is not longer needed. Also, the divider clips well to one side but is loose on the other side and it is not a tight fit for safety. I did call Midwest support and they were very nice. They did confirm that with a 2 door the divider does not work. They requested pictures of the clasping issue with the divider on one side. Not sure there is anything to be done and my little girl is coming home in 2 days so I will just deal with it. It is a sturdy crate and has little rubber rollers on the bottom to help moving but take care moving over hardwood floors as it did touch it somehow without lifting and just rolling. Had to give 3 stars since the divider does not work with the 2 door option. This was very important for my needs.",3
2330,Color is pinkish. Not very tan at all.,3
2331,the pants fit perfect but the top was somewhat large. but really cute surprisingly,3
2332,ear holes are smaller so i can hurt after long use.,3
2333,"Easy and painless to use, but just assume you're going to have to go through the routine more than once, and for longer than the instructions tell you, to get any results.",3
2334,"Its a nice small string with beautiful lights, but I misread I assumed it was battery operated and its not, we are having some power issues weather related and I thought it would be nice for extra lighting, its electric plus its has to be close to an outlet. not very useful.",3
2335,"Had to use washers even though the bolts were stock like beveled in appearance. 3 pulled through the skid, and there isn't any rust issues. I called daystar because i spent the money so i wouldn't have to use washers. They told me to use washers.",3
2336,"These are good while they last. Unfortunately, they keep getting holes in them and have to be replaced more often than my other slam balls.",3
2337,Great product. Does wear out fast if walker is used outdoors. Remember to check gliders often,3
2338,Came with scratches and scuffs all over it. Very disappointed.,3
2339,Not yet used but appears to be of good quality and arrived on time.Guages not marked in PSI.Need to make X reference chart to use.,3
2340,This case was very good for my son phone he loved it,3
2341,"This was pretty cool. My glue was paste and impossible to get out of the bottle. I want this for crafts, did test on my skin, but since the glue was so thick, I couldn't get a clear tattoo. This is still perfect for crafting, as I intend to use it. Comes with a variety of stencils, nice glitter colors ,and 2 brushes. It is a fantastic kit....just ruined by the glue quality in my package.",3
2342,Bought for work. Good so far.,3
2343,"Bought this in an attempt to help with pumping. I heard so many good things, but I didn't find it as amazing as everyone else. Sure, it does its job, but after about 1oz of milk is expressed, nothing else comes out after so I still need to pump.",3
2344,"It does not fit 2018 Toyota Camry without fabricating the factory housing. The factory housing is very fragile and not easy to fabricate. If your not careful, you'll end up replacing the housing too. I was able to get mine to work, but not happy with the outcome. I would keep the factory filter if I had a chance to it over again. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I feel K&N generally makes a good product ... maybe they should just stick to engine air filters.",3
2345,"My girls love them, but the ball that lights up busted as soon as I removed from the package.",3
2346,I chose 3 stars because the book has a sad ending. I was disappointed in it. I don‚Äôt always require a happy ending but I only gave it 3 stars. I wouldn‚Äôt read it again.,3
2347,"I really dug how well these were working, but after a few months one of the pads came off. It'd be nice if the company sold replacement pads, but alas. I still keep this around to use as a lens duster, so it's not a complete loss.",3
2348,"I feel like this product has been really great with a lot of gel products I've been. Although I do feel that what outlet I use for this machine makes a difference. I don't think the machine itself is regulating the wattage at all. there have been occasions where using one product in my house I've burnt someone, then using the same product and same machine and same time in my work space of not burn someone. I am going to consider buying some type of accessory to maybe control the amount electrical wattage that comes into the machine. And if that doesn't do the trick I really don't know what I'm doing wrong",3
2349,"Too many five-star reviews on this novel need to be tempered by some more realistic assessments. I tried reading it but I just found the language flat. the ""freshwater"" metaphor and the many descriptions of the womb like a river and the baby like a fish seemed forced, hackneyed, and contrived. I skipped ahead and it looked like all I was going to find was a campus drama.",3
2350,"This would be best for a 3-4 year old child. It snaps together but it's not very durable. I don't expect it to last long. However, it is a cute gift and the music is fun.",3

2352,"Adding a review post 1 year of ownership. Mediocre quality. My daughter has been riding the bike to school and back for about a year. The headset (where the handlebar connects) requires re-tightening every few months. The brakes are a weak spot on this bicycle, they are finicky to adjust and need readjustment every month. The shifting system works as you'd expect for a $200 bicycle, clicks into gear but is not smooth. We haven't experience any of the chain issues some others have mentioned. Lastly, I'm disappointed in the quality of the bolts/nuts used on the bike, the frame itself and most of the components seem to be of decent quality, but the bolts had surface rust after the first winter (and we live in california so we rarely even have rain, just typical morning dew).",3

2354,"Thinner than expected, Heats ok.",3
2355,The birds in my neighborhood do not like these socks. Normally I feel up 4 socks every three or four days. These sacs have been hanging for a week and they're still half to three-quarters full. I'm going to empty the thistle into my old white bags at least I get to use the thistle.,3
2356,Smells great but not sting enough,3
2357,Very pretty but heavy to wear.,3
2358,Fine cups but you could probably buy these for $1 elsewhere. Good if you‚Äôre in a bind!,3
2359,Too watery but washed out easily in shower,3
2360,Straps fall down my arms and there is no chest or waist strap to secure the bag on your bag.,3
2361,"This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable! The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me. :( Too bad because I really did love it! So if you are purchasing this ring with the intent to wear it only occasionally, I say go for it!! You won't be disappointed!",3
2362,"I needed a small wallet that I could use during my travels. I needed something simple to carry the basic necessities. It fits the US credit cards and bills. I‚Äôm just disappointed with the color. I was expecting a more vibrant pink like on the picture but what I got looks very faded, a very light tinge of pink. Disappointed with the color.",3
2363,I enjoyed it - nice story,3
2364,The gloves are too tiny for my husbands hands. So that sucks,3
2365,Can't speak to how the product works but the package arrived torn up and filthy. The bottles appear to be ok,3
2366,NOT ENOUGH CHEESE PUFFS,3
2367,Bad writing but interesting concept.,3
2368,Didn‚Äôt look like an 80s hair style. More like a Trump wig,3
2369,"I love this water bottle. I drink a lot of water and I like it cold, so this suits me. I don‚Äôt use ice and the water still stays cold all day. Granted I don‚Äôt have it sitting in a hot car or directly in sunlight, as I‚Äôm sure that would effect the temperature some. I bought the pink one for my mother and she loves it as well. I‚Äôd recommend getting the straw tops that are sold seperately. Ours work fine and I‚Äôm happy I purchased them. However, the fact that the straw tops are an extra $10 a piece and the water bottle is almost $50, this is very overpriced for the quality of the product. I don‚Äôt regret buying it, but this is more of a luxury item IMO.",3
2370,"This ofcourse works best when the pineapple is straight which nature does not typically try to ensure. It cuts into the pineapple fine, but I think you have to be careful pulling it back out or you will end up with a bigger mess than just cutting the whole thing by hand. Unless you are eating pineapple every day, I don't think this item is worth it. It is also an inconvenient size to store",3
2371,"I saw this and thought it would be good to store the myriad of batts that I have. You must know that this is made to hang on the wall. The lid does not lock down in any way it just hangs lose and bangs into the Size C batts. You can lay it flat but remember the lid does not in any way hold the batteries from falling out if you turn it to the side, Now for me the biggest disappointment is that there are no slots for the batteries that use the most, the CR 123 batts. I rate it just barely useful. I should have read more carefully the description. It is too much trouble to return it so I'll keep it and buy smaller cases with locking lids",3

2373,"Looks good, don't plan on reusing year after year.",3
2374,"I would say these are ""ok"". First off, the color is not as metallic as pictured. They are CERTAINLY not ""hand painted"". They have a feel of like outdoor cushions which is not what I was going for, for my living room indoors. However, the blues are accurate which I needed to match the rest of the room. I have noticed my down throw pillows are sticking through them so I have questions about durability.",3
2375,"This is just ok, the LED bulbs do not last very long at all with everyday extended use.",3
2376,Just can't get use to the lack of taste with this ceylon cinnamon. I have to use so much to get any taste at all. This is the first ceylon I've tried so I can't compare. Just not impressed. I agree with some others that it taste more like red hot candy smells. Hope I can find some that has some flavor. I really don't want to go back to the other cinnamon that is bad for us.,3
2377,"We bought it in hopes my son would stop sucking his thumb. He doesn't suck it when it's on but when it's off for eating, bathing, washing hands... he will still do it. We are now going to try the nail polish with bitter taste. This is a good idea, my son just needs something stronger to beat it.",3
2378,"You stated that this phone was GSM and CDMA. It is GSM only. Had trouble with this phone since I got it. A couple of weeks ago it exploded. I say exploded, because the back blew off. I feel you should replace it with a phone like it, but GSM and CDMA compatible. I am very dissappointed. Debra Moss. P.S. I also feel that if the third party seller doesn't make this right,. Amazon should.",3
2379,not what i exspected!,3
2380,Not as long as the picture depicted,3
2381,Don't be fooled. You will be disappointed. Deleting it completely made me feel better.,3
2382,Its hard to leave a product review for my cats. The Cat Chews came quickly and 1 of my 3 cats are interested in them. The other 2 don't show a lot of interest although I'm sure it doesn't really have anything to do with the product itself. My 1 cat likes to play and chew on the cat stick.,3
2383,"It's cheap, hard to attach at first but overall does what its supposed to do.",3
2384,"Con and Mia, Rory and Emily, Bren and Gray each have a story that includes the O'Gallagher pub. The first two seemed to end with a potential happy ending. Sold separately like a cliffhanger. Good stories but choppy. A few glitches in proofreading but nothing to interfere with the flow. The third story brought the family together, gave closure, and everyone a happy ending. The last story reveals another secret of Bren's. Wrapping up everyone's ending gave closure, but would have made their individual stories better. More depth could have been given to each.",3
2385,"These are so sexy and perfect for short girls. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and they aren‚Äôt crazy long!! BUT the waistband is really freaking tight. I let my friend wear them and she somehow got the waistband extremely twisted, it took me 3 days to fix it. Yikes. But still cute",3
2386,"I've done a few so far but getting the hang of securing the foil to the capsule takes patience and practice. I've put holes in a few foils and had to redo them. I also think I need to try a different coffee because I haven't been real pleased with the flavor of the coffee. Also, the original foils on the capsules can be difficult to remove.",3
2387,"My cheese-loving teen declared he would have put this on his Christmas list if he knew this existed. One thing I love about this is the locking parts. A+ for that. No handle coming off mid-shred. The base even has a suction you can use to secure this temporarily to your counter. It washed up easily too. Like most rotary graters, small pieces of cheese failed to grate but a small loss for such an efficient finger-saving grater. Can‚Äôt wait to try on veggies. UPDATE: after using this creator only three times and only hand washing it, this piece pictured below busted off. Disappointing! It seems to be functioning fine without this piece but nonetheless I find is irritating.",3
2388,"Starter installed fine and works great in my 2006 Accord v6. However before install I found two of the three Phillips head screws on the motor housing were completely loose, not tightened at all and would have fallen off in a few miles. Be sure to check all the screws and bolts on yours before installing.",3
2389,Works the same for me as my name brand parts,3
2390,The bag seemed great but I had to return it since it was smaller than what I needed,3
2391,I love the look but it‚Äôs not as study as it looks. My wood cracked so I had to remodel it I contact the company and no respond.. and the part to place the mattresses is metal so on the full-size bunk the metals bend and crack.. not worth it if u have growing children that are active.,3
2392,"Easy assembly but some parts had a defect issue, still.waiting on parts but overall bed seems sturdy.",3
2393,It really didn‚Äôt work for me - wasn‚Äôt of any help.,3
2394,Not what I remember from previous purchases~,3
2395,Doesn't show roads I'm on and stopped charging like all my other Garmin's due to the adaptor plug in,3
2396,"It has a slimmer design shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to snag on and with the power cord as a permanent attachment, it's far less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect that is triggered in action gaming feels much weaker. 2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly. We are very heavy handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. So for us, making investments in controllers yearly means we have to be picky and prudent about what we purchase. The controller could do with more durable springs; after a couple months, buttons that are used the most stop responding and the right joystick loses it's centering, IE- makes map screens zoom in and characters walk forwards without even touching the controls.",3
2397,"I love the color of this dress! I got the purple color for a holiday party and it was gorgeous! My only complaint was that the straps were hard to keep from moving around constantly. I had to keep re-adjusting and making sure nothing was falling out. It also came wrinkled and was really hard to steam out the wrinkles, thankfully the event had dark lighting",3
2398,"It doesn't fit on the newer fish rims as most tanks have a lip around them that L's out for strength to the top trim of the fish tank without modifying the black trim. The lip has to be cut off for the bracket to for over it on the tanks edge. Average person would not have the tools to do it,",3
2399,way smaller than exspected,3
2400,Needs a longer handle but that's my only complaint. Otherwise works well.,3
2401,"i like the boots but they run too big, I am 53 and don't need to try on shoes any longer, they aren't growing. I know what size i wear and this is the second time i buy boots from this manufacturer and they are too big. Very disappointed.",3
2402,Until now I like the easy installation there is a lagging in the motion and the video and I didn‚Äôt put memory card now maybe I get a free one with Amazon,3
2403,Less tasty than the regular version,3
2404,Very pretty. Didn‚Äôt hang right on me,3
2405,Everything was great except for the fact that the shoulder strap that shows in the picture was not included in the package so the bag is actually wonderful but the shoulder strap wasn't there so if I can get a shoulder strap that would be great,3
2406,This is a great little portable table. Easy to build and tuck away in a corner. One big flaw is that the tabletop comes off easily. Adjusting the height becomes a 2 hand job or else the top may come off when pressing the lever.,3
2407,I'm really pissed off about this tiny brush that was sent with the bottle. This has to be a joke. I've purchased smaller water bottles and received a brush bigger/better than this.,3
2408,"This was semi-useful. I used this AND A LOT of other references (YouTube videos were the biggest help). I scored a 70 on the CLEP test but again, you CANNOT rely on just this book.",3
2409,I love what this product is suppose to offer but falls short. While it does hold my phone (iPhone X Max) in the cradle while driving and going over bumps in the road. (important) but it with each bump it chirps as if it quits charging then chirps again to start charging. The buttons to open the side arms is very awkward and behind the phone. Therefore only 3 stars.,3
2410,"The taste wasn't bad, however, it did raise my blood pressure. Therefore, I stopped taking it.",3
2411,"I initially was impressed by the material quality of the headphones, but as I connected the headphones to listen to my song there was a problem. There is constantly this weird ""old cable tv that has lost it's signal sound"" in the background when trying to listen to anything. Pretty disappointed.",3
2412,"This book was supposed to be new & it wasn't, the cover had some wear on it",3
2413,"Very soft and comfortable sheets. Would be great if I was using for sheets, but I bought because sheets are cheaper than buying material for sewing that some material at stores. And using this as material it was not great. Issue is it falls apart super easy even past seam lines. So if it gets a hole in it out will fall apart and will become unusable",3
2414,"It will do the job of holding shoes. It's not glamorous, but it holds shoes and stands in a closet. You will need help with the shelving assembly as it is a two person job.",3
2415,The CD is a birthday gift for my sister. We are both in our 60‚Äôs and think our music is the best. The CD arrive with a cracked plastic cover. I‚Äôm hoping it will not affect the CD itself. I am surprised the CD was sent in less than perfect condition. I am otherwise verrrrry satisfied with Amazon products and service.,3
2416,The net ripped pretty quickly and the basketballs have a small hole in them that filled with water.,3
2417,Was quite an enjoyable family movie up until the very end when the two of us were very disappointed with the totally unnecessary last scene ...too bad.......,3
2418,"I was disappointed to find that the blue bra is made of a cotton-poly blend while the others are just cotton-spandex. Also, the sizing is very small. I ordered a 32 which is up a size from my normal band size 30 and it is still very tight. I could have easily gone with a 34, maybe even a 36.",3
2419,Glass is extremely thin. Mine broke into a million shards. Very dangerous!,3
2420,Nice size Used on vacation Kept my clothes organized and clean,3
2421,Works great at a fraction of the cost,3
2422,"I received this carrier last night. I have yet to use it. It is very well constructed. It has a lot of places for my dog to look out. My dog is a 12-pound long hair chihuahua mix. She may be slightly longer than normal. She is almost too big for this carrier. Once she is in, she acts like she is claustrophobic. Once I zip her in and pick the bag up, she settles down. It is still new to her so we will see if she likes it later. It is almost the same process that I had with the backpack carrier.",3
2423,"I'm normally a medium in clothes and this fits perfectly on my waist and helps hide my chub, but it's SUPER tight on my thighs. I ended up just cutting a slit in them to alleviate so it didn't cut off my circulation, but even then, still pretty tight. Definitely order a size up.",3
2424,"Great price BUT were not stuffed properly and had to be opened for fixing. Also, I was under the impression that it was 2, but it's only one insert. My fault for not reading the whole thing so just an FYI.",3
2425,"Sound is pretty good. I wanted it for the microphone (Bluetooth connected to my iPhone), as well as for the speaker. But, the microphone isn't that good. You need to have it right by your mouth for the other person to hear you. If you want it just for the speaker, the sound is pretty good for the price!",3
2426,"I have used this item once. The fit is a bit larger then expected. However, I decided to keep it instead of returning, for now.",3
2427,"The gloves did the job. They kept my hands warm and were fitted enough where I could use my phone comfortably, but not too fitted that they felt tight. I would say I loved the gloves, but after 5 days of continued use (was in snowy Chicago for a convention) the sewing from the side of one of the gloves started to become undone. I continued to use them because I needed them for the rest of my trip, but won't be able to use them for anything else.",3
2428,"I have a feeling they were worn before , they came in a repackage but the stitching on the shoes as a slight pink hue to it ? Doesn‚Äôt really show up on camera. They‚Äôre still pretty new and fit a bit tight but I should have ordered a size up",3
2429,"Okay pool cue. However you can buy one 4 oz. lighter (21 oz,) for 1/3 the price of this 25 oz. cue. Not worth the extra money for the weight difference.",3
2430,"Great product and Quality. Not as deep as I would like: Optimistic is going to be perfect, but I would have bought the next size up:",3
2431,Maybe it's just my luck because this seems to happen to me with other products but the motor broke in 2 weeks. That was a bummer. I liked it for the 2 weeks though!,3
2432,Doesn't fit my spout must be to modern for it.,3
2433,This is literally just a cardstock. Not a canvas and needs to be framed to display. Not a good price considering all it is.,3
2434,"I'm still trying to remember why I liked Age of Myth, the first novel in this series. Whatever that was, it wasn't really present in the sequel. Though some of the characters are engaging and the overall story line is interesting enough, this book takes a few leaps that seemed forced in order to level the playing field between two races. A society going from the stone age to the copper age to the iron age (and discovering many of the technological and cultural advancements that come with those transitions) in a matter of weeks thanks to recurring epiphanies by two or three characters... well, let's just say it's all a bit rushed and bordering on repeated examples of deus ex machina (a phrase I've never used before, but which seems entirely appropriate in this case). Sadly, this book--which the author admitted is his favorite in the series--has me questioning whether to continue to Book Three.",3
2435,It‚Äôs cute but after wearing it for a few hours it hurt,3
2436,I love the concept of having flowers in my nails but some show up already broken in pieces they are to dry and thin,3
2437,"Watch was delivered with a scratch on the face and a few on the band. It looks like it would light up, or glow in the dark, but it does not. The face on it is much bigger than I expected as well. On a positive note, I loved the blue metal color and the bi-directional bezel. Ended up returning it due to the damage though.",3
2438,Wouldn't know how this fit because my narcissistic jackass of an ex threw it away when i tried to give it to him as a gift.,3
2439,"Had to drill out two of them to fit, but overall work great.",3
2440,Easy to find and carries well. Do not like that at times does not touch sensitive to answering iPhone disputes multiple touches,3
2441,It's cool I can turn the tv off via the hdmi cord but on routines doesn't know wether to turn the tv on or off,3
2442,Love the light. Fits with out furniture. Great overall but the floor switch isn't convenient to possible add a switch on the light itself. We ended up running the floor switch up between the couch sections so we can operate the light without having to find the switch on the floor,3
2443,"My cat loves these but they are all fish flavored. If your cat is prone to UTI infections like mine is, then you shouldn‚Äôt give them fish flavored food. After a week of giving him these, my cat got a UTI. I ended up giving them away.",3
2444,"I wanted to like these boots so bad, however, the leather looked cheap and the fit around my heel was just odd. There was space between my heel and the back of the boot but I definitely did not need to size down. The fit around my calf was fairly tight as well. Returned in hopes I'll have better luck with Frye.",3
2445,"They were really cute, I wore them a lot during the summer but they turned all brown and rusty and lost their shine after a couple months",3
2446,"The tunic part is great, the pants and hood are cheap, very cheap, kinda think they are universal costume pieces. Not worth $60+ bucks for a nice tunic in my opinion though.",3
2447,"It's okay. Bought it for my nephew, but I think it is overpriced. The quality is not built to last, in my opinion, but I do like the push forward and reverse motion. I also like that the tires can't be easily removed by toddlers.",3
2448,The quality is not great doesn‚Äôt fit much at all no extra pockets actually put stuff in,3
2449,"This hat will look good on a man or a woman. Nice wide brim. However it was large on me (and I have a big head). There is an adjuster string in the hat band which made it fit better. But adjusting it made the crown of the hat kind of ruffle up, which spoiled the look IMO. I returned it.",3
2450,This product is nice but there are a few reasons I am only giving it 3 out of 5 stars. They sent me hardware that I dont even think goes with this product. One of the eye bolts that hold the springs to the base is the wrong part. They shorted me a bolt that holds the two bearings at the base down so I had to dig into my private stash of hardware. If I wasn't mechanically inclined there is no way I would have been able to put this together with the instructions provided. They might as well not even waste the ink and paper because the pictures are to blurry to see anyways. It took me two hours to assemble this product due to the lack of instructions and organization.,3
2451,"This is the first book I've read by Marcia Clark and my last. Until the epilogue, I'd been thinking the story was too improbable to be great, but I was thinking I'd probably wind up buying her others eventually. Perhaps the epilogue incorporated information from a previous novel, but I could see no reason to include the shocking information. For me it ruined the main character.",3
2452,"Looks nice enough, but so far not charging my MacBook via USB-C. It shows as connected but won't charge...",3
2453,The beige mat looked orange on my beige flooring so I returned it and ordered a gray mat from another company that was $7 less to be safe on the color.,3
2454,there ok don‚Äôt seem to stay locked in grease gun fall out all the time,3
2455,"Not as pink as it looks, more lilac-y",3
2456,"I loved this bathing suit so much, but the padding in it was terrible. The padding is circular and it is very visible. Not a very flattering look. Wish the padding would‚Äôve been removable.",3
2457,"One worked perfectly, but the other one has a slight leak and we end up with water underneath the filter.",3
2458,It‚Äôs a sturdy product but the tires are very hard,3
2459,"The book is very informative, with great tips and tricks about how to travel as well as what the locations are about which is both it's good and bad aspect. It gives so much interesting context, it may be overly insightful. For the person who must know everything, this is great. For the person who has no idea. Googling will suffice.",3
2460,"I thought that this would be non slip, but it was not. A tube of ""100% silicone calking"" spread on the bottom side and spread out with a piece of cardboard and left flat to dry did the trick.",3
2461,This is way overpriced. It's literally a rubber cap that takes twice as long to get on your lens,3
2462,It started bubbling within a week of purchase and use. Thankfully they give you two in the package and the second one has been ok.,3
2463,It's good but very fragile barely tapped the top while washing and it cracked,3
2464,Would be more practical with a sturdier strap and possibly a small clip to attach to inside of my purse when I‚Äôm not wearing it.,3
2465,Remote did not work. Instructions for use were incomplete and difficult to read without a magnifying lens.,3
2466,eh. fun to take apart. made a throwing star from the blades,3
2467,"The game lags but it's still ok, if you're into these sorts of games",3
2468,ok don't care for cover on rod,3
2469,"Product as described, tic tac toe game. Very basic foam pieces, nothing special, wouldn't even know it's a tic tac toe game if you didn't have the X and O pieces out.",3
2470,"Terrific fabric and fit through belly, hips and thighs, but apparently these should be worn with 3"" heels, which is ridiculous for exercise/loungewear. (Yes I'm being sarcastic.) Seriously: these were at least 4"" too long to be comfortable (let alone safe to walk in). Back they go, and I won't try again.",3
2471,Working but a bit slow.,3
2472,I liked the easy install but they squeak bout as bad as the old ones,3
2473,"Bout the Medium bag because I have a Neverfull MM, but medium size is too small. Read carefully!!!",3
2474,Sounds a little fuzzy but great in a bedroom,3
2475,"I don't remember ordering these for my husband, but I do remember that he complained about some socks being too tight for him and that he had put them into ""the pink bag"" - things for donations for the paralyzed veterans.",3
2476,This is shown with utensils and salt and pepper holders. I have purchased one in the past and it came with the salt and pepper holders. This one did not. Make sure you know what you are getting before ordering.,3
2477,This is better used for baking. I made green tea and it added no sweetness like stevia does.,3
2478,I like the purpose and posible usefulness of these spatulas. My concern is that they are much thinner than I expected and I am afraid they make break quite easily. We shall see.,3
2479,"I really like this bag. Its easy to clean, stylish, and well made. However i purchased this bag in hopes of it being roomy and able to hold at least the necessities. I can not fit everything i need in the bag, unfortunatly if you pack the inside of the bag it poofs out and makes the outside pockets unuseable. Same goes for if you put things in the outside pockets you really can't fit more than diapers and wipes inside the bag. It is well made just not ideal esp for a large bag to be able to hold much. Ive already purchased a new bag from somewhere else and in comparison i can see how much i was suffering over stuffing this bag trying to make it work but it cant hold enough items for 1 kid forget it if you have 2.",3
2480,Loved that they were dishwasher safe and so colorful. Unfortunately they are not airtight so unsuitable for carbonated water. I just bought a soda stream and needed bottles for the water. It lost its carbonation ‚òπÔ∏è,3
2481,"Ordered the iPad mini case and did not accurately fit my device. Was upsetting bcuz it‚Äôs such a lovely design and good quality case. When I contacted customer service, they responded right away to fix the issue. Giving them an extra star for the great customer service!",3
2482,They work really well for heartburn and stomach upset. But taking a couple stars off as capsules are poor quality and break. I lost over 30 in a bottle of 120 as they leaked. Powder ended up bottom of bottle.,3
2483,"I'm almost done with this book, but its a little too wordy and not intense enough for me.",3
2484,Beautiful but too small for that price.,3
2485,"After adjusting the springs in the unit, the lamp works as advertised. I‚Äôm happy with the purchase.",3
2486,I am slowly losing my sight and bought this because I love to read and not everything is printed in large print. This is a pretty nice magnifying glass but the plastic frame is coming apart right out of the box. I'll have to use super glue to keep it together. I do like that it can be used with either left or right hand.,3
2487,It seems to work if you can get past the smell of it.,3
2488,"Had some problems getting it to work. The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery. When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC. Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info. PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case). The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth. Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.",3
2489,"Not even close on the size, maybe 13 max no more, loose fit yes, support marginal, but size is overstated.",3
2490,For a fitness tracker it is adequate. Heart rate monitor works ok. I feel it has missed steps in my everyday walking but if you start the monitor for fitness then it does well. If you hold anything in the arm with the tracker and cant move your arm it counts nothing. Battery life on the tracker is amazing. It lasts 7 to 8 days on a charge. It charges very fast. The wrist band is not very comfortable. Do to the way it charges i am not sure you can switch bands. I have not looked into this.,3
2491,Not as scented as other scents.,3
2492,"This is a nice case, good quality and it fits the iPad well. Problem is, it is HEAVY. I just weighed things to confirm what I thought. My iPad weighs 1 lb, 6.2 oz. This case weighs more than the iPad (1 lb, 8.7 oz). It is also larger to accommodate the Apple Pencil (which I don't use). As soon as I find something else, this case will be relegated to the closet. If it was lighter and didn't have all the extra size to accommodate the pencil, I would like it.",3
2493,"Goes on nicely, wears well, but didn't curl my lashes at all.",3
2494,"These pants run huge, ordered a size xl was more like a size 3x. They are also very long.. I can't use them, even though they are a nice pant.",3
2495,Great length but only lasted 6 months.,3
2496,Not the greatest quality but it‚Äôs for a middle school locker so not concerned about it.,3
2497,I was looking for space when I ordered this product and read on another review that the bag won't touch you when cycling. Definitely got a product with ample space but won't be using it much because I can definitely feel the bag against my legs when paddling.,3
2498,I like it but it gets all tangled together,3
2499,"Very cute, however, I only had it for a week before it broke. It was sticking to my case really well, but the end cap came off.",3
2500,I loved the album! It was very beautiful and came with everything. My only disappointment was I was given the wrong poster. A poster I already have. If you could fix this it would be great. Thank you!,3
2501,It was okay but the price is not worth it,3
2502,Easy to put together but didn't solve problem,3
2503,"I like them, but don't like the fact that they move about in the cup holders. I have to keep turning them to look right...",3
2504,"The ""leather"" strap broke the 1st time I wore it, I just tied it back together for now. I will replace the strap, but the necklace is very pretty.",3
2505,I guess they should put a filter pump better!!! There's not strong and when the water is dirty I have to clean the filter many time... But the pool is excellent...,3
2506,Half of the pads were dried out. The others worked great!,3
2507,My cat has definitely figured out how to move the tiny door over so I cannot use the first 1-2 wells. I would give it a higher score if it was a little more cat proof.,3
2508,Took a while to get used to writing style. Lots of turns in the story. Probably a bit too many for me. And also a tad too macho,3
2509,"I like the tags, able to conceal name and address by turning ID to the inside! I received 1 orange and 3 yellow!! Not what I was expecting or as advertised- disappointing üôÅ",3
2510,"Mirror has a great design, it is a mirror. But, i suggest you save your money and go to a store for yourself. The mirror has a 50% chance of breaking on the way to your house.",3
2511,The strap is to long it keeps drink cold for maybe 2 hours. its very stylish,3
2512,"Very hard, I bought some from trader joes and they were soft, the flavor was really nice though.",3
2513,The outer packing was rotten by the time it arrived and it can not be returned.,3
2514,works for the needs at hand,3
2515,White gets very dirty,3
2516,"Limited usability for B+ cups, risk of falling out",3
2517,"Bluetooth is nice but all the ear hooks just broke off. I've never had to replace an ear hook on my bluetooth. Therefore, I would not recommend.",3
2518,Unfortunately it just isn't that peachy. It's black tea with a hint of peach. Not what I expect when I buy a peach tea.,3
2519,Not good for small to average cup sizes or long torsos. I felt like it was pulling down on my chest. Otherwise good.,3
2520,The quality is very low; but what do you expect from a $30 dollar outside light; works but I wouldn't buy it again.,3
2521,Overall it‚Äôs a nice bed frame but it comes with scratches all over the frame. It comes with a building kit (kind of like an IKEA building kit) so it takes a while,3
2522,Like the product but not to happy that the funnel was crushed.,3
2523,"Megaphone was missing, but I only really needed the pom poms for a kids costume.",3
2524,Should have a lower volume. The lowest is too loud to sleep in.,3
2525,Just doesn't get hot enough for my liking. Its stashed away in the drawer.,3
2526,"Im giving it 3 stars for now, i don't want leave a bad review for the seller unless he deserves it but this drone overheats a lot. Im not sure if i should contact the seller or dji tello themselves but ill probably try both just to see what they say. I like the drone is a cool little toy that fly's better than some bigger older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However its the only drone i have ever had overheating issues with and it actually takes the fun out of flying im going to assume for now that its a manufacturing issue which they need to address asap if they want there product to be successful. I really hope the seller did not send me a use drone as i paid for a new one. I will give the sellers props for delivery as it arrive 1 day after purchase. I will update date my review after contacting seller and dji tello.",3
2527,This product is a good deal as far as price and the amount of softgels. I also like that it has a high EPA and DHA formula. The only thing I don't like is the fish burps. Maybe they need to add more lemon to the formula,3
2528,Should have read more reviews. Sounds like you need to be ready to sharpen this one every 2 or 3 fish,3
2529,"Some panties were way too small but most for just right. Cute, good variety, good price.",3
2530,The pockets are so small I couldn't fit my phone in them. Aside from that's it's a nice fall t-shirt dress,3
2531,Started using it yesterday.. so far so good.. no side effects.. 1/4 of a teaspoon twice per day in protein shakes.. I guess it takes a few weeks for chronic potassium deficiency and chronic low acidic state to be reversed and for improvements on wellbeing to show.. I suggest seller supplies 1/8 spoon measure with this item and clear instructions on dosage because an overdose can be lethal,3
2532,"This heat press is really loud to operate. When clamping down the handle, it hits a bolt which is loud. When releasing it, it makes the entire press come of the table, which makes another noise, plus the actual press makes a really loud banging when it releases. Everything else is fine.",3
2533,Would rate higher if would actually stay suctioned down.,3
2534,Cheaply but great price for what you get,3
2535,"Boards are nice, however the only way to connect them with matching grid lines is to follow the number sequence on the boards. Don‚Äôt just pull one out and connect-the grid lines do not match. And after starting to block a large project I RAN OUT OF PINS! 150 included??? NOPE!!! More Like less than 100 !!! grrrr. I chose this item over others because it was supposed to include a lot of pins. It not completely as advertised.",3
2536,Comfortable. NO support for any type of cardio.,3
2537,Its good for the loose skin postpartum. I'm gonna use it for another waist trainer. Not tight enough.,3
2538,"Didn't expect much for the price, and that's about what I got. It covers and protects my table, just have to live with a grid of folds from packaging. Seller advised to use a hair dryer to flatten out the wrinkles, but it was a very painstakingly slow process that only took some of the sharp edges off of the folds, didn't make much difference. Going to invest in something better (and much more expensive) for daily use, this is OK for what it does.",3
2539,"This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.",3
2540,good but should be thinner,3
2541,I have other better fitting Fobus holsters for different guns. Fit with the SP101 and LCR is just ok. I wouldn't repurchase this and may look for something better. Probably because it is designed to work for multiple guns.,3
2542,"Pins on the charge port became bent after use. Bottom line, they work but need to be more careful with lifting/placing the controllers in/out of the base.",3
2543,Didn‚Äôt work as well as a similar plastic product.,3
2544,"Salmon bars are dry, fish flavored and dense. The buffalo and cranberry are awesome.",3
2545,"I was surprisingly excited to try this gadget. It came in a really nice looking box within a box and it was easy to figure out how to use it. Be careful the first time you try it, because even on the lowest setting it has really powerful suction. The first spot I tried bruised before I figured out how to detach it from my skin. You may want to practice it on a less delicate area than the face the first time you use it. PROS: -very nice box with magnetic closure - nice assortment of tips - includes detailed instructions (in varying quality of English) - has very strong suction power CONS: - easy to bruise your skin with this - didn't seem to have much noticeable effect, at least in the short term. Overall, this did not give me the wow factor I was hoping for, but does have very strong suction",3
2546,Very thin plastic that broke putting it together. Will tip over without using the stakes.,3
2547,"I find it difficult to get excited over a bag of pig tails, but due to the vendor pressuring me to leave a review, here it is: The cables seem to be well made and of the two that I have used so far an adequate amount of electricity appeared to be flowing through them. The small icon on my laptop illuminated to indicate that A/C power was being used, but I didn't notice if the % of battery changed any during that time. Currently, I have no reason to recommend a different product.",3
2548,And it‚Äôs not impressive but... I do love ferrets enough to waste $,3
2549,Really nice looking but very heavy and sweats easily.,3
2550,I love the product. My only complaint is there was only one screw in the box. I have used 3 other mismatched screws. I would love to have three more screws.,3
2551,"Lots of improbable action and questionable police work. It moved quickly and to its credit, the book was not boring, but it was just to incredulous for my taste. I found no characters that I really cared for. To me, this was a sample of what a three Star book is. Okay, not terrible and not great. Sorry I read it? No, but if I had it to do over I probably would pass.",3
2552,"This item appears to be the same as one I purchased from a local hardware store a year or so ago, but it is not finished or burnished to the quality of the one I previously purchased. As such it looks dull, but not exceedingly so. It is close enough to be acceptable.",3
2553,Expensive for a kids soap,3
2554,"It was great while it lasted, but it started falling apart after a couple of months. The brown inner lining ripped from the inner seam of the leather and it's not really fixable. Not great for long-term every day use.",3
2555,It was a good story but a little to drawn out for my taste.,3
2556,"Very Pretty, but doesn't stand out well without a solid base coat. Great for little girls who want unicorn/fairy nails and when you don't want a bright color.",3
2557,The puck seems to roll/stick a lot on this board.,3
2558,Game concept is great and a lot of fun. The headphones do not cancel all noise unless you press them to your ears. The sound that the headphones play is a bit disturbing and will drive you crazy. :),3
2559,"It worked... terrible. Very poor quality. I am very disappointed. After using it around one week, I have to say Rubbish.",3
2560,In the question and answers someone said this was safe for cats. I'm not an expert but my bottle says do not use on cats. Wish I would have known,3
2561,"It‚Äôs ok for what you pay for, didn‚Äôt seem to wow me. It keep it mostly clean and scratch free. Seems like it‚Äôd rip easy though.",3
2562,"The first guard may serve more as a learning curve. I do kinda prefer to use the ones that come with molding trays. This didn't help until about 3-4 nights of use. Even then, sometimes it feels like my upper gum underneath, is strange feeling the next morning",3
2563,"For the price its ok, I think. I ordered the second hand version and also got second hand. Parts are broken, which I then repaired myself with tape. Since it is a clothes horse is not quite so tragic, the indication, however, that the part is almost new is not right. 3 parts are broken and had to be taped. The quality is rather low, but as I said, it has to hang only laundry on it. However, I like that you can fold it.",3
2564,"I bought this vacuum to replace our Kenmore vacuum that I loved and had for over 10 years. I didn't want to buy another Kenmore since Sears is filing for bankruptcy and this seemed to be another vacuum in the price range that we were looking for and was well reviewed. The vacuum works fine, but I have to say that I hate, really HATE that I have 2 vacuums now, instead of 1. I don't care about the extra weight or bulk, but when I am vacuuming, I don't want to have to haul around 2 vacuums. Just give me one, so I can get it all done at once. I didn't think it would be a bit deal, but now having purchased this vacuum, I just want a stinking hose on it so I can suck up all of those hard reach spots....and I don't want to have to go and get the other ""vacuum"" to do it.",3
2565,Smudges easily and collects in corners of eyes throughout the day. Goes on smooth and rich without clumping.,3
2566,"Horrible to make it working on Windows 10, maybe a Windows problem. Works fine on Ubuntu. But for something free after rebate, not much to complain about.",3
2567,"Can't complain too much.. like I said, you get what you pay for. It'll do for now... measurement was way off.. did the best I could to improve it and it was still off a bit. Might end up returning.",3
2568,A little pricey and it was ok. I like the Seaweed Company products better and Oil of Olay.,3
2569,This did not work on my vynal setting on my cricut it was a little disapointing! But still beautiful paper,3
2570,"I am not sure yet, it doesn‚Äôt look very healthy",3
2571,These socks are cute. And soft. But just not tall enough. Maybe it was because I have size 10 feet? Lol But I was trying to find something to replace the no-show socks I wear in the summer. These don‚Äôt cut it. I don‚Äôt need to expose my ankles to cold winter air. They also left horrific dents in my legs after a few hours of wear.,3
2572,Was OK but not wonderful,3
2573,Cute idea but unfortunately they tend to leak out the sides. My Lilly didn't mind wearing them but I have decided that baby diapers work better. Wish they fit like baby diapers around the legs to help prevent leakage.,3
2574,"Cute bracelet, but the gold wore off after a few months of wear. Guess you get what you pay for with this one!",3
2575,So many pieces...I thought they were already assembled so I didn't use them at the party,3
2576,Drains so quickly . Not satisfied,3
2577,"Wanted to like this shirt but it is way too clingy and 'Muscle Mapping'--or in my case, lard mapping. Material it's made from instantly made me perspire. Gave them to my roommate and she loves them! Cannot recommend.",3
2578,"very tight fit, very hard to draw the weapon",3
2579,I was surprised by the item when I got it and actually thought they had sent the wrong thing. I was expecting something more substantial. I haven't tried the program yet and will have to see how it goes.,3
2580,"Awkward shape, does not fit all butter sticks",3
2581,"The DE is as expected, but the little pump is flimsy and difficult to use. This also was ineffective on fleas.",3
2582,"They are great, but they‚Äôre made for kids hands.",3
2583,"Really disappointed. I literally opened my package, put them on, and discovered he Velcro on the left hip was halfway torn off. I can sew it sure, but why would I have paid $40 for pants I would just need to sew Update: while initially upset, I did manage to sew the Velcro back on nice and snug. Taking them out Sunday to ride. Will update review based on Sunday‚Äôs performance.",3
2584,Not super durable. The bag holds up okay but the drawstrings sometimes tear if the bag gets past a couple lbs.,3
2585,These were great gifts however I was short 1 stocking in my order.,3
2586,Not a magnet backing on this as mentioned in the details. Velcro...I bought this because it had a magnet backing only to find out it did not,3
2587,I love microfiber towel but this is just way to small. Most curly hair girls have a lot of hair and this is just not big enough for my daughter's hair.,3
2588,Received damaged haven‚Äôt received new one yet,3
2589,Nice just not as fancy as I thought. T-shirt material. Nice tho,3
2590,"In the case of these rings, you get what you pay for. They are easy to wear and I chose them as my fingers changed size temporarily during pregnancy. However, they do not feel particularly study and over the course of a month or two stretched out to be nearly unwearable. I ended up losing two that became too loose. When I replaced with others from the pack, and was reminded of their original fit, I realized that the stretching had occurred.",3
2591,"Cool bag with graphics, but smelled like mildew.",3
2592,one bag was torn when it's delivered,3
2593,I read a review from someone stating that this case had a lip on it to protect the screen. That person is mentally insane because there is zero lip what so ever. very annoyed,3
2594,I'm not really fond of these new ones. The one end that is supposed to be used to remove the used guard doesn't work. I have to pry the old one out with my fingernail. I wish they still made the orange ones.,3
2595,After 5 months I have lost some of my debit/credit cards. The slots became too loose and the cards slip out easily. On the other hand the case used as a phone holder/protector works great. The manufacturer needed to add a strap or mechanism to prevent cards from becoming dislodged.,3
2596,"I ordered 2 gyros and I must say that they rather cheaply made. If you're want a gyro, that's great. If I was to buy a gyro again, I would spend a little more for one that is built better. Don't be hesitant to pay a little more for yours, it will make a big difference.",3
2597,"For the money, it's a good buy... but the fingerprint ID just doesn't work very good. After several attempts, it would not allow me to register my fingerprint. So... I just use the key to lock and unlock the safe, and that's not a problem. If you want something with the ability to open with your fingerprint, you'll need to spend a bit more, but if fingerprint id isn't something you absolutely need to have, then this safe is for you.",3
2598,"It‚Äôs very, very low to the ground. My son actually broke this quite easily on accident. We still use it, but it can‚Äôt be fixed.",3
2599,Just like you would get at the dollar store.,3
2600,"He has an original Vive and couldn't wait to upgrade. The fit of this is wonderful compared to the original, however we sent it back, as it has a lot of bug issues he was getting to frustrated with.",3
2601,"These hooks are very attractive and sturdy, however, they‚Äôre much smaller than they appear. They‚Äôre great for small needs. I needed them to hang curtains, but they weren‚Äôt big enough. I thought of using them to hang mugs so I wouldn‚Äôt have to return them, but they were too small for that purpose, as well. The bronze finish is very nice.",3
2602,"I love a lot of things about these slippers. They are adorable - true to photo. The high-top design of the opening not only keeps my ankles warm, it also keeps the slippers from coming off easily -- and from shopping around, this seems like a pretty unique feature. The slippers are very well-padded and feel very snug on the foot (although most of the padding is actually on top of the foot; there's not much padding on the sole, so if you're walking in these a lot, it will probably flatten.) All of these aspects make me really want to love these slippers. BUT I'm so let down by the fabrication. They seem to have focused entirely on the exterior of the slipper and ignored the interior. I want these to keep my feet cozy. But the interior fabric is not very soft, and doesn't feel good on my feet. Even worse, there is an exposed seam running around the interior of the slipper -- i.e. the fabric is sewn together, and the two ends are not tucked behind the seam, but extrude into the interior of the slipper and poke into my feet. Basically, every time I wear these I want to put on socks, to make my feet more comfortable -- but if I'm already going to put socks on, I don't really need the slippers, so... NB: I followed other reviewers and ordered a size down than suggested by the sizing chart. The Medium fits perfect on my women's sz 6 feet.",3
2603,"Glad I ordered a 3x to be on the safe side, fits more like an xl. Definitely size up",3
2604,Gave as a gift....? If it actually wirks,3
2605,"These monitors arrived fairly quickly and they're a great deal but the packages were in ridiculous condition. Big boot footprints were on two boxes, a big hole in another and all of them were crushed pretty good. I haven't opened and setup the monitors yet but I'll be surprised if some aren't damaged. Probably need a new shipping company or contact them about the shape some of those are in.",3
2606,"This story took me a while to get through. I think the way the characters were introduced was good, however, for me the story took a turn the way the plot was laid out took a while to get there. A good read if you are into family stories. I thought The Hundred Foot Journey was better.",3
2607,olive oil would work just as good,3

2610,These bandaids work great and I‚Äôve ordered them before but this time the box came to me torn open. But the shipping packaging was intact. So it means I was sent a ripped up product.

2611,"This product does not hold a cellular phone of normal weight. The device keeps falling off of the dash board of a car if the car hits a bump and the car vibrates. Also if you have applied any assist devices to the back of the phone, you can not attach your phone to the phone holder.",3
2612,I bought this because my original charger finally gave up on me. This one won‚Äôt stay inside my phone. The charging piece won‚Äôt stay inside my phone.,3

2615,It's not as good as it looks but it's nice to hold and easy to put on,3
2616,"Not worth it. It works, but not as good as I want it too. Bought a different one that works much much better",3
2617,"I used this product to take rust stains off my concrete driveway. It reduced the stains, but did not remove them completely. I'm hoping our Southern California sun will do the rest .",3
2618,I bought these because magnets don't stick to stainless steel. Neither do these.,3
2619,"Once installed we realized that it's missing a gasket or something behind it to seal it to the shower wall. Water can just run behind it because it doesn't fit tightly. It looks great and I like it, but we have to figure something out to make it more functional.",3

2622,Great material just runs small,3
2623,Very good size but not very well insulated. It does not hold temperate longer than 4 hours.,3
2624,A bit smaller then what I expected can only use two outlets as the outlets are very close together. If you plug in ones with a big end you can only use two.,3
2625,instructions where not very clear. Still not sure if I received all the accessories.,3
2626,This item takes 2 AA batteries not 2 C batteries like it says,3

2628,All three pair fit totally different yet are same size. Black one stretched out. Turquoise is small and gray is good. Definitely not high impact bras tho,3
2629,ok. Typical Chinese,3
2630,Not exactly what I was expecting. Packaging was not in the best condition. Lights are bright and lots of different combos. Very thin light rope and was long enough to go around my mirror.,3
2631,"sound is not so good, but is OK",3
2632,The pictures in Amazon are deceptively clear and white. The stones received can be best described as champagne in color. Comes with a nice little gift box which makes for a great presentation. The size is also great for the price. Amazon images should be updated to reflect actual color of stones received.,3
2633,"I was very disappointed in the product. It is a fizzy solution which is not comfortable in a sensitive stomach (Also doctors advises not to have ""carbonation"" so why would they put it into that type of solution?) Secondly, it had a sweet taste and I would prefer little taste as I do not like sweets when I first get up in the morning. I was unable to continue using the product and therefore I cannot comment on its effectiveness. Too Bad as I was very excited about it.",3

2639,OK for the price but the lights that the description says it has either do not exist or do not work. the charger part itself works though so i did not bother to call and complain,3

2643,"I want to love it, it's a solid tool and I got it because my friend used his chain breaker with this tool to save me on a long bike ride. The case is cool too. But why only 3 stars? Well it fell apart on me on a couple occasions and the parts went every where. Kind of sucks that I need a tool to fix a tool. And when it fell apart the first time I didn't and then I guess my hand tightening wasn't enough. I've still yet to dig around to fine the correct size tool to fix it. I don't even see why it is so easy to take apart? Also I wish I would have gotten a tool with a 15mm. On it's own it wouldn't be a huge deal especially since a couple of my bikes don't need it, but enough of the bikes I work on do. Even if it was like an optional side item. I've seen other tools for the price and size with it. So to sum it up. It's not a bad tool, I've done some wrenching with it. I've also had to wrench it and it's parts have fallen on the ground on more than one occasion, for the price I wish I would have gotten something else.",3
2644,"Bought this for my granddaughter, who is 18 months, for Christmas. It is cute and she loves it. The only criticism I have is the music is very loud, even on the low setting. In fact it is so loud, my daughter won't take it home. So it stays at Nan's, for her to play with when sHe visits.",3

We have purchased the Princess Belle dress from this company and loved it because it has a zipper on the back and is so easy to get on. Because it's difficult for my daughter to pull on, she tends to not play with it nearly as much as her other dresses.

2654,I washed it and it lost much of its plush feel and color.,3
2655,"After a lot of research, I started using this product many years ago. It had the least amount of harmful ingredients, and still worked okay. However, it dries up so quickly that you end up using so much lube, which ends up costing a lot of money, as well as being too disruptive during sex. I've just been too lazy to look for a new product, but will start looking for one that is both harmless, works well, and not too costly.",3
2656,Wore it when I went to the bar a couple times and the silver coating started to rub off but for the price I cannot complain. My biggest issue I have with it is it flipping around. Got a lot of compliments though.,3
2657,"I am giving this product a 3 star do to the fact when I got it in it was broken already inside. Once I examined it I realized whoever put it in the box put it in there broken, This could have either been the manufacturers packers or for the manufacturers sake the problem could possibly be that a buyer returned the item and claimed they just didn't want it or didn't need it and Amazon possibly did not do a good enough quality check when it came back. In all fairness the buyer couldn't have said it was broken because then Amazon wouldn't have taken it back which is good especially with this kind of product either way though I am the one who got stuck with someones negligence. I did however get my money back so after thinking about it and discussing it with my spouse I have decided to give this buyer another chance. With that said I will only update my rating to a higher star depending on how customer service handles this post (by at least addressing it) and if the item comes in great shape, actually has the opportunity to do what it does, and works well doing what it is supposed to do.",3
2658,"The product is fine and the delivery was fast, but there's no way to seal the package once it's opened. There's a wide piece of tape, but you have to cut the package open to get into it unlike most wipes that have a slit with an adhesive to cover it afterward.

2673,It's a dystopian movie but wasn't executed well. Emma and Tom are good.,3
2674,Bought this for wheatgrass but barely any juice from a whole tray of homegrown. The juice always comes out from the pulp chute first everytime for some reason until pulp clogs it up. Does Soft fruits and vegetables great but harder ones need to be cut into smaller pieces. Harder types tend to have dryer pulp than the soft which come out pretty wet for some. Relatively easy to assemble but theres couple rubber pieces that needs to be removed to cleaned and remember to put back when it dries or it will leak. Cleaning the pulp out of the tiny chute is a pain and nearly impossible if it gets clogged up. The screen on the other hand is impossible to get fully cleaned no matter how much you scrub it. The fiber will cling to the mesh screen on first use.,3
2675,I purchased a refurb one for my wife. The bowl is supposed to be easy enough to put on my mother has one. The one we got you have to force it down. Some times when you turn it on low it doesn‚Äôt come on at all. It‚Äôs not even worth returning to the seller bc i‚Äôll Loose money on the return and another shipping cost. Hopefully kitchenaid will handle it. My wife loves the pink color at least.,3
2676,To big for me to swallow.,3
2677,Only 3 stars because one came rusted. Not sure how that happened. Luckily I only needed 2. So it worked out. Those were fine. Works for what I need.,3
2678,"Makes this slim phone bulky. Well-padded, good protection.",3
2679,Beautiful but runs big,3
2680,Stingray emblem looks like it was painted on. Not raised at all. Took like what seemed forever to get here also.,3
2681,"Looks lovely in photograph, but is a bit flimsy, but I will still use it.",3
2682,I could not wash out the chemical scent of this bra. I realize cotton is highly sprayed with pesticides; but the chemicals in this garment were intense. Sent it back. Companies MUST take more responsibility for their customers‚Äô good health when using their products.,3
2683,I hardly ever write bad reviews but this pair of shoes are so narrow and they are supposed to be M. The outside of the shoe looks like plastic or vinyl definitely not leather. I hate to return but I will give these shoes to the Goodwill.,3
2684,"These would be 5 star but....... there are no cleats on these mats,so everytime someone gets in they SLIDE around just enough to be annoying. So I'd say 3.5.",3
2685,"It is not enough bright , light is medium goof for small frame",3
2686,The coil works just fine but the thermostat is a piece of junk it broke after a couple months so I put the original back on and it's working fine.,3
2687,I personally didn't care for it seemed to really dry my skin out. I was going to return it but my mother decided to just keep it and try it herself.,3
2688,Hard to see the hands of the watch here with the white background.,3
2689,I love this ball and the squeaker makes it that much better. My dog is super ball motivated and i don't know a dog that doesn't like squeaky toys. My only issue with this ball is that my dog kills the squeaker within the week. Other than that it's a nice toy for dogs.,3
2690,"The fit is kind of weird. Super tight to body. I'm 5' 5"" and 150 lbs and ordered XL and it was still tight. Could've easily gone a size up. I'm going to keep to wear underneath other tops and they also might inspire me to lose a few pounds!",3
2691,It's a good thing the battery on this unit is replaceable because the one I got was dead on arrival. I got this for my son as a gift and he had given up on it as junk before we finally got a replacement battery from the store and bingo - came right to life. He's enjoying it now. It was quite easy to set up and the volume on the device seems good. He's been able to find his keys upstairs while signaling from downstairs. We've probably only tested it at a range of about 75 feet so I can't vouch for the range claims. Just be aware that you may need to do a battery swap to get the thing working.,3
2692,"Used with an adult cat. Based on other reviews I should note there are two main reasons for a cone. To keep an animal from scratching their head, OR to keep an animal from biting or licking their body. This is only good for the second scenario, which is what I needed it for. The cat does not like it as much as the clear plastic cones, but any of those big enough to keep him from licking his sores also prevent him from eating and drinking. This keeps him from reaching his incision (rear leg amputated) with his mouth, but he can still get to food because it is cloth. It does seem to make him feel more trapped and bummed out, but out of the three I ordered, it is the only one that covered the medical need.",3
2693,This is ok but its rather large mm and sheds more than most,3
2694,Item arrived damaged to corners and bent in middle with crease.,3
2695,Does not give out that much light,3
2696,"I ordered (2) packs of packing paper but only received one. I called Amazon and they credited my account for the missing pack. It was packaged in plastic wrap that was torn open and the paper was exposed and ripped up a bit on the edges. I plan to keep since it will just be used as padding in boxes, but the packaging/delivery needs to be improved. Very disappointing but the paper itself seems to be pretty good quality.",3
2697,Its ok just really short,3
2698,Doesn't hold temperature as stated. It is hard to drink water from it for a toddler,3
2699,No instructions and hard to tighten,3
2700,"I should've just stuck with the regular 6 egg cooker. One level never cooks the same as the other, so you end up with one level being either undercooked or overcooked.",3
2701,"This product isn‚Äôt easy to adjust to where you need it to sit. I‚Äôm having trouble with mine. The plastic adjuster pieces also dig in under my arms. The chest strap sits really high on me. I‚Äôm going to try to us it and see how it performs. It does seems made well with good materials though, and it‚Äôs very lightweight. I may return it.",3
2702,"I like the coverage that this product offers. However, it does cause my skin to be extra oily and break out when I use it so not going to be able to use it for much longer. Everyone is different though so it may not break out your skin.",3
2703,Well the drain sits flat on the bottom of the tub so the water doesnt drain out unless u prop it up and u gotta watch baby sliding/rolling around on the laying side and getting to some of the harder parts to reach could be easier to get to...,3
2704,Ordered this product twice and was sent the wrong product twice.,3
2705,Very nice robe but a bit long. Husband is 6'. Will have to hem the robe. Too warm for summer.,3
2706,"bought 3,000 for my son who has autism, play room. They were delivered very quickly and are a decent size. My only complaint would be that there weren‚Äôt 3,000 total. Each boxed claimed to have 1,000 each and I was shorted a couple hundred.",3
2707,They are huge!! Want too big for me.,3
2708,I bought this puzzle with the intention to glue it together and frame it. I spent a few nights putting it together only to find that I am missing a piece. I am obviously frustrated because if I still want to frame this I will need to re order just to get that one piece.. I was really excited about this and planned to buy a few more puzzles from this seller.,3
2709,"I am finding that the battery life has issues I did not find when before I got this phone ,it is a very nice phone I have to disable everything WHAT GOOD IS THAT it is a common issue with this phone like I said Its a Beautiful Phone but what good is it if I have to keep it plugged in or cant use the programs designed for the phone Very disappointed not sure if im going to keep the phone",3
2710,"Decent for the price. Have not experienced any warping, did stain from first use but was not having high expectations for these anyway. Still using.",3
2711,The range is terrible on these units. I have to pull all the way into the driveway before it will activate the door. We do like the size and that they are keychains.,3
2712,Annoying how it has to be just at the perfect angle in order for it to respond ... it works but I would not buy it again.,3
2713,My son loves this watch very much. No problem with it. He loves all the features.,3
2714,Not terribly uncomfortable,3
2715,"I'm real happy to have finally moved on getting myself something to record this kind of stuff in. The keeper is cute and the size is handy and portable, but the lines are kind of small to write on. It's similar to a ""little black book"" from back in the day. Nothing more, nothing less.",3
2716,The consistency of this color started gloppy and after a few uses has gotten a lot worse. The color is nice and if you can get the application to go on well; it is a very nice white. But it's not a smooth application. I'm still in search of a white color that is easy to apply and comes out pretty and opaque.,3
2717,"You can tell it's cheaply made. Just from pulling it out of the packaging, there are small holes in various places. My 1 year old still really enjoys it, though. It's huge! Also, be prepared to stock up on balls. We got 300 and it doesn't even begin to fill this thing out. I would say at least 500 needed.",3
2718,"Arrived today and a bit disappointed. Great color and nice backing, BUT not thick and plush for the high price. Except fot the backing, you can find the same thickness at your local Walmart for a lot less money.",3
2719,"Not up to par with other Hallmark ornaments of this sort. Namely, it's lacking the magic I've come to expect from Hallmark. Having said that, I'm glad it's part of our ever-growing Christmas family.",3
2720,Leaves hair feeling and looking very oily. Smells great. Hold is awful.,3
2721,Wish this had more taste. Was very excited to receive only to be disappointed with lack of flavor. Perhaps add a low sodium bullion cube to enhance flavor.,3
2722,Runs very large. Order 3 sizes smaller!,3
2723,"This got great reviews online and moisturizes very well but the fragrance is pretty strong. If you're sensitive to strong smells, you might want to opt for something unscented. Otherwise, good product.",3
2724,"I was happy with the product and how it made the tires shine for days. On the other hand, the nozzle would not stay in place and the product would leak all over the place.",3
2725,Corner of magnet board was bent ... would like new one sent will not adhere to fridge on the corner,3
2726,It‚Äôs a nice looking item that keeps my puppy safe but after a few weeks some of the holes where the zip ties go through have ripped off the plastic just due to the wind.,3
2727,"This is a hard review. On one hand it is great because I finally found a protector that fits the V30 like it is supposed to...so 5 stars for the fit! I haven't tested durability...new phone so I would rather not put it through a bunch of durability tests! But the screen itself it awful. Streak marks and fingerprints are so prominent...but it does not seem to impact the touchscreen ability. All in all, it is the only one I have found that fits so I will stick with it untill something better comes along.",3
2728,"arrived quickly and in good condition but picture and the size shown are different, what's shown is much smaller than what i actually received. just be sure to read over everything to make sure you get the right size; don't just order based on the picture like i did lol.",3
2729,My son loves sunny bunnies and this was a perfect gift for him. Some parts are glued on the sunny bunnies i will fall apart after some use.,3
2730,When I washed them they shrunk I order a bigger size because I knew they would shrink a little but they shrunk to much,3
2731,I feel like they sent me the wrong one maybe. This one is mostly a white background. It looks like I have a big white bandana over my sunroom window.,3
2732,It had analog problems were my player would move left on its own.,3
2733,4 year old loves this musical jewelry box. The lid stopped closing properly the first day she had it; it no longer aligns properly requiring an adult to jostle it closed.,3
2734,"Really cute outfit and fit well. But, the two bows fell off the top the first time worn. The bows were glued on opposed to sewn.",3
2735,"Much smaller than expected, not very comfortable. Wish I could return",3
2736,"This gets three stars because it did not give me exactly what I ordered. I ordered 4 of the 100 card lots. So, I wanted 100 Unstable MTG cards per box. Instead, I was given 97 Unstable cards per box, and 4 random MTG commons. I paid for 100 Unstable cards! Not 97 and 4 random cards! Also, the boxes they advertise are not too great. They do the job of holding the cards, but that's about it. I'm definitely getting a new case for these. If you want to buy, don't take it too seriously. Don't expect all 100 cards to be Unstable, and expect multiples.",3
2737,"One of the product pieces arrieved broken and bent. In order to re attatch, it would need to be welded. Without that piece, the bottom tray will be lop sided. The other shelves are fine and usable.",3
2738,"This was attractive, fairly grippy, fit quite well, and was well designed. But it did add some weight, and did not help me hold the kindle while reading - which was the main goal.",3
2739,"As another reviewer noted, the caps are loose and you lose some of the product in shipping. This needs to be resolved by the manufacturer.",3
2740,"Thre drawers on these just didn't work for my makeup, so i had to send it back. The small drawers hardly hold anything, and aren't long enough for my mascara tubes or eyeliners, thus rendering then useless for me. I ended up finding a different one that has worked much better.",3
2741,"The wife and I are Seniors. Seniors tend to lose hair. Can't be helped. She has a very small area that is thinning. Therefore she decided to give this product a try. It works... kind of. Hard to put on. Hard to stay in the hair and if one shampoo's regularly.. it of course washes out. If the price were down... WAY DOWN we might play with this stuff again. However, the value just isn't there for what the product does. We won't buy again.",3
2742,"these were ok, but to big for the craft I needed them for. Maybe find something to use them on.",3
2743,"Works great and the picture is good, but it doesn't hold a battery long at all. I actually have to plug it in every night once I lay down or it won't stay charged.",3
2744,It is not really 100% WATERPROOF,3
2745,The Length Md Width of the the item is gppd but the only thing i dislike is that the date on the bottom is wrong its supposed to be 1944 not 1994,3
2746,"Title says much. Chemical sensitivity exists for many people, and use of fragrances has declined over the years. So what idiot decided to send new shirts into the market smelling like TIDE? After a few washings it is out, but not good!!!!",3
2747,"Had to return this item, the electronic chemical smell was so bad it stunk up the entire house and the food cooked in it. Made me sick and we couldn‚Äôt even eat in the house for hours. Like another reviewer wrote, the smell was so overpowering it was impossible to use it.",3
2748,"This smells amazing! I love the scent....however as a deodorant? It just doesn't do the job for me. I wish it did, but it just mixes with B.O. and that's no good. It might do the job for a few hours, but no way does it work all day. I just use it as a perfume. For that, it is lovely.",3
2749,"Lighter than expected, made a nice gift for our newly commissioned friend.",3
2750,the price is expense for the item. I guess your paying for them to deliver it to you.,3
2751,"The process was pretty simple and straightforward, and I ended up using the entire mixture all over my hair. After leaving it in for at least 30 minutes and following all the steps, it still didn't cover all my grays. It did mask a good portion of them to blend more with my hair, but I wish it would've been complete coverage.",3
2752,"The deck is beautifully crafted, the designs stunning and the accompanying book informative. However, I did not like the fact that there are no reverse meanings included.",3
2753,This hose is VERY thin compared to the one that came with the air conditioner. Wire popped out the end the first time I installed it. I say first time because it would not stay attached to the air conditioner. The coils seemed a hair too small and would slide straight out any time someone (or even the cat) bumped the air conditioner or the hose.,3
2754,Love this but smaller than expected. Nothing wrong with it just not enough pretend play in it.,3
2755,I was really thrilled with these spatulas until the colorful tops started to come right off at the drop of a hat! I won't buy this brand again...EVER!,3
2756,"This is a very cute bedding set, but it is cheap feeling microfiber. I can get something from Pottery Barn for just a little more but much better quality.",3
2757,"Not the wig that came, but I can work with it . The front was much much shorter than the wig in the picture",3
2758,"This is a decent example of a 2-piece case for the Axon 7 that doesn't add as much bulk as an Otterbox. The hard piece wraps securely around the sides of the phone, but the soft layer is actually very easy to peel back over the top and bottom, meaning you could very likely drop the phone at an angle such that the silicone peels back as it impacts and thus doesn't protect the phone at all. That being said, for the price, the overall level of protection, and the fact that there doesn't appear to be an Otterbox or other more substantial case available for this phone (that I've seen, anyway,) this is still a good case option.",3
2759,Order up. I think I'm DONE ordering clothes on amazon. Always so very small!,3
2760,Looks good. Clasp some times does not lock completely and the watch falls off. One time it fell off and the back cover popped off. I do get lots of compliments of color combination.,3
2761,"The plastic wrap covering the address section falls out easily. Not high quality, or long lasting. Got the job done for the trip.",3
2762,This one is funny. I bought two of them. It works well on my computer but hates my wife's computer.,3
2763,Returned the item. Did not work in my house,3
2764,Terrible back light bleeding. Will do what I need though.,3
2765,The fitment isn‚Äôt perfect with the lines of the car. Slightly noticeable from some angles but love it.,3
2766,"I bought this specifically to use washing my 4-wheeler. I really liked it at first as it was flexible, easy to use and easy to store, but after using it 5 or 6 times I found the inner core had separated from one of the ends, rendering it useless. I was actually going to buy another one to use around the yard, but now I‚Äôll try something else.",3
2767,Pretty but cheaply made. Broke first time I put on,3
2768,did not fit around my big belly but the refunded the price .... very easy company to deal with!,3
2769,"I really Like this ring light! It is wonderful for the price and it gets the job done! The only issue is the light bulb heats up too fast and the light goes out, so I have to turn it off wait for a while then turn it back on. I don't think that is supposed to happen...I don't know if I have a defective light or what, but it is a very nice ring light besides the overheating.",3
2770,"Still working on it,, its kind sour",3
2771,"Didn‚Äôt care for the fit, so returned. However, I have a problem with finding something that fits.",3
2772,Not her best but still very good writing.,3
2773,"Good Quality pendant and necklace, but gems are a little lacking in color.",3
2774,"This wasn't my favorite bag, but it wasn't my least favorite either. The bag is very long. As a result it's a bit cumbersome to carry by the handles and the strap doesn't have much padding. My large Dell laptop was swimming in the laptop sleeve. But, it's lightweight, was nicely padded in the laptop sleeve, and had sufficient pockets for organization. I ended up replacing it because it just wasn't comfortable to carry every day. I'm petite; maybe it's better suited for someone with a taller frame.",3
2775,"Good size desk for sewing with draws for storage of parts and thread, and a draw for storing a sewing machine. Not a bad unit for the price, but the quality is below Ikea and similar type furniture I have assembled. While most parts fit together well, some of the draws did not. Either they fit tight in the desk slides or did not align flush to each other on the front. One draw side had to be plugged and re-drilled to allow the draw slide to fit properly. The wrong guide bumpers for the machine draw were packed with the parts, which the company said it was aware of, but is shipping out the replacement parts. An option we would have liked would be to be able to switch the base pieces to opposite sides, but that cause a little more work and may up the cost of the unit. It was well packaged to protect it from damage during shipping. The box was quite heavy, so be prepared to have help bringing it inside.",3
2776,"I would buy it again. Just as a treat, was a nice little side dish pack for nights when me or my husband didn't want to cook.",3
2777,It doesn't hold 24 cans. I've only had it for about a month. So far no leaks. It holds about 12 to 16 cans with ice. The side pockets are great to hold odds and ends. The front pocket is insulated.,3
2778,Too early just recieved,3
2779,"I would call these a real mixed bag. These chews are HUGE! I like to give my dog one rawhide chew a night, but these are slabs of rawhide, not a chip or normal chew by any stretch. On the flip side, the taste must be OK, as my dog at it. She actually stopped and left it after devouring about half of it, which is unheard of. Not sure if it was just too thick and she was tired, or what. But picked it up and she ate the rest the next night. Not optimum for me, but not horrible. If you have a big rugged dog, these might be great. If you've got a little dog - don't even think about them.",3
2780,I think it‚Äôs very cute but it needs to protect the phone more. Specifically it needs to come up around the sides higher to protect the glass. It‚Äôs also pretty slippery.,3
2781,"Good sound and decent battery life for the price, but doesn't charge very well. The cord it came with didn't really work from the beginning. I had to use another cord I had. It loses BT connection randomly and that's when I know it's out of battery life. Even though it shows over half charge in the indicator on my phone. It never warns via the speaker with a sound or LED indicator, just drops the connection and sometimes makes the powering down sound.",3
2782,reception is quite bad compared to your stock antenna on any whoop camera. just buy the normal antenna,3
2783,Cute bag zipper broke month after I bought it.,3
2784,I was hoping for better,3
2785,"This was labeled as a good drone for beginners, and it was not, and it was marketed to work with the app, but not all of the functions were available in the app for the X2.",3
2786,"I like these storage bins overall. The color of the lining inside wasn‚Äôt expected, it shows a light brown color in the photo but it‚Äôs pretty dark. I would have preferred the lining inside to match the outside, tan or grey. Other than that they are cute and look as pictured.",3
2787,Not used. No lable in it to make return,3
2788,Was too loose for my 4&5 year old...,3
2789,Limbs could be longer,3
2790,They are comfortable if not a little heavy material wise. But the big disappointment is they have a hole in the pocket already. They are barely a month old,3
2791,After 5 months the changing rainbow light has stopped functioning. Still works as an oil diffuser at least. It was cheap so I guess that's what you get!,3
2792,"Great for the money. The device has gone out on me a few times, though. Still, not a bad product.",3
2793,"After hitting the remote a few times, its working now.",3
2794,I was disappointed with these. I thought they would be heavier.,3
2795,"understated, but they did not look good on my overstated face.",3
2796,"A bit of a different twist on the rags to riches story. However, there was some repetition, class discrepancies and fleshing out needed. It was, over all, a sweet story. While I hope the actual physical copy of this book has few typos, the e-book is riddled with them!! I can't imagine any author being happy that their book is so poorly copied.",3
2797,It works okay for listening to music with headphones but never works when I'm trying to use it for a call. Just splurge on the real product from Apple.,3
2798,"not very well made product, the grommets are not matched in distance/location and one of the grommets fell out as soon as I removed from package. They were prompt about refunding my full purchase price.",3
2799,"the phone itself is fine, no lagging etc even with multiple programs open, it does most of what its supposed to do, and it does it well. the camera is decent in the day but is pretty bad at low light, probably worse than some of the other midrange phones. The headphones accompanying the phone were not usable, not an issue with sound quality etc, just way too short to be used.",3
2800,"A small portion of the rubber surrounding the front of the case started peeling off/bubbling within 10 days of normal use. I‚Äôm thinking this issue is not widespread...? Hard to hear when phone not in speaker/Bluetooth mode. Besides those issues, the case fits perfectly and protects the phone as advertised.",3
2801,Meh. Not as stylish as I would have thought and not very sturdy looking. 10/10 do regret.,3
2802,"A bit hard to get used to using. My husband prefers using disposable razors to this one. I have to agree. Overall, it is a great razor if you're patient enough to learn how to use it, and patient enough to go slow while shaving.",3
2803,"While this little gadget has been helpful during nursing school for recording lectures, it is now not working (2 years of use)-I haven't finished nursing school yet, and am right in the middle of a semester :'( Pros: extremely easy to use! Cons: can sometimes be accidentally switched on in a bag; always has to have the time/date reset",3
2804,Bus is what I expected EXCEPT it does not have the stop sign on the side as shown in the images. Disappointing as I chose this bus over other similar options because of the realistic feature,3
2805,Can't say the product has worked or not until I see if it extended the life of the connecting cable. To be honest I would've like that the Klip covered part of the connector. It wiggles easy so I don't know if it will extend the life of the cable.,3
2806,A decent training tool but it really needs to have some sort of Safety Lock over the shock button( been pressed more on accident when it's in my pocket then I've actually intended to use it) my dogs even accidentally zapped herself after stepping on the remote. Also if your dog likes to roll around in raccoon poop like mine does it is such a pain in the butt to clean. As the fecal matter gets in between the cracks of the device requiring you to disassemble the entire thing to clean it properly and get the smell out. Also the range is a bit inconsistent. I've noticed you almost need line of sight for it to work. And there have been times where it has not functioned at all even though I'm only 30 feet away from my dog. Being rechargeable is certainly a nice feature and the charge does last for a good while. I only need to charge mine about once every two weeks.,3
2807,Too large in the waist for my skinny daughter.,3
2808,"Lots of lines, not easy to color. Definitely not for kids or elderly .",3
2809,Good but arrived melted because of heat even though it had been boxed with ice pack which was melted!,3

2811,I returned this item and was never credited to my Visa,3
2812,I had breast reduction surgery and this bra is soft and supportive. The problem I had was with the stitching on the rings between the straps and cups. The edges are rough and it was itchy and very annoying. I ended up wrapping band-aids around the ring area and this solved the problem. Surgical tape would probably work too.,3
2813,"They are okay. I haven't struggled with engorgement, so I can't attest to the cold side, but the warming process for pumping wasn't really helpful at all. Its a lot of work to get it warm before pumping, and by time your 1/4 done its cold, making it not worth the hassle. (I didn't notice much of a change anyway) It was helpful in clearing my clogged milk duct though.",3
2814,I love it and can‚Äôt wait to wear it. It looks just like the picture,3

2817,"I'm a sculptor and need to keep my materials damp. This has worked really well for me, but little by little it's begun to behave erratically. Now It wont work at all.

2822,"Man! What can a girl do to get decent panties?! I used to shop at Victoria Secrets but when their management changed so did their quality and I don't want to spend good money on sub par underwear. So then I tried Target and some of the underwear was good but other pairs feel apart immediately. I was apprehensive about buying underwear in bulk on line but I thought I'd give it a try. I'm 5'8"", 125 pounds and I am and have been a small always. That's my size. These guys ran a lil small for my taste. Now not all of them, but certain colors are made of different fabrics so some fit while others do not. It's weird. If I had bought them in person I probably could have seen the size discrepancy and picked/bought accordingly but you can't do that online. However, they are much cheaper than any where else so maybe that's the trade off. Either way, I'm not super thrilled and will not be buying these guys again.",3

To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail. There is none in mine, which is fine cause again, mine came up shorter than others. Im only rating 3 stars because of some unintentional good things.",3

I can't give it less stars than 3 as it may just be my dogs and not an issue with the product. I also cannot give more than 3 stars as I had no way to verify that the product was emitting a signal to the dogs.

2895,"3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.",3

2900,Based on reviews I played it safe and ordered large. It was not flattering and medium would have been a better fit. There was too much room in the lower part of the dress that would ride when I walk. It was a decent quality for the price but not the best for any formal occasion.,3

Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn't destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I'm giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The ""tail"" rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!",3

The box which, actually, was shipped from Office Depot was damaged when it arrived; however, the cartridges appear not to be damaged. I'll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn't make sense to me.",3

I would probably use them in other situations as well if they were all the same.

Also, the picture on the package used much thicker yarn and different pieces than what came with the package. It got the job done but looked different and was difficult to figure out at first.",3
2963,"The furniture is a bit smaller and lighter than what I was expecting, but for the price it does the job. I probably will do a bit more research for future outdoor furniture buying, but for now this set is good enough.",3
2964,Well constructed. The padding really takes it a step above similarly priced items.,3
2965,They did the job but the holes in the shutters were not deep enough to receive the pins...and the staples were extremely hard to insert. I was able to engineer solutions using the product (which I definitely had to have)...so all is well that ends well.,3
2966,"Several capsules were opened, spilling their content inside the bottle.",3
2967,"I purchased this bike for the sole function of being able to be folded in half so I can fit it in a car easier. As far as accomplishing that task, it is wonderful. Now to the nitty gritty. The bike comes with a Shimano rear derailleur, which works well as you would expect from a known reliable manufacturer. However, both of the shifters and the front derailleur are cheap aftermarket brand and NOT Shimano, despite how it is described. The shifters are loose between each gear stage, and too stiff to shift up to higher gears in some cases. The front derailleur is very difficult to adjust because of its cheap make, and the metal it is made out of is also very cheap and the whole derailer became unusable after spending some time just trying to get it adjusted. The seat pole is too long and interferes with the frame suspension, but that can be easily solved by cutting off a few inches of the pole. Basically, if you're someone who knows a lot about bicycles and how they work, this is a great bicycle frame with a unique design that can be very useful, but out of the package it immediately will need a few modifications and new front derailleur and new shifters if you plan to use this for serious riding.",3
2968,My maltipoo is 11 weeks and 3lbs and can escape this pen. I have no idea how but I've secured it several times and he continues to escape. It is of no use for us.,3
2969,"I love the look of this necklace. After wearing it for 24 hours, the chain broke where the locking clasp is attached. Very disappointed with the chain.",3
2970,This book was one of a number of books which I have read on this subject. It is good to read about people who show compassion; in the hope that it leads one to follow in the steps of decency and courage. It also shows that there were people on the side of the aggressor who did not want to carry out the atrocities of the governing body at the time. This holds true in the world today and brings to mind that wealth and power are not worth loosing our compassion and dignity for.,3
2971,"Very pretty, but the leather came away from the metal clasp within 4 months...",3
2972,"Besides running small, the arms have no warm lining, and the strings came frayed. It's wearable and the warm lining in the body of the coat is VERY soft, so I'm keeping it, but I almost returned it.",3
2973,Attracts small ants.. at least in S Florida,3
2974,"I ordered a new helmet because the one I‚Äôm currently using is too big. I have a large so I ordered this one in medium. Shipping was SOOOO fast, very impressed by that. However the medium that I ordered was even bigger than the large I had before so I had to return it. I sent it back the very next day and still have not gotten a refund. I like the helmet and planned on ordering a small once I got the refund for the medium but it‚Äôs been 16 days and they still say they haven‚Äôt received the item. Getting a little discouraged.",3
2975,"I have replaced batteries many times in android phones in the past. I knew this one would be difficult, but i didn't know how difficult. I watched a number of videos ahead of time which, of course, made it look easy. i did everything according to the instructions, but the battery would never attach properly using the lead that is pictured. The videos made it look like the lead would snap right onto the connection point. It did not. I was never able to successfully attach the battery. I was out the money for the battery and the phone was useless.",3
2976,Hair is perfect for low temp curling but not realistic. This is a tiny head from the movie Beatle juice . Not for advanced cutting class,3
2977,"Got this for my husband, I didn't know only 1 would fit his router. But that 1 cuts great",3
2978,would be great if it was wider.,3
2979,You get what you pay for. This starter worked and then it didnt withing a few days it didnt work anymore. It may have been just a faulty one but I dont know.,3
2980,Not happy. Not what we were hoping for.,3
2981,Doesn‚Äôt come with fulling inside i have to buy it my self thought it will be an regular stuffed pillow,3
2982,"I would have given this product a 4 but the gloves are so huge. The photo is an adult female hand, and this is supposed to be for kids?",3
2983,Didn't catch many fruit flies.,3
2984,"They‚Äôre OK.. I guess for the price they are good but the pads that goes inside are so poor quality, the bra is comfortable... good to use at home but I wouldn‚Äôt purchase again",3
2985,"Although the skull cap is 100% what I ordered, I continue to be dismayed, that this item, as well as others that I have ordered from Amazon; depicting officially licensed US Army Veteran gear is made in China. I for one would gladly pay a premium if this product and others could be manufactured and sold in the good ole US of A!",3
2986,VERY disappointed that the Amazon sticker is directly on the vinyl and ruined the first inch of vinyl.,3
2987,"Nails are cheap, glue is acceptable, the file also ok... not too expect a lot for this price!",3
2988,pretty case doesnt have any protection on front of phone so you will need an additional screen protector,3
2989,These are great but they didn't hold up long before they started threading..but that's what you get for the money.,3
2990,Received the wrong ones :( I really wanted to get the two shark monster trucks and I received completely different ones !,3
2991,I don't know why they would make these things with a plastic-ish material on the inside against your skin. It's sweaty and itchy and uncomfortable. I don't sweat much when I work out but I had to keep opening these things up and scratching and drying my wrists. Otherwise they work great but I need to get some wrist sweatbands.,3
2992,They didn't transport well got a little melted but still had good flavor,3
2993,"After I gave it to my pet bunny, she didn't like it as much.",3
2994,"I almost never buy shorts online because it's very hard to find what fits. I bought the dark blue ones in a Small and they fit perfect. The only problem was that unfortunately it doesn't do much for my behind. I consider myself to have a cute behind but for some reason the shorts didn't accentuate my bum, it made it look a little flat. I decided to keep them because they are comfortable, but I would only wear them with a long t-shirt. I liked the high waist part of it, you need a small waist for this since as they go higher up it gets smaller and tight.",3
2995,I like this flavor the most. Just very expensive on here,3
2996,This is my first pair of Wellington boots and I am very disappointed. They are WAY too loose and they leak. I'm returning them.,3
2997,These gloves are nice and look great just wish they wrist part was longer. The shortness took away from the costume showing a break between the costume sleeve and the gloves so you could see the kid's wrists,3
2998,"Nice lightweight material without being cheap feeling. Generally the design is nice, except the waist. The sewn in waist band is high. If you are long waisted , it would be way above your waist. I am a medium which is what I ordered. The waistband is about at the last rib in the front. When you tie the attached belt there is an improvement. OK as a house dress for me. I'm 5'4"" and it's bit bit long. I just knotted the corners of the bottom hem...that works.",3
2999,Unfortunately as other buyer states clips do in fact break easily if not installed square on bore of wheel.,3
3000,I like the built in flashlight - it does the job. I like the standard batteries and that they are relatively easy to change.,4
3001,It serves its purpose. Love it,4
3002,They work great easy to use,4
3003,"Look great, good quality. Needed to cut a notch in the drivers side front support bracket to get it to fit properly.",4
3004,"The product is great, I have been using it for the last 45 years. The web page to purchase it was very easy to use which facilitated the purchase and the price was excellent.",4
3005,I like this fabric. It's very soft and comfortable. It came out of the bag with a strong musty smell. It was fine after washing. Love the throw pillows. Wish the shams were reversible like the rest of the set. They could have easily put the opening on the end so both designs could be used. All in all very happy with this as a warmer weather bedset.,4
3006,"Dress fits perfectly. Item is as described. Disappointed there are no care instructions. The dress is extremely wrinkled and I now have to pay to have it professionally cleaned and pressed to remove the wrinkles... all that aside, it is a beautiful dress.",4
3007,"I put this pair of flamingos on my shower doors. The legs are a little tricky, but you just need to slow down and take your time. I am very happy that this decal is repositionable.",4
3008,Gift for my grandson. Good book. Very cute. LOTS of dialogue!!,4
3009,they do seem to keep the bugs off the outside light but they are not very bright,4
3010,"for the price and what it is for I can't complain, you can also wear it on the wrist",4
3011,These are very comfortable and I like the variety of colors as I wear many different colored pants.,4
3012,"2006 Honda Accord sedan. Had a difficult time trying to install unit. Fully assembled, the unit was not fitting into the small space. The arms were hitting and I could not get it to go in. Not sure if this is the way to go, but I disconnected the rod from the motor gear so I could ""flatten"" out the linkage. Once I did this the unit slid into place very easily. The only hard part was reconnecting the arm to the motor gear. You have just enough room to fit your fingers in behind the linkage. Then you have to press, HARD, to get it to ""snap"" into place on the ball. Other than that issue, everything seemed to go smoothly.",4
3013,The jasmine smells amazing. The Rose smells cheap. Overall decent quality,4
3014,Clear and detailed. The author brings the facts and the actions without any judge or reasoning behind. It is truly a policy report style,4
3015,Covers your lady bits well however its more of a one to two time use kind of thing,4
3016,"I am a Ballistic fan, however, not finding many cases to choose from. The iphone 8 plus does fit but barely. The corners fit well and has good padding - not enough padding/lip on rest especially top & bottom.",4
3017,"Like any good Biblical fiction, this makes me want to re read the Biblical account. Thank you for the hours of research this novel shows.",4
3018,It puts a lot of pressure causing pain. Put a folded hand towel on it for padding,4
3019,Works and fits great...keeps dog hair off the seats,4
3020,Great jacket for a great price. I honestly cannot complain. It keeps me warm though sometimes leaves feathers behind. Overall a great buy! Will buy in another color,4
3021,Works great. Does not irritate my gums.,4
3022,"They were very comfortable but my toes touched the top on the right shoe and since my left foot is a little smaller, it slipped quite a lot, just too big.",4
3023,"I have owned 4 pairs of these boots and I have been satisfied with all but one pair. Those seemed to have poor quality not sure why. As for the other 3 pairs they have been through a beating and lasted for up to 3 years each. They wear great and are tough. I have used them for work, hunting, and hiking. Great boot for the price.",4
3024,I used this product to cover the drawers of an old dresser. Now it looks very chic and expensive. I would definitely recommend this product to others. I used a felt covered applicator (just search Amazon for wallpaper kit) and I didn't encounter any bubbles with the product. Very easy to use if you have the right tools.,4
3025,Easier to handle over standard style walkers although not as stable and secure. Hard to find the replacement guides for the bottom. Folds nicely and is very light weight.,4
3026,Love the series. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the whole series is not available on Kindle. üò•,4
3027,"Just right for us, towels, first aid kit, tools, personal emergency toiletries, our pizza üçï bag, folded up cooler bag and extra tissue box. BUT HAD WE NOT FOUND THE PERFECT BUNGEE CORD TO SECURE IT, IT WOULD SLIDE ALL OVER. 4 stars for not having a rubbery base so it wouldn‚Äôt slide at every stop and turn. Note: our success was in part to measuring every thing that we wanted to put in it and where it would go before ordering!",4
3028,"Bought this for my children to play with, all under the age of five. It has held up remarkable well despite repeated use and is aesthetically pleasing to boot. The only difficulty, putting this bad boy together. Plan to put some time aside to follow the picture book instructions that appear to have been drawn by graphically challenged individuals with cataracts. Also, to increase the sturdiness of the wood pegs (used to hold certain pieces together) I used wood glue. All in all, good little set up. Would definitely recommend.",4
3029,I liked it. It just jammed a few times about 20-25 staples on and off. but it got the job done. ups not a bad price,4
3030,good price. I always have a spare set around,4
3031,"Chair came fast. Already put together and ready to go. Instructions are old for xbox 360, Wii and PS3. So those need an update. You're going to be sitting straight up in this chair. No reclining back. Could use more padding on the seat.",4
3032,Attractive. Love the magnetic closing. Loop for Apple Pencil became loose. Now it falls out.,4
3033,Great set for the family,4
3034,I think for the price it's very beautiful. It may or may not turn your wrist green I wouldn't wear it in the shower or anything but it's very very pretty for costume jewelry.,4
3035,This pole is longer than most of other poles on the market.,4
3036,These are my favorite crayons for my kiddos. Son used them as a toddler and now my daughter. They last a long time and color well.,4
3037,"This is a great gift for any kid that is a plane enthusiast. It was really easy to put together, but one down fall is that the tail piece doesn't seem to snap in very well, so it can be pulled off rather easy. The other wings seems to snap in tight and there are no issues with those. The lights are really bright, and the speaker is loud enough, but not too loud. It doesn't seem to work on carpet very well, but works great on wood floors or outside in the driveway. Over all great gift, it would be a 5 star if the tail piece didn't off so easily.",4
3038,I didn‚Äôt use it but the green I was expecting from the picture is a normal hunter green and what I received is a very light color green. Just doesn‚Äôt do it for me so returning. Have been using the hatchbox stuff and it‚Äôs great but I love amazon so gonna give it a go with the dark blue,4
3039,Exactly what I was looking for. Quick delivery.,4
3040,Seem good - I like this style of earbud - we'll see how they stand the test of time.,4
3041,Containers hold up well and generous in size. Best thing is that it is much lighter than pots and takes up minimal storage space.,4
3042,"Exactly what I was looking for. Nice height adjustable easel. That said the directions were in Chinese, but I was able to follow the pictures. Please look at the picture I had to clamp the bottom tray just touching it will cause it to fold. The clamp solved the problem but any child using this can collapse it easily.",4
3043,"It's kind of hard to review medicine since I'm swallowing it, not tasting it, and it doesn't have any physical effect on me. Package arrived quickly, bottle was easy enough to open, and soft gels seem to be the appropriate count (I'm certainly not counting). They don't stick together or leave a weird color on the bottle or anything else that someone might complain about.",4
3044,Great straps for short sets. They do slip but if you like to space out your sets then you have plenty of time to adjust them,4
3045,"Didn‚Äôt last long, but manufacturer replaced it.",4
3046,"Works okay, it doesn't work exceptionally well, but I don't have anything bad to say either!",4
3047,"What a great game. Easy to learn and can be a blast. This unit is made kinda cheaply. It's wood, just extremely light. The tiles get knocked down very easily.",4
3048,Classic movie featuring Bette Midler. I saw this movie years ago and was great to revisit this on DVD. Fun to share with people who haven't seen this movie.,4
3049,I enjoyed this book. The story was well-written and the characters were so life-like. I definitely recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this author.,4
3050,"It Cuts extremely well. I'll give it a 5. The blade turned on the edge brownish, but I worked on it & it's okay still cuts. Good for the money for simple cuts. My observation. Adult supervision extremely advised.",4
3051,This will be great book for sous vide food lover. This book providing some awesome sous vide recipes . Those recipes are so tasty and healthy. Enjoying those recipes. Loving stuff.,4
3052,"I gave this cooler a test run at home, prior to my upcoming trip. I put in 4 bottles of water and filled the cooler half full of ice. I checked it every 4 hours. The ice was completely melted after 12 hours, however the water stayed cold for 24 hours. Best of all, the cooler did not leak! With the benefit of folding flat this will be great to put in a suitcase and use on my next Las Vegas trip. Hotels in Vegas rarely have in room refrigerators, so this cooler will work perfect without leaving a puddle of water.",4
3053,I used this product in combination with my diet/ exercise to help lean down. Both products were a great addition and I could tell I dropped much needed water weight .,4
3054,Love this protector but the color has turned yellow. Still very durable. The color doesn‚Äôt effect the use of this.,4
3055,"Expensive, but won't oxidize metal. Maybe better than soap",4
3056,"Great easy device for tracking my miles and workout times when my bike is on the trainer. The instruction manual that comes with it is useless, so I had to search online but it wasn't hard to figure out by looking at all the parts that come with it.",4
3057,Seem to work. Just as cheap as the originals that came on the Cargo trailer. Remember the weird looking screw head is likely just a square drive and not a torx or allen. UPDATE: BOTH broken in less than a Year. Both the rod and the piece that goes on the trailer have broken. So I just went to the local RV place and got metal parts. If you don't have any wind or Employees that don't pay attention you may be o.k.,4
3058,Good for a temporary fix if you have company and need something that you can pull out of a closet or from under your bed. I would get a protective covering when storing besides the one on it because it is white and can get stained very easy. I wouldn‚Äôt use long term but for a couple of nights it works when my son comes and spends the weekends.,4
3059,"I originally ordered the 3x top, but it was a little too big in the bust. Sized down to the 2x and it's almost perfect. A little bit of rolling up, but other than that, super cute top.",4
3060,I got this for Yeti mug as reminder of how much I loved my nursing career. I thought I applied according to directions but the bottom part of the heart peeled up after a few washes. (not in dishwasher) I eventually just removed the whole stethescope. I did enjoy the pattern and color choices of the creation.,4
3061,"It's really a toy, not binoculars. The magnification and construction are good, but the field of view is TINY. You have to really get the width adjustment right or you won't see much. A little frustrating for my 4 year old, but good enough for older kids who can adjust themselves.",4
3062,"Pros: Easy assembly, about 20mins with 2 people. Directions good. Looks nice and very sturdy when all assembled. Cons: Some small scratches on metal frame. Some discoloration on wooden slates but easily hidden with a furniture marker. A couple of minor warped slates.",4
3063,"It did an o.k. job, not that impressed.",4
3064,"Although the packing was suspect, pieces were out of the plastic bag, they were all there. I am looking forward to being able to use it. I am still trying to return the original shipment.",4
3065,"Opened box and sadly disappointed as unit is Plastic and not steel! Unless I missed something, I didn't see any mention in description of material. I assumed it was steel and we all no what happens when you assume!!",4
3066,"On the S8, the side edges of the case don't completely cover the raised/curved glass of the phone, but other than that, nice looking / great texture.",4
3067,Super warm and stylish hat but runs large on me. Well made and washed well without fading or losing its shape.,4
3068,Worked like it said it would,4
3069,A little basic and could use more variety but my son loved them!,4
3070,Ordered to use with western themed tree! Blends with the theme well.,4
3071,"when you run out of power, you need to re-adjust the time.",4
3072,"This novel is reminiscent of the old Victorian style romances, with some unsettling twists and a great tale of self discovery.",4
3073,"Really good book, but there is some minor editing issues and I'm not sure if it is because I read with black background and white text. But the text going from gray to white to sometimes blue kinda throws me off. Still a good book and can't wait for the next one",4
3074,"Not quite the right length, but looks good",4
3075,So overall I like this flag. The colors are bright and the material feels good for the price. Not cheap but I definitely wouldn't keep this outside in bad weather. The one bad this about this is my flag smelled awful when it came out of the package. I bought another flag with this one and they both have this weird chemical smell. It's give me a headache and they haven't even been up 30 minutes. I sprayed them down with odor neutralizer and it helped for a few minutes. Definitely try to air out your flags before you put them in a room or anything,4
3076,This smart bulb works great and functions exactly as advertised. It has wide range of colors that you can pick from. Having a light tint color help me concentrate when I'm reading or studying.,4
3077,"Well made product. Now, only time and use will tell.",4
3078,I bought this protein every month but cookies flavor is bad,4
3079,"Pretty nice, the app interface could use some updating. Looks good behind my 55' tv.",4
3080,Great for so many of my recipes. It holds together nicely. Its a bit thinner than i thought.,4
3081,this is well made except that ours came like it was used. I don‚Äôt if it‚Äôs paint or what but it was all over the set for the hand. see photos. it is still well made and i‚Äôm probably just going to ask the seller to replace the ones that has paint on it cz my son absolutely loves it and doesn‚Äôt want me to send back. it functions as it should but it just looks used to me. can‚Äôt imagine how paint would end up on the items except with use.,4
3082,Little big but works good,4
3083,"These did help with curls, but I needed a second package due to my extra long and think hair. I was surprised at how comfortable they were during sleep.",4
3084,"Insane ending. A little too insane, but I will say I didn't see it coming.",4
3085,"So for the cost its a good value.. it came in plastic, of course, and it smelled so bad i had to spray with febreeze. like dousing in febreeze and leave it outside. it smells like chemicals you would use to burn something with. pretty gross. I know my little guy is going to ride in this.. but not for hours and hours.. so i will put a blanket and such in there to make him comfortable.",4
3086,Like it but the topper doesnt stay put easily,4
3087,"Excellent quality shirts in my opinion but absolutely they run large. I will toast mine in the hot water washer and dry on high to see if they'll shrink down, and report back. The sleeves of the t-shirt are longer than the sleeves on my short-sleeve button down shirt.",4
3088,Very easy to install. Took me no more than 30 minutes total. They look amazing! The only reason why I gave them 4 stars is the fact that I noticed a little bit of flex in the steps when I use them. I'm 230 pounds so I wouldn't recommend them for anyone significantly heavier than that. This is for my wife's lifted Jeep so it is more than enough for her. The stars on the step plates are a perfect touch.,4
3089,"Works well for a motorcycle helmet lock, just a little short",4
3090,The paper quality is good - just using it by itself with styluses provided. The bonus stencils are there just to get your attention as it absolutely useless with provided styluses. Overall positive experience,4
3091,"This book was a great read. Fun and hot! The romance between the two main characters was sweet. The authors hit all the feels. However, the tension was a bit lacking. They tried but it just didn't work for me. Will read more from the authors.",4
3092,its good but small tube,4
3093,My toddler grandsons seem to like them the only thing I wish it would have included in this set is like larger solid pieces that you could use for a base etc.,4
3094,"Crayola 12 count colored pencils hold up well to the pressure on the paper. The tip does not break easily and the colors are very vivid as expected with this brand. The downside is that the pencils are the standard size and not really great for young elementary and preschool age. A smaller (length pencil) would have been better. I don't feel like sharpening the pencil all the way down for each one, so it works well enough for now. This brand consistently makes good coloring items and this is no exception. I just think I would have spent a little more time researching the length of the pencil in the future. I was also surprised to find a two pack of colored pencils about the same price with prime as the one pack from a different seller.",4
3095,I purchased these as a gift for my mother. She LOVED them! Solved her problem with the earrings she loves to wear and they were Incredibly comfortable. You couldn‚Äôt see them either when she wore them.,4
3096,I use this to keep my cream fresh. It works and keeps the cream fresh for about 4-5 hours.,4
3097,Exactly as advertised.,4
3098,So after playing with this watch all day I have to say not bad. Not great but not bad. I don‚Äôt like the fact that you have to remove the wrist band to charge the watch. Also that when lift to see the time doesn‚Äôt always work. When you use the watch to take a picture with your phone it doesn‚Äôt show you what the camera sees. It locates your phone with sound but if you use your phone to find your watch the watch vibrates which is useless. The other functions are ok but are a little glitchy. In the end It‚Äôs a nice cheap alternative for a child who wants smart watch.,4
3099,"Bought these to use on the beach. They're nice for drinks and help keep them studier. However, they don't work for snacks because they're so low to the ground that there's no way that sand doesn't get kicked into them. I think they'd be useful for drinks for almost any outdoor venue to give a little extra spill protection, although they'll only work on a fairly flat surface. The plastic is quite thick and hard, so they seem very durable.",4
3100,"It keeps things cold very well. My issue is with the top, it gets dirty between the two layers of the slide drinking slide and there is no way to clean it. I‚Äôm looking for a leakproof top that You can wash. Mine looks pretty mildewed after 6 weeks. Cloudy and trapped dirt is in there",4
3101,As advertised. Product performed as described. Well built. Recommended,4
3102,The pans are great but they do not nest inside each other. I wish I had noticed the reviews that mentioned that before purchasing these.,4
3103,"quality is so so. The only thing I like is BPA free. For 36 pk, it's still a good deal.",4
3104,Liked the positive attitude.,4
3105,"I enjoyed that Alabama Moon was a ""clean"" movie that the family can watch. It moved along and kept my interest.",4
3106,Very pretty earrings. Kinda big for me personally as a prefer smaller-sized earrings but will probably give a pair to my niece since they're v.stylish.üëç,4
3107,works well but hard to peel off,4
3108,"The auger bit is find for my use. I needed to plant blubs around some trees. It was better than trying to dig with a spade. The ground is hard and some top roots. The best way to use, is to angle the bit a little and when drilling only go a small depth and pull the bit out. Do this several times until you get the depth you need.",4
3109,Works for lighter posters. Don't hang anything heavy.,4
3110,"Works great but door could be designed a little better. Really, would it cost that much more to put hinges on it?",4
3111,These cards are lovely! Nice quality paper and the gold foil is beautiful! The envelopes are white while the cards are cream/Ivory so my only wish is that the envelopes better matched the card color.,4
3112,"I needed something to hold my large collection of fashion jewelry that wasn't too obvious but let me see everything I have. I also wanted a full length mirror...and I found this! It was affordable, fit my needs and looks great. I mounted it on the wall but used a sturdier bracket underneath that doesn't show like the dinky brackets included with the cabinet. The mirror is huge, unlike the other cabinets I looked at that had little 10"" mirrors. The quality of mirror is good too, no distortion to speak of. Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend!",4
3113,"I bought this repair kit with intention of repairing my Gamecube controller, and was highly satisfied with the tools that came equipped. The tools not only work on Nintendo controllers, but Xbox as well. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking to replace their controller shell, buttons, or even just clean out their controller.",4
3114,My last popsocket was better than this one.. anytime my phone gets slightly warm the adhesive loosens and the darn thing falls off üòë,4
3115,I still need to adjust a bit to get NBC but I get all other channels very clearly. I'm very happy with this and wish I had gone with this years ago.,4
3116,"Really good for acne prone skin. It‚Äôs cleared up my face and kept it that way since 1st use. If it helps, my skin type is oily",4
3117,"These work well, attach strongly, and make it easier to hold my iPad without hurting my arthritic fingers. My only complaint is the too-bright color.",4
3118,This is a great story - it starts slow but worth the investment to stick with it. Lovely native stories woven together with the gritty realism of social ills and balancing tribal relationships is masterful.,4
3119,Haven't made any recipes yet. But it looks like a great cook book.,4
3120,"Product looks great. It's a much better solution than the clutter of numerous DVD cases. I marked it down one star because the cases are not self contained. It would be better if the binding portion of the ""book"" had a zipper to hold all the disks in.",4
3121,I loved that you can change the position of the branches and just simply how it looks in my living room . I would have give it a 5 star but I would loved it if the color of the light will be ‚Äúdaylight‚Äù instead of bright white. I know there are bulbs available in the market to change how I wanted the color to be but that would be too much $$.,4
3122,Very comfortable. love it,4
3123,The color looks very rich and the fabric feels good on the skin. Runs a little snug tho.,4
3124,"These are okay headphones, they are what I expected for the price so I'm happy with them.",4
3125,I never leave reviews but this is worth saying something. It‚Äôs veary soft and it did shed but it‚Äôs an easy fix.I would buy 2 maybe 3 sets to have a decent look .,4
3126,"Loved the case, expect the keyboard cover was brighter than shown in the description picture.",4
3127,Book is good for used conditions but keep in mind that these kinds of books won‚Äôt come with an access code which is needed in certain college courses.,4
3128,"Lost my old one for my Flex 4, so bought this one instead. Of course the day this arrives, I find the old one. *rolls eyes* Anyway, now I have a spare, I guess. It works fine.",4
3129,"I love this cup-keeps liquids cold for long periods of time even in a ""hot car"". Hot liquids stay HOT as well! The problem is the cap...it is so dang difficult to remove and the rubber seal moves around! My other North didn't have THIS problem! HELP",4
3130,"Liked the toothbrushes a lot, but it's early days so don't know yet if they will last at least 3 months. Can't use the finger toothbrushes with our dogs, but since we have three of them, wanted the three different colors. Will report back in 3 months.",4
3131,Can't turn off the unit the fast charger work perfect,4
3132,Got this for my great nieces and they loved it!,4
3133,"This band is nice and soft. It is much lighter than the original rubber band that came with my apple watch. It compares to the genuine apple nylon sport band, but is made cheaper. For the price, I really can't complain. However, one thing to mention is the threading isn't perfectly consistent and some threads may come loose if you aren't gentle with it.",4
3134,"Love the look of the case. Very minimal protection, but decent value for the price. I would recommend this case to someone who is not prone to phone abuse.",4
3135,Very good product for bugs,4
3136,"Put these in frames and hung them on my dining room wall. They look great-very classy and adds a nice pop of color to the wall. They shipped very quickly, and enclosed was a personalized note from the seller, which I thought was such a nice touch. Great pictures, highly recommend!",4
3137,I‚Äôve had a bottle of this soap under my sink for a long time. I couldn‚Äôt quite quit my Ajax habit. Finally decided to try it and now I‚Äôm hooked. I love the smell and I actually am using less per sink full. The only reason for the four stars is that it seems to dry my hands out a little more than I‚Äôd like.,4
3138,"Highly recommend , I can use the cord or go wireless .",4
3139,"I didn‚Äôt think this could work on my triple helix ear piercings, but I have to say, it does. I had been using sterile saline spray, and it seemed to be getting puffier and more irritated rather than better. I‚Äôve only been using this for a couple of days, and it already feels and looks much better. Much less puffy and irritated. Pretty pricey, but worth it, I think.",4
3140,Good product and fast delivery too.,4
3141,"Not bad, but very often you need to play with brightness, contrast and saturation of original picture, otherwise you will get either too bright or too dark print (depends on original pic). But I still like it and would recommend.",4
3142,This book was really well written . . . I liked this book a lot . . . . .,4
3143,"I have continuously repurchase this over and over. My only complaint is that the green tea is very very mild, I am quite sure the green tea inside this is very minimal but I like the other ingredients inside this, meaning the fiber, the probiotics, potassium. What I do is I mix two teaspoon of this matcha, with one teaspoon of pure ceremonial first grade matcha powder from other sellers, and blend this with half cup of low fat goat milk and one cup of water and a little monk fruit. I drink this after my dinner and its so yummy, it really fill me up leaving hardly room for me to snack and it makes me sleep so much better because of the L theanine.",4
3144,I ordered medium (typically I am a small) because I read the reviews that it ran small. I wish the tanks were a still little bigger.,4
3145,"While this was a nice size and everything fit. I didn't like that the handle was on the side and not the top, which meant I was basically carrying my makeup side ways. However, I was pleased with it when it first arrived. After a couple of weeks it was just not functional for me.",4
3146,The size was perfect! The quality is very good and held up during our very windy nights.,4
3147,This product is worth the purchase and does what it says. Perfect rice every time and very easy to operate (remember to hold your finger down for a second or so to get the proper feedback on the touch display). I'm giving it 4 stars because cleaning it isn't so simple. The pot that sits within the product is great. It's non-stick and easy to clean. My issue is with the lid that closes down to seal the rice/food. I've looked up how to remove and clean these components on YouTube and other sites without helpful results. Reading their instruction manual offers the most minimal assistance and is rather insulting. What I've had to do is wipe it clean with a rag on the counter with soap and then wipe the soap off with a clean rag over and over until it's clean. I'd prefer a removable top that can be washed in the dishwasher and was a little dumbfounded when I realized it didn't work that way considering the price compared to cheaper $20 units I've used from places like Target. If you purchase it you will see what I mean. If I'm wrong and there is a way then I still blame the manufacturer for not making it more obvious.,4
3148,Hmm end up needing both hands to squeeze. I thought would be easier because of the design.,4
3149,"Awesome case protects phone like it should , just need screen protector.",4
3150,"My only complaint is that without drilling the extra two bottom holes into my vehicle, the covers are not as sturdy and secure. If I was willing to drill holes into my metal bumper, then these would be perfect.",4
3151,Great looking but the fabric is stiff and somewhat harsh feeling to lay on.,4
3152,"Have yet to decide where to put them, but love the different design. They came in the box with the five corner shelves. Now I have to decide which way up I want them. I like them very much",4
3153,For my son worked great,4
3154,The glasses are of good quality. I like them because they are anti-glare. They are definitely better than what you could buy at your local store. I can't find any cons with them at this time.,4
3155,4 only because they started to shrink after the first wash,4
3156,Wish the lenses were a bit darker.,4
3157,Would have 5 stars because everything is great except the screen protector cracked the first day I applied it and I never even dropped my phone,4
3158,"I had two reasons to love Being Brooke. I like watching best friends fall in love! My daughter and I represent two generations of women who married their best friends.; and my granddaughter just announced that she and her best friend are starting to date! My last name is Barker(a name given to me by my late husband). I nearly gave up on this book because this Brooke was broken. She wasn't quirky, she was just queer! The only thing I could work out about her was on the autism spectrum. That's understandable! Crazy for no reason is not!",4
3159,Great color of dark brown. It was just what I needed for my dark chocolate brown leather couch.,4
3160,"For the price, this is a great deal. I'm a little nervous about reviews saying the turntable stopped working - Hoping I won't need to use it for long, as my intent is to transfer all vinyl and cassettes to my computer. If you want to hook up speakers to the unit, you'll need to use speakers that connect via the headphone jack - most computer speaker sets would work.",4
3161,"I like the case, it works well. I wish it came in purple. The only complaint I have is that it doesn‚Äôt charge well on the cordless charger.",4
3162,"Good quality but runs very small. I‚Äôm usually a medium or large, purchase an xl for comfort and it barely fits. The quality of the shirt is nice though.",4
3163,I love them so much I where are them every day,4
3164,"Would have rated it 5 stars, but the storage doesn't lock or stay closed at all",4
3165,"What a sweet and fun story. I loved that they were born th normal people. Single parents, living comfortably, adults...Loved it!",4
3166,"My case finally delivered today, and I love it. I‚Äôve purchased multiple cases, but had to return them the same day as they retained so much water. This case is perfect. The review gets only 4 stars because it‚Äôs says this item is black, so other may purchase and be upset about it. The case is space gray. It was perfect for me as my watch is Space gray.",4
3167,Sounds great looks amazing just wish it came in a proper sleeve with album art instead of the clear plastic sleeve,4
3168,"I had purchased one about a year ago, liked it now I purchased two more.",4
3169,I have not noticed improvement in the teeth after taking product for several months. Maybe I am not taking enough. I take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 in the evening. It is kind of expensive to take more than that and it does have a fishy taste while in my mouth. I usually don't taste it after I have swallowed it.,4
3170,Great to keep passwords organized. Would be better set up alphabetically.,4
3171,"Still waiting for results it hasn‚Äôt been 6 weeks yet, but will order more",4
3172,Significantly improves grip and one handed operation of my phone,4
3173,". Fit my 2018 Accord pretty good the back part of the seat isnt fully covered completely but most is, Came a bit wrinkled but not to bad, material is actually good quality",4
3174,"This product is quite sturdy (metal not plastic). Easily installed. However the flow restriction is more like 70%. Using a 1/16 inch drill bit, I drilled a hole in the center of the perforated plastic insert. That increased the flow but not to rinse the shampoo from my wife's hair. Through measured process I ended up drilling 2 additional holes (12 and 6 o'clock) for a total of 3. Just like Goldilocks I got it ""just right.""",4
3175,Definitely a better look on the vehicle but I have noticed a significant drop of radio signal. I use the USB and Aux mainly so this isn't a major issue for me,4
3176,"good stuff, butt you upped the price by 25%, time to go to home depot.",4
3177,"Its a beautiful top but I had to return the medium to get a large. the fit was fine except for the hip area. If you have hips, order a size up from your usual, otherwise it won't hang right on you.",4
3178,"I like the product but can't speak to effectiveness yet, price could be low based on the amount of product.",4
3179,"The tin size is very small, I expected it to be more like an altoids container. However, it is still a cute product that my son will love, and it did arrive a day ahead of schedule.",4
3180,"the side buttons for browser forward and back movement are mushy and not easy to know you've pushed them until something happens on the screen. Otherwise nice mouse, if a tad overpriced at the time of purchase.",4
3181,very light but it works!,4
3182,The product was bigger then expected but it works as it should. I'm very happy with it,4
3183,"I enjoyed this mystery from the first page. The characters were a bit weird, and I loved the idea of old women playing detective.",4
3184,Enjoy this series but found the newlyweds to be highly annoying in this book.,4
3185,Good quality - stripped speaker wire and it came out real clean. I had an old stripper that just wouldn't do the trick anymore - good replacement. Seems to be well made,4
3186,too much political talk,4
3187,"Cute, fun, feel good movie. Yep, worth your time.",4
3188,Great product! Easy to install and stays where you put it. Protects the leather seats from scratches from my two dogs. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a few inches short of covering the entire rear seat in my full size crew cab pickup. I'd definitely pay a few dollars more for an extra large size. Should be no problem in most cars!,4
3189,"I liked the price, color, fit, adjustable option & quality of the hat. I did not want a floppy beach hat, nor a dressy looking one & this one is great for everyday use & will go with whatever you're wearing.",4
3190,"I wanted to try this and love it, it wasn‚Äôt really the best for me since my skin is super sensitive, you should definitely give it a try, the price is reasonable, the smell isn‚Äôt strong or overwhelming and the formula is pretty lightweight.",4
3191,Little smaller than anticipated but quality seems good,4
3192,"I measured my dogs necks so I could buy the correct size- they were 10 inches exact. Technically the XS was their correct size, but it would have been super tight.",4
3193,Getting a solution to increasing your energy can be achieved on this diet. This is a step by step guide to preparing a delicious meal. i like these recipes and am sure to deliver this book to my sibling for a quick start on the diet,4
3194,Very cute and fast delivery,4
3195,"Pros: -Didn't leak. -Low chance of toxic shock. -You can wear it in preparation without any adverse side effects. Cons: -Uncomfortable if inserted incorrectly. -Super hard for me to break the suction and take out. I really want it to work for me, so I'm planning on trying it out again next time. All the reviews I've read have said how comfortable it is and convenient too! Hopefully I can get the hang of it soon!",4
3196,"It's functional but I wish there were some drivers to map the buttons and adjust sensitive more. also, id' prefer that the illumination could be user adjusted. I just use it as a back up mouse, so it does what it needs to do.",4
3197,"Everything was as excepted and delivery was very fast. I love this charger! Exactly what I was looking for, exactly what I needed! I loved it so much that I ordered another one for my son.",4
3198,"The pencils lay down nicely and have nice vibrant colors as well as a nice range of colors. However I had a problem with them breaking a lot during sharpening, but I have found that the KUM brand sharpener works pretty well on these pencils lessening the problem. Now that I have figured out the issue with sharpening I will buy these again.",4
3199,"As far as excellent tracking response I give it 5 stars, only took off 1 star because it's really cold since it's metal, but it's very handy to use when I'm on the couch or in bed watching movies. If I'm needing it for games involving track speed I use it. Might be due to my using the heater sparingly. It also has a good padded backing so no need to worry about scratching any surfaces.",4
3200,"It fits decent. It did not seem to fit to great at first but now that it is broken in -- it is good to go. My problem with the case could have been operator error. I think several people said good things, about my plastic wood grain looking laptop case. I'd recommend it. Make sure you order the right size and model. :)",4
3201,"I will definitely be reading more of this author. I enjoyed the plot, the character development and the introduction of the secondary characters. I look forward to the next in the series.",4
3202,I love that they stick to my shoe even after i remove and reset a few times. I have been going to physio therapy for my heel pain and it helps for a few days that gradually returns. She recommended arch supports and I am wowed. I did not expect such fast relief. They pack of six was perfect for 3 shoes that I wear most. I am feeling so much better.,4
3203,I purchased this item in order to cut back on the usage of plastic bottles. Perhaps not the best water filter on the market but I think it does a great job and I see no major difference between bottled water and water from this product.,4
3204,I used this to color a flame for my chemistry class. It worked fine and was delivered as expected.,4
3205,I ordered these because I have ordered this type of cable from this seller in the past. The cables are durable and flexible. They are exactly as described. Unfortunately on this order I was send 2 USB C and 1 Micro USB instead of 3 USB C. It's no big deal and mistakes happen. I processed a return through Amazon and it was corrected in no time.,4
3206,I am very pleased with this product. Exactly what we wanted for our dog. Very happy with our purchase,4
3207,I purchased this clock for my sewing room. It looks great! I think the price point is high for the size of clock.,4
3208,Only reason I gave a four is because putting a wrist strap on the same end as the electrodes makes no sense. If you make contact with a person or animal they can get caught up in the flapping wrist strap and you lose your weapon. I suggest they make a removable strap for the opposite end for when you only want to carry this stick as protection and can sling it over your shoulder.,4
3209,"Used them once so far. Have never used Cast Iron before, so we are still learning.",4
3210,"Tasted very good for a vitamin. However, did not see any difference in hair growth.",4
3211,Loved the color but the flowers aren‚Äôt in the same place as pictured. Didn‚Äôt like the huge rose in the front/at mid-chest,4
3212,Goddaughter enjoyed it.,4
3213,Just okay but fits decently,4
3214,Couldn't put this one down. Love scary stories & can't wait to read the next one!,4
3215,"I just love this case! It's very feminine. The reason for four stars is because the built in screen protector is awful! Made my phone look vintage. I already have a glass screen protector installed, so I put the case in the dryer and melted the glue and pulled the screen protector off. Now it's petfect! This will do until my custom case comes in!",4
3216,"I'm a novice and bought this as my 2nd paddle; seeing it as an upgrade from my first one. This Titan paddle feels a little heavier than my Ping Pong brand paddle and it looks better. The handle is nicely finished compared to my first paddle that had some rough spots I had to sand down. The rubber on the Titan is sticky and very grippy BUT my starter paddle seems pretty sticky too. In all, the paddle seems to be a good value. Time will tell. Before I move up to a paddle in the $50 - $100 range I will try one out to see if it makes that much difference in my game compared to how I play with the Titan.",4
3217,Minor inconsistencies but perfect for my use,4
3218,I like the notebook so I'm giving it as a gift . Thank you.,4
3219,Does the job and one of the only I could find for grandson's LG Rebel,4
3220,"Very comfortable, although the material is a little stiffer than I had expected. I marked ""fit as expected"" but I purposely ordered one size below what I would normally wear. It's a bit snug, but I'm happy.",4
3221,"This is the story of a police night patrol featuring two (partners) officers. It is realistic and interesting -- depicts what officers do most of the time, and this makes it different. The novel is not a thriller nor a mystery, per se, more the routine of a night patrol. There is a human element as the reader sees into the lives and minds of the featured officers. As can be expected, there is much banter and interaction between officers and with those they arrest. This is a standalone novel; however, it is basically an introduction to the series. Reviewed by the author of The Children's Story, About Good and Evil.",4
3222,Nice toys but some are low in quality . The surface was rough,4
3223,It was a good model.,4
3224,These puffs come in their own little container making it easy to store. I use it to apply cc cream and it does a good job. It takes a bit to clean them and I find I need to use some rubbing alcohol to get it real clean.,4
3225,works ok just a little bigger than I had anticipated,4
3226,Great read! I bought the book on my kindle on Thursday and by Sunday I was finished. The book was great.,4
3227,Product has too many requirements to work properly. But I‚Äôd recommend you buy and stay in contact with the seller because they‚Äôll help you with any issues you may have.,4
3228,"Runs small, cute 2 piece.",4
3229,"I like the personality descriptions of the characters, but it moved a little too slowly",4
3230,were is my free downloader app for my fire stick I never download it is not working without it having to many problems,4
3231,"Put these under my kitchen cabinets. Hardly any hiccups for this DIYer. Bought the extension wire, 90 degree clips, and connector pieces, these were just OK. Nexlux could have a better description of what other pieces are required to do things like connect the lights to the extension wire and then reconnect after running behind cabinets and into a soffit etc. That part was tedious and cost them a star.",4
3232,"Its good, does the job but a bit too thin. You need to be gentle otherwise it will tear. If its a critical job, dryer vent for example, you will need to double or triple it. 3M Heavy Duty is still the best though, so if quality is more important to you than cost, then thats the way to go. For every day jobs, regular duct work, this is fine.",4
3233,"the taste was good. however when I received it, the packages were melted. I put them in the freezer and broke hem apart as I ate them. will not order them again for this reason",4
3234,I‚Äôve used the eye mask twice so far. No issues with them staying in place. I‚Äôve already started to notice a difference in my eyes.,4
3235,"Nice little case, I didn't want to spend more at this time, this is not the leather feel I would prefer but it performs the purpose of protecting my kindle admirably! I also find it attractive with a design in the leather. Certainly a good product for the price.",4
3236,Just what I needed. Finding these was like Goldilocks finding the porridge that was 'just right'.,4
3237,Works good in the car,4
3238,"Very durable case, now I would let my toddler use the ipad.",4
3239,"Better quality than I actually expected. Good amount of compression. I'm a nurse working 12 hour shifts, they have been nice to have. I only marked them down because the threads from the all over patterns leave marks on my legs.",4
3240,Fairly good set. The only issue I have is the seam is really pronounced.,4
3241,"I enjoyed the mystery in the story. I wavered a lot between the main character being nice, a ditz and just stupid with some of the things she was doing all with knowing someone killed her friend, was after her brother and trying to kill her. Even if she wasn't worried about herself, you would think it more important to solve the murder and send things than to endanger herself and others. I got this book for free and am voluntarily giving a review.",4
3242,"Works great. You will need to get past the initial chlorine smell, as it dissipates. Use in the am for cpap equipment. No smell in the evening. The spray lock/unlock is counter intuitive, never seen this style before. Can be difficult to unlock.",4
3243,"I really like this car seat for my puppy, he stays safe, while I drive.",4
3244,"This thing really works to lessen the impacts. Definitely makes a hard tail bike ride much nicer. It is well made, except that there is a little more play in the bushings that I think is needed. As a result, the seat can actually rock side to side a little. This does not bother me at all when riding, and may actually be a benefit, but I worry that it will get worse as it wears. Regardless, what this seat post does is transform your hard tail bike into something you‚Äôll will want to ride more, and it makes the bike more capable. I currently have it on a fat bike. I have another good full suspension trail bike, but I doubt that I‚Äôll buy another FS bike, ‚Äòcause you can get a hard tail and still have comfort if equipped with this post.",4
3245,"Nice product, good quality which means a good purchase. Thank you.",4
3246,"These actually work pretty darn good. Yiu can build it up, higher, or keep it short. And the cross braces add rigid and sturdy. I wish they had different size (length) cross braces, as the ones come with make you build it a certain size,because they are fixed length. It makes a kind of triangle structure about 12 inches each side.",4
3247,"I got these for my 4 year old so she can transition to using ""big girl"" cups before she starts pre-k this August. They are the perfect size and great for kids just starting to drink from cups without a lid.",4
3248,"Bought this for the table for our Halloween party. Cute, pretty durable, and as pictured.",4
3249,"bought this for a Vegas trip, it was beautiful and fit well, but I didn't quite realize HOW low the v-neck was. Tried using garment tape but couldnt get it to hold--if you have a way to keep it strapped down, then I say give this one a try. I'm sad I didn't get to show it off on my trip",4
3250,Its as good as they say it is.,4
3251,Fit great. Only had one pillow case. Expected two. Had a funny industrial order when out of the box but was fine after washed and dried.,4
3252,Great especially for kids. Why pay full price for a name brand with all the bells and whistles you get here with a MUCH better price!,4
3253,My quakers love this. I can hear how they played with this little spoons. Quality is pretty good because usually my quakers destroys any toy in like a month but this one still good and look that may hang for a while.,4
3254,I like that the case also came with a screen protector and the case is durable but isn't bulky.,4
3255,I ordered this charge so I can keep this in my work bag for my laptop on the go. Good value and great price for the extra charger to have on hand!,4
3256,Not super sturdy but does the trick,4
3257,"Excellent price for the same mill thickness sold in big box stores. Came in very handy covering a large floor area, drywall job.",4
3258,Love this dress but it's more of a bathing suit cover up because the dress part is completely see-through,4
3259,This will be a gift for a family member. It smells nice !,4
3260,Gave as a gift and the person loved it. Plus they had to wear a full leg brace and didn't want to put on socks so this worked perfectly.,4
3261,Love the characters And the overlap into other myths And legends. These are well written great make you want more. Thanks,4
3262,Love how realistic they look.,4
3263,"I like the size a lot and that it is waterproof so in Windy NYC, I do not need to carry an umbrella, just a raincoat and the purse. My only issue is I do not like the interior zipper compartment. It is not needed. There are enough other zipper compartments in the purse.",4
3264,A bit too detailed for me but interesting enough theories about how things could be to keep me going. This is a case of saving the human race against overwhelming odds.,4
3265,Good deal for 4 mouth guards! Somewhat tricky to form. Good quality. I would purchase again. Not that I need it anytime soon.,4
3266,"Feels great, love the high top, I wish I could pull it up better from the back",4
3267,The product works as indicated but NOT as good as it described. I expected more for the price charged.,4
3268,"This product is great, but the instructions suck... also, it took me and my brother over an hour to figure out why the Power Magic Pro wasn't working. We located the correct fuses, checked them with a multi-meter and everything. Still, nothing. Turned out, the grounding screw in my car wasn't good. We had to find another one. Also, you have to charge the Power Magic Pro a little bit to get it going. I recommend turning on the engine to jump start it and then try to see if it works in parking mode when you turn the car off. Other than that, this product is awesome! The images are extremely clear. The cloud feature to be able to live stream is awesome! I highly recommend this product!",4
3269,"Just got these so can't say much for durability, but like several reviewers said they're just a hair smaller left and right than the screen of my S6. Still debating of I'll keep it.",4
3270,you can wireless charge through this case.,4
3271,I love the top so flattering and sexy. My one criticism would be I wish the material was thicker. Because it‚Äôs thin I have to wear a strapless bra wish I don‚Äôt really need but too revealing otherwise. I wore last night tho and got tons of compliments!,4
3272,I just laid them into an empty drawer as my furniture has yet to arrive. They fit tight and are adjustable so I think they will be perfect.,4
3273,"Use it to hold my ipad on counter when cooking, closing it shuts off the unit, gives good protection to unit (know its coffee proof :))",4
3274,"I like this, and wish it had fit me, It didn't but a friend I showed it to loved it and it fit her, it was close to her birthday , so a perfect birthday gift!",4
3275,"The only thing I didn't like was the delivery time, It actually took 3 weeks, but the product is great. A great looking product for the cost.",4
3276,Another great Louise Penny read. I am hoping she will continue the series but I understand if she doesn't continue..,4
3277,"This was a great replacement for the bottom of our couch, but it was slightly too small to cover the bottom, so we tried to use three pieces to cover the entire bottom of the couch (to cover the holes our cats made) they, of course, found the seams between the layers and tore it out again. Would recommend if bottom of couch/chair is small enough to cover with a single piece of fabric. Was really easy to unfold/install (we used a staple gun to attach). Would order again if a larger width is available.",4
3278,"Some fit really well, others are too loose.",4
3279,"Pinches between ring and tube, extremely painful. Love that the end comes off, makes for great teasing and good cleaning.",4
3280,Love the color-teal.. When you wash it has a TONS of lint. Once dried looks great. Love that it is 100% cotton. I'm hoping the next wash will not have alot of lint.,4
3281,"X box is awesome , but I‚Äôm a little worried about the delivery. The box was set on my front porch this is a $300 plus order and it was also marked handed directly to me , no it was not !!!! I had a small panic attack when my Alexa notified me that it was handed to resident. I ran outside and it was on my side walk üòî",4
3282,"Great price for this type of watch band. Fairly thin, but works as expected with a good magnetic closure.",4
3283,Loved the product but the delivery person LIED about handing the package to a person. They layed it next to my door,4
3284,Super nice product my large cat can not fit in the side basket or top bed but the cat tree is very nice.,4
3285,Well made and simple pans.,4
3286,"I liked the plot of Pulse and the author‚Äôs choice to focus on an underrepresented segment of our population in this book. The only criticism I have is that I guessed one of the villains when introduced, and I‚Äôm usually completely unable to do that. Still, the book is a great, enjoyable read for those who enjoy murder mysteries.",4
3287,This is a great product and I‚Äôm sure it will hold up. The only thing o would change is a more secure magnet as mine have come loose several times. I would also like to see one more card pocket. I believe the photo showed more than 2.,4
3288,Does not come with instructions on how to install. They would be nice. Especially since you need the front lights..had to go to YouTube to install this. Instructions would help alot...,4
3289,"Nice case, huge capacity. Could use more micro item configurations/pockets. Would be nice if it had the rubber bumpers on bottom for when its resting on ground and to help stabilize. Otherwise very nice",4
3290,"Love this dress! Wedding, school, it is perfect for any situation with the right accessories! The fabric is a bit sheer when stretched, but its soft and comfy!",4
3291,"Accurate, Fits well, Good quality, fast shipping, good price, Great seller!",4
3292,I love the wallet. Works almost as expected. Cards can not be inserted fully or they get stuck in switching than unable to remove cards easily. Other than that issue the wallet is great. I leave my cards inserted only 3/4 in to prevent issues.,4
3293,Fragrance smells good. But it's really strong.,4
3294,"The items were very soft, easy to launder, and I was very satisfied",4
3295,My handy guy had a heck of a time with this thing. He said he had never seen one so difficult to attach. He gave up on the lag bolts. Very study once you figure it out though. The water heater is the only thing that will survive the earthquake.,4
3296,"Way too small, go a size up when purchasing, other than that, they're great",4
3297,have not tried yet will let you know at another time,4
3298,Enjoyed the way this mystery unfolded. Based in Canada about a frozen corpse found on along a USA roadway. Hunter an ex detective turned truck driver is thrown into the middle of this investigation to help out his fellow truckers.,4
3299,"What I was looking for: something to clip onto the existing car visor to significantly increase the area protecting my eyes while driving into sun rise or sun down. What this product is: a very well-made, tinted plastic (?) visor that clips onto the existing visor, then existing visor is folded down out of the way, leaving this product to do the job. However it didn‚Äôt work for me. The morning glare was still shining from all directions not specifically covered by this visor and still blinding me.",4
3300,This case is very attractive. It holds and secures my phone nicely. I love the way it looks. Very classy. I have a black j7 so this case matches it perfectly. The downsides are the inside card holder. It's a very delicate mesh that rips easily resulting in cards falling out when using the phone not good ! so you have to be very careful not to overload and rip the sides. The magnet could be more magnetic it doesn't hold the case closed very well. The strap is very thin I had a sturdier black strap that I use on it instead of the one that comes with it. I am on my second one and although they do not hold up too long i like the look and the fact its not heavy. My first case lasted about 3 months before it ripped and looked a little worn around the corners.,4
3301,Looks good. I wish it were just a little deeper. It will be useful.,4
3302,"This book includes a quick trip to making hydroponics a part of saving us trips to the market to buy raw foods like fruits and vegetables. There are a few options you can make when it comes to your hydroponic system, but many times the roots of your plants will be suspended in, misted with, or flooded with a nutrient solution (you can design the nutrient system to meet the needs of your chosen plants), so that the plants still get everything they need. And that's just enough for me. So thanks! The book is very good.",4
3303,Now this smells like the barber shop of old. Refreshing to have thoughts of a simpler time after you shave.,4
3304,Will use at night. Really like the unit but sound control is to touchy,4
3305,"Seriously, go to walMart, and you will get a better deal. Not nearly as good as I had hoped but it's sturdy",4
3306,Theses beauties are unique and made well. Only con it that they turn my ankles and ugly black.,4
3307,"Easy to set up smarthome plug. Doubles your outlet space without blocking the second socket. Each socket has a manual control as well as smarthome control. Not for 5G connections, which is a shame, but works well & has indicator lights around the manual buttons. Will be using this for in-demand countertop sockets.",4
3308,"Bought for Samsung 11.6 Chromebook 3. VERY nice! Much thinner than I even expected it to be, which is good. I do wish it adhered to the keys/board a little better but overall, when typing etc.. It does NOT move around or slip. It's also thin enough that it doesn't prevent it from closing all the way. Great crumb catcher for my 10 year old!",4
3309,"This purchase is a gift for someone that has been unopened so my review is based on my experiences with the product. My first issue in this experience is pricing. From this listing it costs about store price (still too much), but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason. It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates. This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys. I'm sure this young kid will have fun with it, but all factors included it isn't worth returning and also not worth rebuying.",4
3310,"I received it promptly, washed it and started using it. I like the taste of the water. The digital meter worked for a day and stopped turning on. I guess this happens. I don‚Äôt really need it to work but st least the water is good.",4
3311,"I wanted a soap dispenser that didn't take up much room for our bathrooms. This works pretty well, although the pump is a little weak for gel soap. One pump didn't seem strong enough to work at all, but fortunately, there was an extra, and also it's a standard size, so I could use one from an old dispenser for one of them. In some ways, I like this better, as not too much comes out at a time, and so far, it's been reliable.",4
3312,A very informative book to read. I would highly recommend it to those who is just starting. Give this book to all high school senior students!,4
3313,"Includes so many items, perfect for road trips",4
3314,"This is a great item to keep your dog from getting wet. A little hard to connect to your dogs collar without the dog getting a little anxious. The chain to attach to the collar is about 12"" so trying to connect it with the umbrella tapping the dog is a little difficult. However once I attached it my dog walked fine. It definitely kept her dry. My dog is a poodle/terrier and weighs about 15 ibs.",4
3315,Bought for grandbaby! Loves it!,4
3316,I love it. Few things I don't love is it's not as detailed as I thought it would be and the metal is not as strong and bends easily. Also wish there were two clasps on the back instead of just one so it'll stay on my vest without spinning.,4
3317,"Inexpensive, it works for my cat.",4
3318,They work great but you. Can‚Äôt plug anything else into the outlet because it takes up the whole thing and covers the lower one. Other than that it‚Äôs great. I have three of them in my room and use one remote.,4
3319,Serves the purpose of what I needed this for. I just bought it to hold a set of drapes in a doorway. Just wish it had better staying tension because If you pull the drapes too hard you may pull the pole down too.,4
3320,"It is OK, could be a little brighter.",4
3321,Purchased it for my work phone. Only think I don't like are the flaps that cover the charging port. Makes it hard to get too and very annoying when you want to charge. But I just cut them off and I am happy now.,4
3322,The dress is beautiful. The size I order was a little laser for me so go for one smaller size,4
3323,"Bought this item for my 5 yr old son and he loves it, makes him feel like a big boy. Makes homework time go by a lot quicker since all his supplies are in one place.",4
3324,Smaller than expected.. it‚Äôs also lightweight too and keeps falling off my baby. Keeping it though cuz it‚Äôs still cute.,4
3325,They run small. Order a size up. I'm a small and I should've gotten a medium.,4
3326,Fit ears good. One of the cushions on the ear pieces fell off,4
3327,Such a cute pair of sunglasses!! Thank you so much!,4
3328,I purchased the three in a series and have not been disappointed. Great cozy reading.,4
3329,Top is very comfortable bottom is too loose.,4
3330,It does the job well.,4
3331,It looks great. Good quality. Only thing is the team names arent attached on the plate itself. It is 2 plastic plates glued to the metal frame. So word of advice. Is to put super glue on edges of team names. And that should hold longer.,4
3332,The product was bought for my brother. So far so good! Trust me if there was something not right he would let me know. So for now 4 stars. Maybe will update as more time passes.,4
3333,"Solid product....I expected it to be a little more quiet.....still not too bad. Have cooked several steaks and chicken breast in it....you will have the most tender and juiciest chicken you've ever had....just, WOW! Well worth the money, still tinkering with the temps, but so far so good",4
3334,"I was surprised it actually taste like chocolate, and not a bad chocolate. My toddlers ate it like a candy and so did my husband and I.",4
3335,"Nice quality but the handle sometimes gets loose, but all you have to do is tighten the screw. No biggie.",4
3336,The material was VERY thin however so I will probably use as Long Johns,4
3337,"I installed this as a courtesy dome light in my 2002 Ford Ranger XLT. The length was spot on perfect, but the girth of the cylindrical metal connectors was less than I had hoped. I had to use pliers to compress the metal tabs on my dome light to get a tighter fit. It's in there good now and this light looks and functions great.",4
3338,I haven't quite finished but it's a good read.,4
3339,All together good product. Could use some elastic around the leg holes to hold in leaks. Sizing chart was accurate. Put on a 16 week old Boston Terrier. Will leak if he unleashes his full bladder.,4
3340,Kind cheap but do the job,4
3341,"After searching for some comfortable office shoes for awhile I came across this one. I was hesitant to purchase but it looked like it would work. The first few days weren‚Äôt that comfortable because i was still breaking into the shoes. I got a blister the first few days. However, once I finally broke into the shoes I would definitely say it was worth the price. It‚Äôs comfortable when walking for a long time, looks well with most of my office outfits and very light! I have enjoyed these shoes thus far.",4
3342,Just what I need to get telemetry from my Frsky receiver to the F4 flight controller.,4
3343,"I've purchased black seed oil pills from multiple companies and I cannot be without them. When it was time to repurchase I chose this brand based off the added ingredients (honey). When I received the product I liked the dark color and I noticed the ""dark residue"" in each capsule. After doing my research, I found that quality black seed oil (unrefined) should have this residue. So far this product is standing up to quality.",4
3344,Very cute and squishy. The heads rip easily but they are fun to play with.,4
3345,"Good quality, and have the coating over the stones which is great. But my gosh are they a pain to twist apart at first. Bought a size 0, fits perfect.",4
3346,"decent acting, script and direction.. and not too much gratuitous sex. i liked it and would even watch again :)",4
3347,"Liked the storyline,but not the length of the story. Wanted to know if she can have a child or not.",4
3348,These run big. If you want them to go under jeans or other pants then you need to go down a size. If you're wearing them as pj bottoms or just on their own then get them true to size for a comfy loose fit.,4
3349,Very good brand holistic dog food Benny loves it better than Blue Buffalo,4
3350,"It doesn‚Äôt really flatten my hair the way I like it to be, but it does remove the curls and gives great volume.",4
3351,This was extremely easy to use which was something that I was worried about when it came to purchasing it. I didn't want something overly complicated and hard to clean since that seems to be the common theme with these types of products. I was able to crush the garlic without a problem and it moved along with the crusher piece. The silicone was also extremely easy to clean so I am overall pleased and happy with the purchase. If you don't want something overly complicated or hard to clean then this can be an affordable option to go with. Everyone is always looking for items that make cooking easier and this is where you can find it! I love my garlic press and will definitely check into the other kitchen items from this company because I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and product. I did however have a bit of confusion in the beginning because the instructions were not clear so I googled. You guys might have to google too if you've never used a garlic press before.,4
3352,"I like this tennis trainer because it‚Äôs got a bigger base that you‚Äôre able to put more weight in. The bottom is also nice and flat so it doesn‚Äôt rip over easily. The ball was easy to attach to the string. My kids had a great time with this, getting some practice in.",4
3353,"Whenever we take our switch anywhere we use this. it's nice and compact, protects the system, and carries all of our games. It's super handy. Unfortunately it doesn't have any spare space at all, so if you want to bring extra joycons or pro controllers you're on your own.",4
3354,Bought the carpet to match my paw print classroom theme! It is super cute but it did come with a stain on it so that is the reason for a 4 star review. I am hopeful it will hold up with my kindergartners!,4
3355,"My picky kitty isn't a fan of much that is intended for her. I don't know if this actually helps with heat, but she has seemed to gravitate towards it this winter. Perhaps it is just the ""plastic bag"" sound that it makes, but if it makes her happy, for this price, I'll take it.",4
3356,"Wheel fit perfect on my Road King... Decent finish... Was worried about handling capabilities from the 21"" I like the way it rides better than stock at least for me.",4
3357,I love this holder. The brushes are not super durable so they need replacement,4
3358,Not very user friendly.,4
3359,"Who doesn‚Äôt love a cozy mystery including a bakery, that is till a murder. Nice touch of getting to know the sisters,and what they are up against. Plot flow, good description, and easy to read.",4
3360,"Overall this is an amazing book! Only lost one star due to poor packaging, but besides a few bent and out of place pages this was great!",4
3361,"All 4 cables are working fine. Charged Iphone 5s, 6s and Ipod. 6 feet cable is long enough. worth money.",4
3362,It fulfills my needs. I just wish it would have come in black. It does not come with a charger nor short cords but it does come with velcro straps so that you can contain longer cords inside the station if you don't want to spend the money on short cords.,4
3363,Works as AD. Not fast as new model but fast enough. Price for 2TB SSD is good enough,4
3364,"I have mixed thoughts on this skirt. For 1- I‚Äôm usually a small, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and roughly 120 pounds, but I had to order an XL to fit me (and it‚Äôs still a smidge tight) but still wearable. The color seemed brighter to me than displayed in the pictures. I ordered a burgundy and it still is burgundy but looks more red than I would have liked, maybe that‚Äôs just personal preference. Also kinda see- through. You can‚Äôt see underwear lines or anything but you can clearly see leg imprints right through the dress. It‚Äôs jusy an OK skirt to me. Not bad, but not excellent. Great for less dressy occasion- festivals or beaches, etc.",4
3365,"It's easy to use, has a slight scent that evaporates as it dries. So far this has been the best for my small one. His previous owner recommend this and I will forever be thankful.",4
3366,"Cook delicious, healthy and easy to prepare straight from my kitchen. This book all foods very good take this book you can weight loss easily.You can improve self-confidence day by day.",4
3367,This product works great except for one thing. I have to get within 20 ft. of the thermometer to get the Bluetooth to connect. This works for me though because my greenhouse is very close to my house and I don't have to actually go outside to read it. But I only have one spot in the house to connect... I have only had this product for a short time so I'm not sure about the battery life yet.,4
3368,great to have on vinyl.... wish they'd reissue CORE!!!!,4
3369,"My fianc√©e loves his ring. Its great for the price, but it changed from rose gold to yellow gold in a matter of weeks. Kinda sad because we got it to math my rose gold ring. But still, it‚Äôs a nice weight, and very durable. Would recommend but not if you‚Äôre looking for a rose gold ring.",4
3370,"I wish they were a little taller and that I had gotten them at the beginnings of the growing season. They were already up and had bloomed by the time I order the cage and had some difficulty putting the stalks through them. However, next year should not be a problem as they are in place before they grow back.",4
3371,Beautiful but the seems split in the fingers after an hour of wearing at a cocktail party.,4
3372,"These are very reasonably priced, and while they aren't an especially convincing wood texture when you look at them up close, they do look a lot classier than basic white plastic blinds. I ordered one to see how it looked and now that know they're alright I'm ordering more for some of the other windows in my house. I did knock off a star because the instructions are really annoyingly unclear and while mine are stable and working fine I'm still not sure I installed them exactly as intended. If you've never put up blinds before I'd recommend finding a tutorial on youtube or something, that's what I resorted to after the first 20 minutes of scratching my head.",4
3373,You may need to cut it to the size you need but it's easy to do.,4
3374,Small is to large for twin XL,4
3375,"This product is great for the price, it does what I needed which is add USB space. A neat feature is the light added to the USB hub and it changes colors about every 3-4 seconds.",4
3376,cute but a little pricey wish it came in different quantities,4
3377,These tongs work great. You can tell they are very good quality. Make it easy on your guests to hold plate in one hand and pick food up with the hand. Only reason I gave 4 star is I think the handles need to be rounded more.,4
3378,"I love what this is, but... I placed the stand on a white dresser and it stained it. Then I tried to get it off and no luck. Great size though",4
3379,"The cord is fairly substantial - long and heavy duty - more than you generally need if you have an accessible outlet, so this isn't for traveling light. But I used it every night on my trip and was able to charge multiple things at once which was very nice.",4
3380,Overall seems sturdy. Didnt like that there was just on them...,4
3381,Great value for a comfort shoe,4
3382,"I am using this product because my sister in law suffers from seizures, an since she is taking the drops the seizures have decreased.",4
3383,Like the product just fine. Easy to get one napkin at a time. Design is nice.,4
3384,Started using this light for my newly propagated succulent leaves. Seems perfect for those spaces that you want plants but don't get much sun. After a week so far the succulents seem happy.,4
3385,"these are great for the price but not sure how long they will last. they seem more cheaply made than store brand, but it is nice that you get 2 for the price of one",4
3386,"These bags are exactly what I was looking for when trying to find bags to carry supplies to and from school. What I did not realize is that one of them is a little skinnier than the others, but overall they work great!",4
3387,Grandson really into Disney cars and enjoys these.,4
3388,"I love tho look of these chairs!! One and only thing wrong to me as a bigger dude is that the chair seat portion it‚Äôs self is a little smaller, I can fit inside but if I were any bigger it would be a squeeze! Cool looking, and seems to hold well so far!",4
3389,"I like these headphones but wish the cord was longer. My niece uses them with her phone just fine, but when we plug into her computer she has a real limited range of movement. Really cute design though and good sound quality .",4
3390,"Fit perfect got my MacBook Charging again 2012 13""",4
3391,"These cartridges are reliable. I‚Äôve been using the, for over 3 years. But the shipping package/box is terrible. There‚Äôs no cushioning for anything inside, and the cartridges just bang around in the box.",4
3392,"I've read all the Joy Ellis Niki Galena books and the first Jackman & Evans. Lost Daughters is the best of the bunch. I thought it was very well written (with the exception of a few typos), had a great plot, and the twists & turns kept me guessing. The only thing I don't like is her use of fictional towns rather than real places! As a Yank with a British wife whose family lives in the fens I've spent a lot of time running along the narrow fen roads and visiting fen villages and towns. I don't understand why some authors take their creative licence to the point of creating towns and villages. I'm sure most readers would prefer to see places they can associate with rather than contrived locations!!",4
3393,I like these boots and they are very comfortable but it took a few tries to get the right one. I wear a 10 in sneakers but settled on the 9 for this boot. The 8 fit much better around my leg but was just too small for my feet. Since it has free returns and shipping it wasn‚Äôt an issue.,4
3394,Fits mt troy built 200 perfectly. Install was easy. YouTube video if you need help. Only giving 4 stars since it was missing the bolt so we had to get a new one to attach it. Otherwise would have been a 5 star review.,4
3395,"Edited review (POST-con): LOVE this wig!! It's SO CUTE on and I got so many compliments for my Wreck it Ralph 2 costume!! I trimmed it a bit in certain places (it was pretty uniform on the top, so I cut some pieces to get dimension), and I pulled a LITTLE volume from the top (though it didn't do much, tbh). I wore it all day at the con and the ""tangling"" is minimal for what it is. For non-lace-front, this is great quality!",4
3396,"He said it's a little big, but it's nicely made.",4
3397,Very nice bloom and taste. I did not expect them to be so small packaged... Very nice,4
3398,"Not quite sure, but I am consuming it with black Maca powder. I do feel more energy and better erection... Maybe you should try it as I am.",4
3399,Pretty good for the money,4
3400,"Haven't used it yet, but can't wait to see the results",4
3401,They were exactly what I needed at the very affordable price and in many colors,4
3402,There are not many to choose from that are reasonably priced. This one seems to do the job.,4
3403,Excellent online basic management business guide book. So many things to learn. Very effective tricks & tips for taking the business top on the level.,4
3404,"While these slippers are definitely comfortable, I found the wonderful cushion to have been squished down pretty quickly unfortunately. I still wear these often as they are easy to slip on and off and I can wear them to step outside briefly when needed. I find these to be my practical pair of slippers and while the extra cushion I had been hoping for is now deflated so to speak, I still find that they are comfy enough. They definitely are anti skid which is fantastic for safety and they are able to be washed, so that is also a plus.",4
3405,"I love the way these look, different especially for the price, BUT the Velcro barely stays shut as my daughter walks. The leg/ankle section is too small when the Velcro is closed, hence why it opens right up as she‚Äôs walking. I‚Äôd be afraid a larger size would be too big in the toe region.",4
3406,"this little cookie turntable is really great for decorating fancy cookies and cupcakes. I think it will be great for various craft projects , too, like clay figures.",4
3407,Was literally mini you can't even use it without fear of using it,4
3408,"Loved these initially, bright, worked as advertised. But one of the two I bought has already gone out. Have only been using it for 2 months and it's already dead. UPDATE: The company responded immediately when they saw my review and send me a replacement bulb. So great customer service!",4
3409,Haven‚Äôt actually used as saving for move n new house. Reason for not giving a 5.,4
3410,"Good knife for the money,",4
3411,Very easy to install,4
3412,"I've had this 3 gallon tank for exactly 1 year. The lights are still perfect. Filter still works perfectly. My major issues with the tank is the covering. The tank has a glass cover for the entire tank. It also has a thin black plastic cover for the filter. Unfortunately, the black thing plastic cover doesn't seal like the glass cover so it let's in dust, etc. With all that said, I LOVE THIS TANK. I want to upgrade from my current 3 gallon tank to a 10 gallon tank relatively soon. I won't be going with this brand for the 10 gallon tank because of the covers not sealing completely. With that being said, for someone looking for a fish thank that is small and great to have as a decoration, this 3 gallon tank is fantastic.",4
3413,"These work well but when you get back in shower, it comes off and they tell you to continue to use it till you get to the color you want. How does that work whe. I see it on the white washcloth?",4
3414,"Decent, but it does have a cheap feel to it. You can tell the plastic is really thin and the power/charging light shines through the case a little.",4
3415,Love it... exactly what is described.. If i had enough bathrooms i would have one in every color.,4
3416,"I bought this for my sister and she has been using it for a while. So far good. Though it cannot handle very top notch apps but that is expected for a phone of this price range. It heats up a little sometimes but that has not been a big issue this far. Overall, it‚Äôs a good phone for the price.",4
3417,"It was alright, Looked very similar to picture",4
3418,These lights are super bright and worked out perfect for both of my trucks,4
3419,Actually works but difficult to open and clean out the hair. I feel like I am about to break it.,4
3420,"These are my go to ink cartridges. Always work great & last a fairly long time. My only complaint is the price. Cheaper than buying at Office Depot or similar store, but still pricey.",4
3421,"My co-worker had the previous model, which included retractable ear buds and a hard case for storage. She highly recommended it, so I purchased this more recent model hoping for those some benefits, but they were not included. These work great, especially for the price point, but be prepared to sacrifice those previous conveniences.",4
3422,"it works but it‚Äôs hard to pull the bags from the bottom, I just pull it from the top.",4
3423,"I got two of these for my headboard for more personalized and direct lighting than my bedside table. I enjoy the different light choices and dimmer feature. But boy was I happy when I needed to do a home repair. I plugged both into my laptop where I played the instructional video and stuck each light turned up full into the cavity of my washer. It was like daylight and the slim design allowed me to place the lights just where they were needed and get full illumination. When I first started working under my washer I was using my cell phone for light! If I had a flashlight at the time it would have been too heavy and awkward, these lights are very lightweight.",4
3424,This case protects pretty well. Bought it for my son's 6x and he likes it.,4
3425,"the antena booster work as intended, landing gear is good, but the visor cause problem for gimbal if u using push on lense",4
3426,Gives you time to bring it in house and plan your next day trip with out worrying about battery going dead.,4
3427,"Nice seat ... just wrong size, my fault.",4
3428,"Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.",4
3429,"I bought this for my husband. These are good and do the job. My only problem is that I wish the top was attached. It is quite a bit of work to get the bottle in, but once in, the drink stayed cold.",4
3430,It does seem to make it feel cooler,4
3431,I use this for making holiday embellishments to shirts that I don‚Äôt want to be permanent. It‚Äôs awesome - I just wish it had a *little* more staying power. I will purchase again!,4
3432,Really like these. I wear them to bed under nightgown and they are so comfy. Don't pinch or ride up. I gave it 4 stars because the black one is much smaller than the rest so I can't wear them. I will reorder these.,4
3433,"These chords are a good value but one of the two is already flemsy on the end to where it doesn't stay plugged in very well after just a couple of months. The cable part of these seems durable but the charging end could be improved. Overall, these are okay for the money especially since they are so long.",4
3434,"It's a nice light mount. The only issue I have with it is that it turns on my handlebar. I even put some double-sided tape underneath it before I wrapped the strap around in the hopes that it would stay in one spot, but it still doesn't. It's strapped as tightly as it can be. I gave it 4 stars because otherwise, I like it due to its lightness and flexibility.",4
3435,"these do help, will see how long they will last.",4
3436,These need time to recover from shipping...like a few hours to adjust to your room and show similar readings. There were pretty accurate compared to other thermostats and thermometers but I wouldn‚Äôt bet my life on the accuracy. If you need lab quality you‚Äôll probably have to spend more than a couple dollars but for most projects these should be fine.,4
3437,"The dimming capability on the bulbs is not the best. If you dim it down to 5% it's more like you've dimmed it down to 50%. Easy setup, works great - just couldn't give 5 stars because of the above.",4
3438,I wanted to give one star. Not for the quality of the book or the writing but for the story. Crushing. I'd like to read an update from the author.,4
3439,I did have to iron it for some time carefully to get the creases to a point of not being a major issue. In addition I used thumb tacks on the wall to smooth it out. It looks pretty good for a cheap backdrop for a photo booth.,4
3440,"Like the ease of clock to use with my project. Dislike I had to get special batteries /carbon bs alkaline. It wasn‚Äôt that easy to get hands put on, And metal bent easily.",4
3441,i should've bought 2,4
3442,Works good. Well made. Simple design. Easy to clean in the dishwasher.,4
3443,this remote control is definitely not the same quality as my original controller ! It seems to work OK sometimes the buttons are less responsive I had to use the battery cover from the old one because the new one was a little bit loose Overall I am happy with the remote control,4
3444,"They are ok, not hard but worth the money",4
3445,Just started taking it. I like the fresh smell of the vitamins. I haven't noticed much of a difference in energy yet.,4
3446,i enjoyed using this diaper for my daughter until it run out of stocks and i had to switch to huggies movers for the size I need. but it didn't irritate my daughter at all. good for sensitive skin.,4
3447,"Overall the swimsuit is great- while it fit the body, it was too short for the torso. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and it hardly pulled up my chest. It otherwise fit great but seemed about 2‚Äù too short and would‚Äôve had the girls falling out the top! The swimsuit is very high quality, gorgeous print and customer service is great though! I‚Äôll just stick with 2 pieces for my torso length. I have several other Tempt Me suits and they are all perfect!",4
3448,You can‚Äôt adjust the focus of the light ...imagine fishing at night and not being being able to focus in/out...but light is bright,4
3449,Cute but feather are much smaller than pictured.,4
3450,Works great and very easy to install.,4
3451,Have to keep memory cards separate from cassette cases.,4
3452,messy but does it's job,4
3453,Great quality but TINY,4
3454,"Nice protector, but I question its longevity as it got a small chip on the edge within a day of application. It isn‚Äôt totally clear, but is anti fingerprint.",4
3455,"I'm no Chef, but the nice large size it good for flipping over omelettes!",4
3456,The quality of this product is still surprising. Super glad I bought it again!,4
3457,"I bought this about a year ago, and it still works. I only had a few issues, but nothing that made the tablet impossible to use. It was a great replacement after my Wacom broke. When I upgrade I will actually be able to give this tablet to my siblings without worry they'll have trouble with it.",4
3458,Works well!!! Used them for my patio area provide a lot of light for it being small. However one had a loose part inside I could hear if I shake it but since they are hung it didn‚Äôt really matter! Turn on quickly,4
3459,"Fast shipping, just what we needed.",4
3460,"Good color, about as large as screen as I feel comfortable with.",4
3461,"This was a great story. I understood at the end the angst Chrissy felt. I suspected the end, then didn‚Äôt, ....",4
3462,Minor nit: Would be nice if it came with black screws instead of silver,4
3463,"I bought these for riding on my scooter in town. They are great! They kept the wind and dust, dirt out of my eyes unlike regular sunglasses. They are polarized and are great for summer. They are hard to see with at night, maybe it's just me.",4
3464,It's the size of a child's toy. Good to use for a light touch up before company. It takes a while to get the same spot clean.,4
3465,Smears really easily but great brush size,4
3466,"Kids loved the flavors. Were a little disappointed that the flavors were so unequal in the canister. 3 of some, 6 of others.",4
3467,These looked great. They looked very nice on the wedding invitations we put them on. We only had one break and had a few loose stones.,4
3468,Great product for the price. As accurate as it needs to be for my game. Wouldn‚Äôt make a difference if it was off a yard or two. Slope feature makes a huge difference!!! Gotta have steady hands though. The flag was hard to hit sometimes.,4
3469,"I bought this for my kids for our camping trip. I loved it because i did not have to take them to the restroom in the middle of the night. Easy to clean up, no mess.",4
3470,my 9 yr old daughter loved it,4
3471,"These mirrors work great! They were easy to install, for perfect, and are very clear. They seem to be holding up through rain, travel and the car wash. Great price too!",4
3472,PRICE IS TOO EXPENSIVE BUT TASTE IS GOOD,4
3473,"I purchased this body pillow hoping it would help me after surgery. Let me just say, it was/is exactly what I needed! I couldn‚Äôt have made a better decision.",4
3474,"Lord was just awesome. I don't know what it was about the way his dialogue was written, but I really loved him. Elle was pretty quirky and fun as well. What I would have loved to have read in this story, however, would have been more backstory on Lord and how his upbringing affected him. There were references to it and in the story before about his brother it was even mentioned that Lord was somehow messed up from childhood. Yet I didn't really see that come out in his character. He actually seemed very grounded and mature...which is a good thing, but I would have loved to see his character given more dimension.",4
3475,"Runs a bit small, but still fit okay. The headband could be made more toddler friendly. My daughter did not like the hard plastic headband. Overall adorable costume though!",4
3476,"For being tall I have abnormally small feet for my height, but they are wide. I ordered 8.5 thinking I would need a little bigger to accommodate my width for getting them on and comfort level. I could easily fit into an 8. Overall nice shoe. Wanted memory foam since I will be doing a lot of walking on an upcoming trip. Wanted a little different look for a slip on. Gave it a 4 since I haven‚Äôt wore them for intended purpose yet.",4
3477,"This cool bug zapper is quiet which I like... I also like that it has a fan... I saw a tiny spider coming down so I picked up the zapper, put it in front of the spider, and it sucked the spider right in and zapped it...",4
3478,"It seems strong and looks nice. It feels great on my face, I am happy with this purchase",4
3479,Slow start but good read overall. It took me awhile to get into it but about halfway through it finally started moving quickly. I had a hard time putting it down. The ending was a surprise.,4
3480,"I bought this item to store dirty clothes. It's good to take to the laundromat. Just don't put too much weight on it. I put a heavier load of dirty clothes, than usual, on it once and the handles ripped off. Luckily, it has two handles (shown in photo) so it's still usable. It CAN hold a lot of clothes because it is deep and the material stretches if you plan on not transporting it. However, if you plan to take the hamper laundromat don't overload it. Overall, I found this order very useful because it comes in a pack of two, so I can easily organize my whites and colors when doing laundry. When I only need to use one, I can easily fold the other and it does not take much space to store. I rent a small room, so I wanted something that wouldn't take as much space and is affordable. I'm happy with my purchase.",4
3481,"This little guy works right out of the box. No formatting required. There is a music folder already on the device so, just drag and drop your music in that folder or you can re-create the folder and name it something else. Once the music is on there, using the interface you can choose different ways to access that music (shuffle, accessing the folders directly or playing all the songs). The device itself is very light, think and can easily fit in your pocket. Not much to it really. It comes with a cable that allows you to connect to the computer to be able to put music, video or books on the device. It is also used to charge the device. It comes with headphones as well, which are pretty cheap but get the job done. My only gripe with the device is that even though it is light, it does feel like I can break this thing if I sneeze. Doesn't feel durable. But, all in all, great device for the prices.",4
3482,very nice but I expected it to be a little larger. It is a good size for a table top sign though.,4
3483,Looks great but pockets are smaller than I expected,4
3484,"The organizer comes ready to go just open box but in drawers and thats it no drilling. I also found that it has some weight and is not flimsy. I found that the stackable organizer worked better in my garage then the kitchen because of the smaller drawers, but in the work bench or on the counter there are multiple items that fit in smaller drawers.",4
3485,"Cute outdoor lanterns. I purchased two rubbed bronze ones. They have a black and gold color to them. They are not too bad for the price. I paired them with a real black, metal lantern and it‚Äôs hard to tell that they are plastic. The candles are bright. I like the timer function. I don‚Äôt have to turn them on/off every night and they come on/turn off at the same time. As you can tell, the candles look almost as good, if not as good, as the Luminara candle in my metal lantern. They were well packaged and arrived quickly.",4
3486,"The game gets more complex as you proceed. You have to have a keen eye to get through it, and I enjoy a challenge!",4
3487,Great lightweight suitcase. Comes with removable plastic covering to help eliminate scratches,4
3488,It seems to take a while to charge it up to full charge. Maybe it is the charger cord that's bad.,4
3489,"The track are a nice addition to the train set however it would have been nice to have more of them or at least some curved tracks, or at least had the opportunity to buy a package of straight and curved tracks.",4
3490,Love these boots going my 2nd winter with them and they're still wearing well.,4
3491,Did as advertised but in some urinals it did not fit well so we reshaped by cutting.,4
3492,Little bit other types noise,4
3493,Color doesn‚Äôt work but that‚Äôs ok price was great,4
3494,Works great for that purpose but they aren't really well made. Ok for the money,4
3495,Holds up nicely but also slightly tilts down.,4
3496,"pros: -softest fabric ever, wow, so warm!!! -cutest design -fits p well round the body! cons: -short on the legs, even with having it fit a lot lower -buttons spread apart, so it can be a little chilly outside overall, rlly awesome!!!! bought for a costume to hand out candy 4 kids!",4
3497,"It's beautiful. Hurts your armpits though, even after adjusting the straps.",4
3498,I returned this because I failed to notice the size of the product. Found something different with coloring pages. These are very well made and really cute though. No complaints other than my own personal error!,4
3499,I used it to check my honey. It worked like I hoped it would.,4
3500,"Interesting premise. Storyline was difficult to follow at times. More tragedy than necessary, but it kept my interest until the finish.",4
3501,"It was smaller than I expected, but the quality is good and it‚Äôs just as cute as the picture!",4
3502,"Very cool shirt, vibrant colors, but weirdly out of proportion. Too short for a gift to my friend. Returning",4
3503,"First off, I have to say the color is loveeeee. A lot of things I order in purple always come too light, too kiddish, too weird, too neon-ish, what have you. But this purple was deep and lush and I love it, the umbrella is sturdy and really good quality. Probably best umbrella I‚Äôve had. Comes with a cover and while it may not have much functional use, it really keeps it looking sharp.",4
3504,Good quality. Used for craft project,4
3505,This is a great tray. The space for ice is not that big but it does hold some. I would have preferred for the trays not to be vented. When I use it for dips I just cover the bottom on a bit of foil paper or wrap. The lids are a plus.,4
3506,"I'm 5'3"" 170 and the large was perfect! Love this shirt, one of the ties are messed up but I can work through it.",4
3507,"Just what I wanted, fingers crossed it will hold up too lots of use!",4
3508,I'm very happy with this purchase.,4
3509,Very good product for the price. I gave 4 stars because it is a pain to tighten enough to keep it in place. The inside of the clamp should have some ridges so that it grips the spacers and will keep it in place better. Came from overseas and it was not mentioned online. I really did not like that. They had wrong address and it went to PA instead of MS. The shipper called me for directions and was kind enough to reroute it to me with no extra charge. It was slow to ship and it was very slow to arrive coming from overseas.,4
3510,"It fit my Troy Bilt Pony and it's a good quality belt. Nothing spectacular, but better than average.",4
3511,"Great read, also very informative about the game of football. Liked TO but really loved Poppy and her extraordinary group of friends. Guessing Maxwell and Brynn are up next, can't wait to read!!!",4
3512,Great for a quick press! Love that it heats up fast! I totally recommend this! It works!,4
3513,"Finally a game that has a good story and the choice of where to go.I realize that you need to make money to keep the game going, but enough is enough.",4
3514,Large selection of burrs. Perfect for light duty jobs which is all I use them for. When they ware out great price makes them easy to replace. Gave 4 stars only because they are for light duty work only in my opinion .,4
3515,Very good game. I enjoy the challenge. Some of them are easy and some are hard to get. You can enjoy a lot of time playing.,4
3516,Good for sore muscles as well as decongestant cold relief.,4
3517,Gave as a gift to my friend and she loves them both,4
3518,I got the product today but didn‚Äôt get the free scoop that it supposed to come with it . Disappointed.,4
3519,Went pretty well. Hardest part was getting the case opened. The plastic tool didn't work so well for that. I had to improvise.,4
3520,"Tripod comes apart alot, but just screws back in.",4
3521,"Pics are smaller than the original Polaroid cameras from 30 years ago, pics come out slower and quality is about same.",4
3522,Must have to use in water softer systems,4
3523,Could have a bigger pocket for my package but they fit well,4
3524,"Loved the style and quality however while wearing the ring kept turning upside down so instead of seeing beautiful design in ring, I saw a ring gap. Also nice and shiny until I went swimming in chlorinated pool, than it turned an ugly dull gray.",4
3525,Got this for my 05 escalade EXT. I assumed that the fog lights would be identical but the bracket on top has a wierd indent that lowers it where the stock bracket is flat. I solved this by putting a few washers between the mount and the bracket to lift it so it's centered.,4
3526,I received white rose lights instead of the pink ones I ordered.,4
3527,The screen protector was delivered promptly and so far no issues with cracking and it has protected our phone. It's only been a week since we installed them. Not much use from them yet. Be glad to do review in a month or 2.,4
3528,"The stone is beautiful but the setting is loose, the stone already fell out. I‚Äôm glad I heard it fall.",4
3529,"Love the wig , its just hard to do the front,I will fix and tweak it,the wig looks like the picture",4
3530,"Used on my ice maker, worked like suppose to.",4
3531,This device is functional and has nice features. The clips are small and a bit hard to attach to anything of size but you can do what you need to do. Fantastic value.,4
3532,The animal print is great and realistic. I just wish instead of the whole cats face its just the cats mouth.,4
3533,Grinder works pretty well,4
3534,"It fits the YI 4k perfectly, placed a lanyard on the cover and it has a couple of hole to tie it to. The problem is the YI camera keeps locking up that you need to open the camera to remove the battery. One star off is because the black one attracts lint that makes it took like a junk camera. The while is translucent and it would have been nice if it is white. Overall, I decided to just keep the camera naked and just buy those tripod screw eye to hook a neck lanyard to protect the camera.",4
3535,"Very pleased overall. I'm glad I tried these on at a local store before ordering on Amazon though. Per the sizing guide, it recommended medium. I have average to small hands but had to order a large. It's still pretty tight around the thumbs when trying to take them off. Very sturdy gloves with Velcro that stays put. Protect hands very well even with aggressive weight lifting.",4
3536,"Titan series heroes are very good for your child's first Marvel or super hero figures. No small parts, minimal articulation. We have five or so different characters for my son and they are very durable. Very pleased with these items. Nice prices for these here.",4
3537,I needed a new phone case Bc my other one broke. And it looks great! I have a black phone and the black case with the gold makes it look even better. Couldn‚Äôt be happier!,4
3538,Arrived at the end of July and on delivery time. The mat itself: The Good: -came with a free gym towel -came with straps and sleeve for storage -came with pvc pipe to roll it on -feels good -the price is good The Bad -the only issue i could see is the material probably would not be suitable for dropping weights on. But then again this is a yoga mat. Overall: 4.5/5,4
3539,"If filled the inside, the outside pockets were restrictive. Didn't fit under seats on any flights (domestic or international). But was light and worked well for what I needed.",4
3540,Just what I was expecting. Looks really cute.,4
3541,"I have fair skin, it‚Äôs slightly to dark but I can make it work. Very well packaged for opening. Not a loose powder. Love the highlighter!",4
3542,"Each of the mounts are sturdy and easy to use. However, the only one that will work with my Galaxy 9 Plus in an OtterBox Commuter case was the windshield mount. The phone fits in the holder, but the other mounts cannot support the weight. I gave it to my boyfriend for his small phone and it is perfect.",4
3543,I liked this book for its raw grittiness and drama. Lyric went through several ups and downs and betrayals but kept it real. The book was a quick and easy read. Remember folks- Write a review to help an author out.,4
3544,So thin...I could gather info from Google.,4
3545,I used these to add vinyl and personalize them for my nephews with names that aren‚Äôt common! Perfect!,4
3546,"If you have a knack for putting things together, you'll be able to assemble this with your eyes closed. But if you follow instructions, the drawings here leave something to be desired. I finally used the picture on the front of the box to give me guidance I needed. Other than the minor glitch I just described, the product is well made, does the job for which it's intended and I'm happy with it.",4
3547,"Can‚Äôt complain, kids loved them. They stick to the walls and super stretchy.",4
3548,"I really love this keyboard. The only thing I would say is that sometimes the Y button won‚Äôt work on the first time, but other than that its great.",4
3549,The weights arrived in a good time and met our every expectation.,4
3550,This has worked for me. The grandson can‚Äôt push it down . He does not try to put toys under it either. I just make sure we are in the room with him. It works better than what I had up around the banister.,4
3551,The urn was as described is lite weight and looks nice,4
3552,"Are fine, just a bit big for a small thin person who is me.",4
3553,It was of good quality but pretty thin.,4
3554,Just what I expected. Took stain beautifully! Very happy with my project. Pretty heavy block of wood.,4
3555,great product should have bought it in the 8' length,4
3556,The costume turned out to be better quality than what I expected. The costume was a bit small though.,4
3557,Up and coming brand. The stuff goes on nice. And you can either give it that flat look or shiny. Held on well for two days. But like any other tire dressing it didn't last past the first rain.,4
3558,"Feels good in the hand. As other reviews said, the stitching on the M emblem is a little dodgy, but for the price it's a great upgrade.",4
3559,It is worth it for the top! It is really flattering but the highwaisted bottoms just hit at an awkward area for me. I have a little bit of a pooch but it seems to have made it look worse. I'm 5'4 136lbs and 36C.,4
3560,"This case is very pretty, yet professional looking. The rotation is important for me and works well, and I also like having a stylus holder and pocket for business cards etc. As others have mentioned, it is difficult to remove, but I rarely need to once it‚Äôs set up. The only other improvement I would like is that there are only two positions, a third would be perfect. All in all a good choice for the price.",4
3561,This product worked as excellent as described. My home was left with a bunch of cut wires on my built in home audio at the network panel and Ethernet jacks. I‚Äôm not a professional but for what I needed to get done and it worked great a little background noise but not issue for me.,4
3562,A little big but good quality.,4
3563,"It‚Äôs STUNNING and the shoes are perfect, very high quality all around. But the glitter on the dress does shed a bit. Overall, I‚Äôm super impressed with it.",4
3564,The magnetic closure works great. The only criticism I have is that the folding part that is supposed to act as a stand doesn't really work that well.,4
3565,Like Palmolive Dish Liquid better I think,4
3566,"We had a big party and did about 20 pumpkins. Best to have a rubber mallet or two. Will also need cutting tools to get the top open and a scraper to empty the guts. These lasted the whole party and only a couple got bent (probably from misuse). So if you only do a pumpkin or two a year, this will last for 10 years",4
3567,"From a 1 time regular wear, they start looking old & worn. Price wars good, we needed socks, these work for now. PRO: they are comfy",4
3568,This phone case is a little bit bulkier than I expected but after having it on my phone for over a month I‚Äôm use to it. Love the back!,4
3569,"needs auto cut-off for alarm, loud alarm tone",4
3570,"I was pleasantly surprised by the material used in making this curtain. It makes my bathroom look fantastic, fancier than what it is. The curtain darkens the room just like it states it would. A great purchase, I would recommend it to my friends and family.",4
3571,"got gel polish off, but took 2 applications after buffing nails",4
3572,Pretty good for cheap hydrometers. One was way off but I suppose that's not too bad.,4
3573,Great little book to help introduce yourself to some of nature‚Äôs little gems.,4
3574,Bought for my nephew. He seemed really tickled.,4
3575,"It definitely produces ozone. We have it in a bathroom where the cat box is, and that is the only reason we got it: to deal with those odors, which it does easily. It produces far more that needed for that job. Which would be OK, I figure the excess will get pulled out by the central vent system that is in a nearby hallway, and be spread through the rest of the house and possibly give some benefits. But sometimes when going in that room, the ozone smell is a bit excessive. But, it does produce ozone, just like it says. And it is adjustable, but I would prefer it could be turned down a bit more.",4
3576,Very convenient! Has different force. Good for yoga and daily stretch. We also use it for working out and muscle gaining.,4
3577,Requires long term use to make decision.,4
3578,Imagery is beautiful. Card stock isn‚Äôt the best. Peels quite easily.,4
3579,"There are many features about this water bottle that I love. These water bottles do not leak once the lid is closed properly, they keep cold drinks cold for many hours, and they are durable! Since they are stainless steel, they will dent if dropped, but that is to be expected.",4
3580,"Fit well, color selection is blain, go with the smaller pack if you are in question of whether you would wear them all. Good quality",4
3581,"I enjoyed using this product, very helpful limit more space for my use. Thank you",4
3582,Fairly comfortable ankle weights that can be weight adjusted. Good for increasing resistance in light workouts. Useful for back exercises that use legs.,4
3583,My dogs like them but I can't tell that they help get rid of the fleas,4
3584,"While this product broke and I had originally written a negative review, customer service of this company reached out to me and gave me a full refund, so I am quite happy! The actual ottoman was great before it unfortunately broke on me.",4
3585,small device unlike those old wide players. Thumbs up,4
3586,"Does it‚Äôs job but it just feels cheap in my hands. The seam between both sides of the cases noticeably feel awkward while holding the handle. For the price, it‚Äôs a great buy though.",4
3587,Good fit. As expected.,4
3588,"Nice looking, great fit and good quality.",4
3589,"Nice goggles, clear vision and easy to fit.",4
3590,"Love the product overall, the only reason why I give it 4 stars is because of the way it‚Äôs packaged. It makes it difficult to unravel because you have to be careful not to have the ornaments fall off, and one did but its fine",4
3591,very black and good for precision but taking one star away as it takes too much time to apply,4
3592,"Fit was as expected, however the pants length fell just above the ankle.",4
3593,Cannot thing of anyone that i would recommend the book to as i know no one who like science fiction?,4
3594,Great shirt fit as expected love the saying.,4
3595,"This is a basic puffer coat. If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations. The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to ""puff up"" a bit. I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me. I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed. However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine. There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later. The hood functions, but no ties on it. The front zipper works. There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room. There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you). There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT. For the price, I think it is fine. I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold. I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign. However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent). Overall, I am pleased. The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch.",4
3596,"It was different to install, but if you follow the directions they give you, everything turns out better than I thought it would.",4
3597,I wear a size 8 shoe and fit in a size 7 muck boot. Boot is very comfortable!,4
3598,slow starting movie but gets good and the ending is good,4
3599,"I purchased it mainly to be able to vacuum the gravel without having to drain the water. Worked well, only down side is if gravel particularly dirty, you may need to wash the screen frequently. Regardless, I'm glad I purchased it. To me, it was worth it and saved me time.",4
3600,Love that it stays for a long time. But don't use overnight might turn white.,4
3601,"This hair is good but I had a few issues. Pros: The shipping was super-fast. I received it in two days with Prime and it was a weekend when I ordered. (Sat. got it on Mon). It is soft and very manageable. Holds curls very well. Does not have such a bad smell. Cons: It sheds a lot. Straight out the pack just running my hand through there was shedding. After I was washed it even more shedding. There was rust in the hair. Yes, that‚Äôs right RUST. Perhaps it‚Äôs from being stored for a long time but the combs were rusty. Even some parts of the lace had rust on it. This is very disappointing but you get what you pay for. I had a wedding to go to last minute so I thoroughly washed it and even disinfected it with Lysol. I also bought some wig combs to sew them in myself, instead of using the rusty one attached to the wig. Lol, Desperate times calls for desperate measures. I knew I would not be able to get my money back after cutting the lace and sewing clips in so I didn‚Äôt bother sending it back. The pics here. The hair is beautiful when styled and holds curls very well. To be honest, if this hair didn‚Äôt shed or have rust in it, I would rate it 5 stars. Unfortunately, paying $100 for hair I do not expect it to be rusty. I had to buy separate wig combs and sew them in myself so I don‚Äôt get the rust in my own hair and scalp. That was doing a lot. Hope you guys have better luck than I did. This hair really has the potential to be great though.",4
3602,"Custom is what I expected, quality is good. My nephew loved it.",4
3603,Had to order a second round of the glass as the first one arrived damaged.,4
3604,"limited on direction of choice. wanted the in pipe to be on the side but is only set up for the water to come in the middle pipe and split left or right, I wanted the water to flow in from a side so i could divert the water straight or off to the left making it a 90 degree bend. Works well though, I just had to re arrange some piping.",4
3605,Just a nice product overall!,4
3606,I love them but smaller than I thought. Bought the medium and had to send back and exchanged for Large.,4
3607,It serves it purpose but is flimsy. I had it bite my fingers a couple of times while folding it back.,4
3608,"I just got the bag and only used it once. It kept my ice cream from turning into a smoothy during my trip from the grocery store to my home. It was a sunny 90 degree day. So, I am happy.",4
3609,"Even though I returned it I gave it four stars because it worked as advertised. One should be aware that for the garment to do the lifting and shaping that it does, It requires the seams to be very heavy and I found the anal area to be uncomfortable, however I know with time I probably would have become used to it, but I chose instead to try a different product.",4
3610,Lots of things to watch just wish they had more up to date movies,4
3611,My daughter loves the new night light.,4
3612,The nice feature of this is that the middle leg has a USB charging connection on the end so you do not have to search for a wire connector. When it is charging the light glows red until fully charged and the it goes out. The lamp also has multiple intensity levels so you can adjust for brightness and loss of battery power. The clip is a bit problematic with paperbacks - a longer jaw would be better. The lamps flexibility is stiff so it holds it shape nicely.,4
3613,They pulled me into the story. But would have liked a little background information on the way the whole school and cities came to be.,4
3614,I gave it to my grand daughter to wear. She really liked them,4
3615,This plant is pretty good for the price. Does appear slightly artificial up close but looks great from a distance.,4
3616,I purchased this as a gift. Recipient loved it but found it a tad confusing. Thankfully I had gone through and figured out how to use prior to gifting. I would recommend that manufacturer tweak information that accompanies product so it‚Äôs easier to figure out.,4
3617,"When I recieved it, the outer sleeve was kinda banged up that was it tho everything else was perfect it's definitely worth it for the price",4
3618,It matches well for under my eyes. Was in a car accident & have permanent dark damage under one eye. Covers it nicely. Lasts pretty long and covers up scars. After some skin cancer surgery the Dr. recommended this to help cover the scars which it does. Very creamy! Does not last if it gets wet however. Need to reapply if you cry or your eyes tear from allergies,4
3619,Very cute. I didn't read the dimensions but its smaller than expected. Good for key holder.,4
3620,The time I ordered it until I received it was good. I felt the shipping cost was too much. Can not verify the effectiveness of this product until I take it for some time.,4
3621,"Over all, a nice dog house, but contrary to what the description says, the roof does not come off. Ok, in theory one could take it off if one wanted to remove a bunch of screws and didn‚Äôt mind the whole thing falling apart. So, it really does not come off. That said, the doorway is huge and I don‚Äôt think it would be difficult to wash it out that way. The assembly was easy enough by following the pictures. Although a couple of screw holes didn‚Äôt line up perfectly, these were not much of a problem. I doubt that the house would be completely water proof - maybe - but I‚Äôm using it under a patio, so that is not an issue for me. I wish there was a door flap available.",4
3622,"I think this hat is best for people with thick hair. I have very thin hair, the pony tail has to be so high, to fit through the hole, that what's left of my pony tail is pretty straggly. I'm going to try a top knot next time I wear it",4
3623,"The ring is pretty, diamond accents are very small.",4
3624,"works just the way we want it to. Just wish it had a backlite so it could be seen better in the dark. As is we have turn on light to adjust if we need to adjust,",4
3625,The cover works just as described. It is easy to put on and works well. It did not cover my umbrella completely at the bottom is the only reason I gave 4 stars. Could be my umbrella.,4
3626,"not the best, but this is keto - it is good",4
3627,"Amazingly these fit really good. Didn‚Äôt show any of my cellulite wow, also helps hide muffin top. I ordered more.",4
3628,"The magnetic closure is not very strong; otherwise, the case is what I wanted and needed",4
3629,Perfect pricing and lovely. One figure came damaged but for this price it's Worth it.,4
3630,Very comfortable shoes.,4
3631,Was snug for the size. I ordered larger size as well. Nicely made though.,4
3632,"I liked the product! They were smaller than I thought, but loved the light show, especially for this time of year! Also the remotes- how fun. Would definitely recommend. I‚Äôd love to put them in my moms house, she would enjoy but not sure what her husband would think.",4
3633,This is perfect to replace my high end purse strap. It matches really well. The only downside is that it feels a little light and not as durable.,4
3634,"I like this punch bought it for a friend and decided to get one for myself. It‚Äôs a pretty punch, it does stick at times, if dropped it hasn‚Äôt fallen apart yet, I think it‚Äôs sturdy. Works well on paper.",4
3635,"It's a magnet, haven't used yet, but expect it to hold keys.",4
3636,I have had to use these a lot recently even though they were purchased for camping. They are easy to use and work great in all the rooms needed in.,4
3637,The product came in time for the birthday party. He liked it and said it works great and gives him the back support that his office chair doesn't,4
3638,"These are really nice quality cards. They are not glossy, but I like that. The design is really cute, including the inside graphics. A really good value as well. Envelopes are good quality, too. Will order from this company again.",4
3639,"These cables are wonderful, And the customer service is great! Nice, Feel good. In my family it is necessary. These cables are a great value. I'm extremely satisfied with the speedy delivery! Exactly what I wanted.",4
3640,Work as stated will order again .,4
3641,Super fast and amazingly reliable whole food recipes which call for staples ingredients and require very little time to cook them ‚Äì this is the best possible choice working person like me can make. Huge help and inspiration - that's for sure!,4
3642,Stressful to transfer from previous box Xbox one,4
3643,"Well, I was sceptical at first but gave it a shot. Turns out it works or atleast seems to cut down on my sons fussiness quite a bit. Plus I liked that at the closure point it easily comes apart so less worry about strangulation, which was the biggest concern I had. (Never leave infant with necklace on without supervision or while sleeping)",4
3644,It was nice but some plastic parts are low quality.,4
3645,Does exactly what it should with ease. I did have to re-glue one of the rubber cushions/grips on the bottom after about 3 months. But still does what it should with minimal (if you consider that anything) maintenance.,4
3646,Need the inner frame so it's harder for it to break or crack screen. It's very stylish!,4
3647,"Just what I thought I was buying, no complaints.",4
3648,Definitely works for my small space but it‚Äôs not easy to install. I live in an building with very high ceilings. You have to adjust from the top and with the small space I had to stand on the toilet to get it to the right height then get my head between the wall/counter and the toilet to tighten from the bottom. Like I said it works great but took more effort then expected.,4
3649,Color is fine. I have ordered several times.,4
3650,A little thinner than I expected but nicely made.,4
3651,"After researching Monk fruit I found these. Came in good packaging, I cracked 1 open and boiled it to make the tea. It is defiantly sweet, I add water & Ice and it tastes like sweet tea to me. after a month, I cracked another 1 open and it was still good and made more tea out of it. Happy with it, hoping it does have healthful benefits. thx",4
3652,It works well for getting into tight spots. I just wish it worked with an Iphone.,4
3653,Easy to assemble and easy to install. First night the walkway was adorned with light.,4
3654,"Documentation for the camera was poor, or non-existent. This camera has so many modes and features that a full scale manual should come with it. I got into modes/screens that I couldn't figure out and the ""Start Up Guide,"" was worthless. Trying to find the manual online was another headache; never did find one...",4
3655,cool I like it.............,4
3656,Arrived quickly and in sturdy package. The palm rest is perfect and was a breeze to install. The touchpad was easy as well but honestly it is a little too thick for those who use it exclusively. All together it is a solid product.,4
3657,These slacks are the best I have gotten yet from Dickies through Amazon. They fit better than others and they look sharp.,4
3658,"cute, however I could tell that my miniature schnauzer was not comfortable in it.",4
3659,Like everything about it.,4
3660,Great to refurbish a compacted lawn. Assembly is a pain but this is heavy duty and not cheaply built. Local hard ware store visit is needed to buy blocks for weighting down. It tore up my clay perfectly with deep plugs. Down side is getting on and off the lawn mower to raise/lower the times when coming to a driveway or sidewalk.,4
3661,Was surprised by a few things I learned about Mr. Gable. Interesting,4
3662,"This has performed quite well. We bought it during the fires in Northern California when we were having very bad air days. What's amazed me is how much dust it picks up from the air itself. I vacuum the screens every week or so and they're quite full of dust. Which we're not breathing now, so that's good.",4
3663,"Have only used it for a couple of days, but so far so good. Has made a difference cooling a 2nd floor bedroom that is at the end of the HVAC duct runs and is always warmer in the summer and colder in the winter than the rest of the house.",4
3664,It will help a lot driving there. It helps too on the travel planning before going to New Zealand.,4
3665,"I had just gone through my last laundry hamper and was in desperate need for a replacement. This does the job, is durable and can fit a weeks load of dirty laundry.",4
3666,I like how warm they are.,4
3667,"If you are making a dish that needs to be stirred, do it with ease or you will tear the liner thus defeating the reason for having one. It makes cleanup so easy and leftovers can be lifted right out of crockpot and placed into leftover dish. Love them. Would give them 5 stars if they could handle being stirred.",4
3668,"Nice case, even though they make it sound like its for women theres nothing feminine about it.",4
3669,Rope completely broke off after a couple of months,4
3670,The color is not what I would call dark Navy. Or I should say the shirts I received. They look more like a mix of gray and blue not dark anything.. The size is good and they fit. I kept them as the color does not make much of a difference to me. Ron,4
3671,Tasty. Seem to have more regular and larger BM. Been recommending it to my family.,4
3672,The belts are good. They look good but were too small.,4
3673,It says it‚Äôs for the GM but it‚Äôs a bit small and there‚Äôs room on both sides of my purse,4
3674,"Great puzzle, but has to be assembled perfectly to work. Self made gauges are great. But would like a final view of how the gears should mesh. Mine are slightly out. I will have to guess which ones align and get them to mesh better. This will strictly trial and error as I have no view of the final product.",4
3675,I wear a 10.5 and they fit perfect,4
3676,MUST HAVE MISREAD AD WAS NOT AWARE THAT SCREEN HEAD DOES NOT DETACH FROM RAZOR MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CLEAN OTHERWISE GOOD CLEAN SHAVE,4
3677,Great product. Only complaint I have was in packaging some paints did leak. Otherwise excellent!,4
3678,It didn't stay opened very well when bent backwards.,4
3679,It‚Äôs a great jug! The only I don‚Äôt like is it‚Äôs a pain to clean because the material Will stain. Past that very satisfied,4
3680,Similar to Neutrogena and less expensively,4
3681,This backpack looks good and performs well. It‚Äôs a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days. The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps. There‚Äôs more straps on this bag than I can count. I‚Äôll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren‚Äôt really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag. Other than that I‚Äôve made this my new school bag for college. There‚Äôs a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided. The flag also is a great finish to it,4
3682,Really interesting history of food in the south and great recipes. Haven't finish reading all yet but very enjoyable.,4
3683,It takes at least two people to put it up. I had to get out plastic washers and wood screws to put it up on my wooden fence.,4
3684,Not exactly what I expected but surprisingly pleased with the product. It is quiet and a perfect size for my 20 gallon aquarium. I would definitely purchase again.,4
3685,"Love this protein, but what‚Äôs with the price fluctuation? I swear I‚Äôve bought this for $23 before, and it‚Äôs currently $30 before tax.",4
3686,"I love this wallet, looks exactly like the picture. The strap broke off after about 3 weeks but I just connected it to the zipper and still looks great",4
3687,Order was correct and on time. They looked really cute when blown up. Only thing I would say is that the string provided wasn't long enough to fit all the letters on. I had to make shift a second string.,4
3688,Nice body scrub puff. Its thick and lush.,4
3689,Love the table but I have to keep legs tightened so not to wobble.,4
3690,Purchased this for an elderly relative. Had to leave before I could find out if it worked out.,4
3691,Awesome case!! Very durable and my phone has not cracked. Only complaint is that it gets very dirty very easily :(,4
3692,"I got this product my mom. she loves it, she says it fits nice and comfortable",4
3693,Easy to wire up easy to install great price,4
3694,A bit smaller than expected but not enough to deal with the hassle of returns.....,4
3695,"Good product! Perfect size, cute, and easy. Glad I bought this!",4
3696,"Overall I like sprays more than this bottle, because it‚Äôs harder to spread the product evenly on my hair with my hands. But it‚Äôs definitely the way to go when you‚Äôre travelling, especially without a checked in bag!",4
3697,A good mens leather belt with perfect fit to the waist. Adjustable to waist size too.,4
3698,Product is in good working condition. The only issue is the skin does not fit to the controller perfectly. It stretches and often overlaps the buttons/triggers when in a serious gaming situation.,4
3699,"It works great and is very easy to use, a little tricky to set the clock but for this price I think is most then I expected",4
3700,Really hard to put on & drive with BUT super fluffy & cute I love it üòç,4
3701,"Her office routine and morning routine are wonderful. They are not too complicated or hard for a beginner like me, and yet I could feel the movements were helping me to stretch and relax some very tight muscle groups. I would recommend especially for a beginner like me.",4
3702,"I find this to look better, be of higher build quality, to have a better fit and to be more affordable than it has a right to, but one thing bugs me: it's difficult for me to push the power button on the iPhone 6S when it's in this case. I can do it, but it takes quite a bit of pressure to make it ""click."" Other than that, I've dropped the phone a couple times and this case has protected it very well. It's really grippy, which I love, and isn't so thick that the phone won't fit in a holster. And I love the super-visible color, which makes it difficult to misplace my phone. I recommend this case.",4
3703,Was kinda hard to put the screws in because holes were not predrilled,4
3704,My book club read this book recently. We all liked it for various reasons. This book provided us great entertainment.,4
3705,"It works as well as the original, but it isn‚Äôt the same. The membrane vinyl over the wire seems thinner than the original. Also it stretches in a different way ‚Äî in stretches in segments rather than as a whole. Although the vinyl is thinner, hopefully it is more resistant to cracking like the original.",4
3706,These stain markers work vey well for touching up stained wood furniture if it has been scratched or chipped. The stain does not adhere to all surfaces which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. I will also add that this is one of the better stain marker available and I have used many of what is out there.,4
3707,"Started right up. Works great to run a simple app with java 1.8 installed. I do not use a browser, so I cannot speak to internet. Touch screen works well, I have no complaints. Just remember, you get what you pay for. this is not a Cadillac.",4
3708,Great for working outside!,4
3709,Perfect for adding powder to a water bottle I use it for energy drinks on the go and my dogs go dog.,4
3710,Very soft and not too clingy. Still shows curves nicely though.,4
3711,"LOVE the look of this case and I love that it has a kickstand type thing! The only problem is that when I watch things, I generally watch landscape (main use for my iPad), and the stand just doesn‚Äôt seem to work well for landscape! I keep a chip clip with my iPad so I can use it to keep it up! Love that it‚Äôs clear so you can actually see that my iPad is rose gold! And the rhinestones are cute too, and I haven‚Äôt had any fall off, which was a fear before purchasing!",4
3712,"There is definitely ghosting on the other side of the page when you write, but I can live with that. I bought the white one which has stayed surprisingly clean through months of daily use.",4
3713,"I have had this product for less than 2 weeks so my experience and results are limited at this time. That said, so far I do like the product.",4
3714,"Case is nice, it's more hard case than that rubbery feel some cases have and I like that. Only downside is the brand name on the case, I got a clear case to show the phone. I'd prefer it not to be there but it's not a huge deal.",4
3715,It doesn't smell as good on me as my friend.,4
3716,"If your a rick and north fan , you will be living these comics. Even if you have never seen the show these comics will keep you laughing and well entertained",4
3717,"Very nice Dress, thin, need slips under",4
3718,I love the backpack. I thought it was gonna be a little bit bigger than what it is but overall i like my purchase,4
3719,Product worked well only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt come with a gasket so you will need to get one or you can use flex seal or something similar to create one,4
3720,"The bags are extremely durable and hold their vacuum well in the freezer, which is what I really bought them for. I had some problems evacuating some of the bags and contacted the seller who was extremely helpful. Since it appeared that the pump was at fault, he replaced not only the pump, but the whole kit, bags and all",4
3721,"I like the color. It suits my wedding Invitation theme. I gave it 4 stars because it's thin. Still workable though, I think the advantage with this kind of envelope is that you can bulk it up with invitations and rsvp's. Compared to a really thick but snuggly fitted envelope",4
3722,Good read easy to stay with. Couple of twists and turns to keep you guessing. C.J keeps writting I keep reading.,4
3723,"A super helpful book for the ones who wants to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It encouraged me to achieve the much-needed balance between work and health, wealth and happiness. Really nice!",4
3724,So far battery life is not as long as I had hoped for with battery replacement and the prediction of battery left seems to fluctuate- but I‚Äôve only charged it twice since I received it.,4
3725,"I had items in my leather wallet that I didn't really ever use, so being able to carry the day-to-day items only in my Fidelo wallet is working great. I no longer carry my wallet in my back pants pocket, since the Fidelo is thinner, which gives me greater security from any pickpocket. It fits fine in most of my vest or coat pockets. So far, I'm enjoying it.",4
3726,"Good quality and soft. They do shed a bit, but I imagine any others would too. I would buy again.",4
3727,"For the most part I enjoyed my shopping. I would like the item represented more to size,color,shape etc. A written representation would help. Delivery,payment,things like that were very simple and made the experience a good one. Thanks",4
3728,Quick game. Do not like that I need coins to play.,4
3729,works really well on glass (without falling)...,4
3730,"not the best product from this brand, the smell is a bit strong. would probably try another product by shea instead",4
3731,Not as comfy as my old ones.,4
3732,"Our miniature schnauzer LOVES this chew toy, but it only lasted about two weeks before he had it completely shredded down to a small lump (which he is still chewing). So a bit expensive to keep replacing them every two weeks...",4
3733,"These are very cute and the nylon is soft and stretchy. They are not all the same size band though. Some are tighter than others. And several of the bows are on white bands, which I didn't really notice in the picture, but they are still pretty. Unfortunately my baby doesn't like the thicker bands and keeps pulling these off. She doesn't mind the thin nylon bands.",4
3734,Was pretty good and arrived at a reasonable time,4
3735,"I really liked the book; the banter between Katy and Richard. It had an interesting story line, even though you knew where it was going. Well written; will read more by this author.",4
3736,seems sturdy enough though missing clips Update: Their customer service contacted me and kindly send a replacemt,4
3737,"The grill of my car was ripped off by a large something flying down the interstate so I needed a replacement. I was afraid after reading some reviews that this wouldn't fit, but it was perfect! I own a 2013 Corolla LE. I didn't put it on myself--I had a guy at a body shop do it for me--but it looked really easy. It just snapped right on in less than 5 minutes. I gave it a 4 star for the sturdiness because it does seem pretty flimsy (time and flying debris will tell), but over all I'm very satisfied that my car no longer has a gaping maw on the front now and that the price was reasonable.",4
3738,"Can't go wrong with these classics. I prefer Phase 10 over Uno, but both are fun.",4
3739,So many characters brought in so quickly O couldn't keep up. This is book 11 but I haven't read the others.I loved the way they worked together and believed a child's dream.,4
3740,"Really enjoyed the movie, specially AFTER getting past all the really dark, dreary, scary stuff at the beginning. Also the mommy issues... wtf?! DC. All the promotional stuff made me think it was finally a hero kids could watch, and within reason they can, but I do feel misled.. this is a grown up movie in a kids wrapper. Like the kid stuff was an after thought to lighten it up and broaden the audience. Again, I enjoyed the movie. I just wish it had been all fun",4
3741,My first use I felt many loose bristles and was concerned if these were knock off brush heads. Second use and all future times there was no issue. I never had experienced loose bristles with Sonicare brush heads.,4
3742,Bought for my granddaughter. She loves it,4
3743,I always order a larger size because it shrinks like crazy.,4
3744,"I like knowing it will not leave nasty glue all over my windows when I stop using the film when I finally get around to picking window treatments. I did have small air bubbles pop up around the edges when the temp went below freezing outside which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Not very noticeable, worth it for the film being easier to install and remove than the type with glue!",4
3745,"Though the top was a tad big on me, it wasn't enough to kill the overall vibe and look of the swimsuit. The bottoms fit perfectly - which I expected. So, overall, I was pleased with the purchase. The quality is also very good - which at times with Amazon purchases, can be a hit or a miss. I am a proud customer.",4
3746,The necklace was very nice and beautiful. We bought this for a cousin of ours that loves horses. Although it did not arrive on time. It was a day late and made us late for our cousins birthday party because we were waiting for it to arrive. I am only giving it 4 stars because it arrived late.,4
3747,"This is a gift and it looks nice and is packaged well. The only annoying thing is a big sticker that has the price, which is less than the listed price I paid which is even more annoying.",4
3748,Gave as a birthday gift for my best friend she loves it a lot. Utilizes a lot of drinks,4
3749,"This piece of equipment is doing a fine job, but it is not a shredder. The plant material needs to be dry before it is stuffed in. Damp leaves or stems will quickly plug up the chute because the blades are sturdy, not razor sharp. As long as plants are dried out, they whiz through and fall neatly into the collection bin. It is easy to load, especially if stems are stiff. I have used it on garden debris, not on twigs or small branches, but it should work equally well on them. One thing I particularly like is the ease of setup. I can chip any size bunch of plants and not wait until I have accumulated a huge pile. It is easy to wheel around, easy to disassemble for cleaning, quick to put back together because no tools are required for the job. I had to get used to the difference between a shredder and a chipper, but I will not have to sharpen this chipper's blades frequently.",4
3750,Nice for little league girls,4
3751,I love this dish but his water spout was a little bent on arrival despite good packaging.,4
3752,"I was super happy with these snow pants when I got them until I tried them on. I am 5'4"", 115 lbs and ordered the medium and they were very small on me. The material was great and loved the zippered pockets and built-in gaiters. I wanted to exchange them for a large, but they were three times the price which is unfortunately out of my budget. If you get these and they fit, you will love them!",4
3753,"Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install. I tried installing both ""bells"" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck. I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells. Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how ""weatherproof"" it is. I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.",4
3754,"Way better than my previous waterproof headphones. Various earplug sizes included to find the best fit for your ears. Together with 'half moon' fitting pieces a very good and secure fit was possible. Did an open water swim for > 1 hour and they didn't come out of my ears. Overall sound quality good, but low (bass) tones could be a bit better (personal preference).",4
3755,NICE PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY,4
3756,Arrival of order was as predicted; Havent used it yet as i ordered it for future use.,4
3757,Bought as a gift for my husband a couple years ago. He loved it and we‚Äôve used it when sending holidays cards via snail mail and such.,4
3758,"The quality is great, but the sizing is off. They run small. Also, make sure it fits loose on your male pup and that the elastic doesn‚Äôt rest directly on his privates..when it‚Äôs too tight, it hurts their privates and causes irritation, rash, bruising and scabbing. I learned the hard way. You will need to put an overnight maxi pad or something in there & wash them. I soak them in white vinegar & water before a cold water wash with free & clear detergent. Then hang dry. I bought a size Medium for my 12 lb. Toy Poodle and realized he needed a Large, so I am ordering again. I do recommend these, just go a size larger and don‚Äôt use long term.",4
3759,"It works but I have not checked it yet for RF interference with other electronics, radios, etc.",4
3760,"I thought this was just a Holy Grail mug, when it's actually a bunch of different quotes. Still a fun mug.",4
3761,Met all expectations except cleaning. Cap can not be disassembled for cleaning. Size and performance was excellent,4
3762,I like how easy it was to sit up and to use the kids love it know they can play for what that day is forever and not need to change out the battery‚Äôs just charge it and keep going and it doesn‚Äôt take long to charge either we love this about it.,4
3763,Well made but the screws could‚Äôve been a bit bigger for the plastic anchors.,4
3764,I've taken these before. The Vitamins are easy to digest.,4
3765,"It is a very simple shower head. Installation took 5 minutes. No leaks but water continues to drip for a long time after shutting off the shower. The movement of the shower holder is a little limited, which makes it more difficult to use in a small shower stall. The all metal design is appealing but the actual product is a little on the small side compared to other shower heads with plastic.",4
3766,"Great front bumper,little more than what I wanted to pay for a bumper. I wished it had more of a gloss black finish to match the new rear steel bumper from EAG that I had put on the rear. Also putting the fog lights in the bumper was VERY hard.",4
3767,"Changes color after long use, other than that it's great",4
3768,The color is closest to the pink that I wanted to match the pink shoes I'd bought. The blouse is nice & fits well enough.,4
3769,I have used this item daily for a month now. I have used up to 160 lb of resistance without a problem. It is very sturdy and a perfect length. The grips are comfortable and don‚Äôt slide. I have not had any issues. For the price this is a great value and great quality. I highly recommend this for any home gym with resistance bands. I would have given 5 stars if it didn‚Äôt have to be screwed together. A solid bar would have been better. It hasn‚Äôt caused me any problems I just tighten it every once in a while.,4
3770,Okay for price. Smaller than I thought.,4
3771,Like the product . Easy to apply. I have tried the others and nothing works as maybelline works for me.,4
3772,Worked perfectly. Does the job for a night or evening out. Very well supported. Adhesive/gel loosens after a few hours. The cups did seem a little small,4
3773,Nice looking glasses. I bought them for my father in-law. But they were too wide for his face. I wish they would have been smaller (narrower from side edge to side edge).,4
3774,"Some pens have a trouble with the ballpoint and ‚Äúrun out‚Äù... they don‚Äôt really bleed through and when they work, the colors are stunning and vibrant for good note taking.",4
3775,These leggings are super soft and true to size I host a big xmas eve so this is the perfect holiday cheer outfit while still remaining comfy while hosting amd cooking,4
3776,Excellent price and decent quality. üëç,4
3777,"So far so good, fits well, easy to connect! Just hope it holds up, will update review. I switched to leather because the orginal band gave me a rash :(",4
3778,Works great as long as you don‚Äôt sweat too much and aren‚Äôt in any humidity. The advice about the plastic wrap on your wrist really worked though! Product fit snug and lined up good with my watch.,4
3779,"Looks great, goes on and fits really nicely, as well as adds really good grip. Only thing I don't like is the buttons get pretty stiff once you put it on.",4
3780,I had to cut away some plastic pieces before I could use it with my weed whacker.,4
3781,"It‚Äôs cute, not so comfortable inside but was to fun to wear it in the movie feather.",4
3782,Really cute but runs a bit small,4
3783,Nice durable cover for someone prone to spills. Worth the price.,4
3784,I would to give them a 5 star. The balloons looks great but some of the balloons have small holes and this cause me to over work.,4
3785,"It's been a long time since I've read a good shifter fated mate book. I really liked this novel. I just wish we had more time with the couple after the full moon, to show that the sparks between them continued.",4
3786,I love these pads but they don't always break up in the wash you need to put them in first,4
3787,"Have not used the item yet, but price great and worth trying. Delivery is what is so great! Ordered one night and arrived the next evening! Fantastic!",4
3788,"The adapter does what it's supposed to and is a nice size. Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Biggest drawback is that when the adapter is plugged into the computer, it covers up the other USBC port making it impossible to charge the computer and use the adaptor at the same time. If you intend to use this adaptor to quickly transfer files back and forth then it's no big deal, but if you want to use it to back up your device, or edit files on a hard drive (something that you can't easily unplug w/o losing access to the files) then you should splurge the extra 5 bucks for one with a cord. Otherwise, you can't beat the price",4
3789,Noticeable difference in my nails with regular use. Good product! Highly recommended,4
3790,"Other than the buttons/holes are on the female side and it is a bit small for size large, it works.",4
3791,Was a good replacement for the original Fitbit band the broke.,4
3792,It is really very small. But it works,4
3793,I just started using the product so not sure how it will work. I have put it in my shampoo and it smells good.,4
3794,takes some getting used to.,4
3795,The stories are very well-written and very scary.,4
3796,"The clasp edges are a bit jagged so should not used with fine materials, which is what I needed it for. I had to be very careful in order to use.",4
3797,"I really liked my purchase, I think it's a bit difficult to connect to wifi display from my laptop.",4
3798,"This table is what I expected. The reason I can't give a five star is due to the legs being uneven, slightly and some of the holes for the bolts are a bit misaligned.",4
3799,"I love the feel of these pants. They are extremely comfortable and lightweight. I only wish they made them in a petite length. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 140 lbs at 6 months pregnant. The length of the pants are probably about 3 inches longer than what I need. I‚Äôll deal with it because they‚Äôre so comfortable, but would give 5 stars if they came in petite.",4
3800,"Super fast shipping. Easy to follow instructions. I barely got it growing and my cat was on it like white on rice. Only Gave it 4 stars because it didnt have quite enough potting soil in the container, i had to use a couple tablespoons to cover all the seeds. They send plenty of seeds. It grows super fast, but I may need to keep my cat away from it for a few days, because she chews it down to the nubs, and it needs to regrow.",4
3801,Great pieces of jewelry for the price. The 6mm is perfect for my tragus piercing. I gave four stars because I already lost one because it fell out! Other than that I am very happy with the purchase!,4
3802,"Good cost/value ratio...this is a LARGE bag of marshmallows! Would make a great snack for a bridal or baby shower. Package arrived very fresh. Only problem I had with this item was although they were quite tasty, they are just plain marshmallow flavor...I detected no trace of any strawberry flavoring as advertised.",4
3803,I like these earbuds a lot! I bought these about 6 or 7 months ago and they still work great today! With the thick cord it does not tangle that much. The sound quality is phenomenal! If you are a fan of loud music I would definitely recommend these.,4
3804,"Perform very well, no rust after 4 weeks. Does not have the 2 threaded holes to aid removal as OEM Rotors did. Fit over center hub has more clearance than OEM so removal should not be an issue years from now. Applied thin coat of never-sieze to mating area.",4
3805,"If you lost the one that came with the machine like I did, than this will be the replacement part you are looking for",4
3806,"don't win often, hard to save enough.",4
3807,Nice intro to taxes which for many are mystifying... definitely allows the reader understand more but without overload. Not as detailed as I‚Äôd prefer but a great intro to the topic .. well done,4
3808,"Well, Here's the deal...The product arrived on time and in good condition. Very nice packaging makes this perfect for gift wrapping and giving as present. It also come with a nice storage bag and glass case along with a lens cloth. These are plastic lenses...so use the protective cases or they will scratch just like any other plastic lens. These are of the blue blocker variety and they work! Nicely styled with lightweight aluminium alloy frames and comfortable nose pads. I plan to use them for shooting at the range, as well as for night driving. Good bang for the buck...if you protect them. There you have it.",4
3809,It picked up an hour long conversation between two people speaking with normal inside voices while concealed in a bag in a average sized room Could make out 98% of what was said.,4
3810,Love these but how do you dim them?,4
3811,"I‚Äôve only used a couple of them, but they seem to be a little lower quality than I‚Äôm used to. They also come in a flimsy cardboard box that won‚Äôt last long as a storage container. Decent product, but nothing special.",4
3812,"Works great, holds well but the key gets jammed a lot.",4
3813,Has a pretty good flavor to be tobacco free,4
3814,"taste is great, but these are bit too chewy for me..have had them before, just dont recall them ever being so thick n chewy..mite just be this flavor?",4
3815,I wee disappointed when the book ended so abruptly. I am looking forward to the next book in this series.,4
3816,These arrived healthy and green I attached them to rock and they took off beautiful Thanks seller,4
3817,i liked the way it works jar top spin off with ease,4
3818,"I liked that the leads were human enough to be wrong, yet strong enough to admit it. Character driven, fast paced, good story, and consistent. A very good read.",4
3819,Hopefully this will help with my health issues as I've read lots of good things about manuka honey.,4
3820,"i use this for enjoyment, im a grown man who likes toys, what can i say",4
3821,"Honestly, Initially, I had a challenge but believe it was more Amazon than XFasten. Though they did nothing other than fill the order from Amazon, they as a company took the action to ensure the problem was rectified and that I was happy. The tape is no longer relevant... any company that conducts business like this is a company to do business with.",4
3822,Super Cute and very quiet!!!!!,4
3823,Looked great and very solid....held up to my southern-in-laws' dense potato salad.,4
3824,"Works well, no bricking",4
3825,Slightly lightweight but otherwise perfect item. I do wish it had a weighted base cell when you are pulling out toilet paper that stuck can won't wobble around.,4
3826,"Bought two of these for international travel and have not been disappointed in the slightest. I'm currently sitting in a hotel room charging a Surface Pro 6 using the PD port and an adapter, plus an iPhone Xs Max from the QC 3.0 port, plus an iPhone 8 from one of the regular USB ports, and it's handling all three with no issue whatsoever. (It's pretty warm, I probably wouldn't leave the room with all that stuff plugged in, but if you're in the room anyway, it's no issue at all.)",4
3827,Exactly what you need to cut & strip fresh herbs and leafy greens. Easy to use and clean. Great safety tab that allows you to retract blades. Super easy to clean. Much better quality than others I‚Äôve used & broken. Plastic could be a tad thicker to make it last longer - but at this price it can‚Äôt be beat that‚Äôs my only quasi-complaint. Still ranks as one of the best I‚Äôve found after purchasing & breaking 2 other brands previous to this.,4
3828,"Love these lights. Lots of fun. We wore them when we went wine tasting before Christmas, and got raves. All I heard all day was, where did you get them? The only complaint is some of the bulbs were messed up. Not clear. Looked like glue was all over them.",4
3829,"My 97 year-old Dad could not use any phone but this one. His vision does not allow him to see the numbers on the buttons, so my daughter made up a large print chart with names that correspond to the buttons. It was easy to program and set up. It is so easy for him to lift the receiver and press one button to reach me. The only problem is that others, such as the aides at his assisted living facility, do not understand how to use it when it is on one-button program mode. I would have liked the amplified audio to be even louder, but that is mostly a problem because my father won't wear his hearing aids. This really helped solve a big problem for us, and I would buy it again, for sure.",4
3830,"I prefer the older model which is turned on by the pressure from the tire, rather than a button you have to press. It always seems to turn off automatically just before I'm ready to take the pressure on the next tire.",4
3831,They work but are thin. I wasn't surprised given the price.,4
3832,It was very nice! Niece enjoyed it very much! The heart in the wand popped out after dropping once but everything else was fine!,4
3833,"I am sure I would have really appreciated this tool, however this will not work with a 2002 Camry and the other years that have the same tie rods. Hope this helps anyone wondering.",4
3834,Looks great. Just make sure you are really close to your waist size,4
3835,"Mr. Oldman has played and created many, different characters. It is very difficult to tell it is him. He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors. Regarding his portrayal of Churchill, was very well done. The compressed time frame from May 10 to the 26th was well presented with the clock 7 turning pages... The scenery and costumes were excellent. Is poignant with today's pair of demi-gods holding world political position. Worth a look several times...worth thoughtful rumination... many more times",4
3836,I bought it for my boyfriend. He likes it. It does a good job moisturizing the hair but not as good as I hoped with the skin under his beard. Neutral smell.,4
3837,FASt shipping!!!!!!!!!,4
3838,I like the product. It is what I expected. I ordered a black can. I got grey.,4
3839,"Cute dress, it's a cotton fabric, so prone to lightening in color with washing. I got a large and it fits well (US size 12).",4
3840,Great fabric. Soft and washed well. It‚Äôs a little thin so a onsie would be needed in cold month.,4
3841,"I might've been happier if my guaranteed set wasn't hot pink, but overall it is what I expected: some weird color combos (lots of half/half and speckles), a few really excellent dice, several D6 with pips instead of numbers, and a few factory seconds that are chipped along the edges or have paint issues. I'm going to end up repainting the excessively ugly dice that were included, but overall definitely worth the cost and the fun of opening up the bag and seeing what you got.",4
3842,"I like the hair however I don't love the ends plus the hair had smell (so had to wash before installation), and it's a bit itching. But otherwise it looks great, I did the individual crochet braid method. I only used 5 and 1/2 packs.",4
3843,"This was a gift and the recipient has not used it yet, but it looks like it will do the job.",4
3844,"Looks real, sturdy and buttons press down. No sound & screen as is, but my daughter uses her imagination & loves this phone.",4
3845,"The black and green files seem to gunk up pretty quick, so not sure how long they'll last. Foam may be too soft? Buffing side kept catching the edge of my nails",4
3846,Great price. Glad I purchased.,4
3847,"Good fit. Had about a year now. Pull into garage in winter. Holding up so far, but the material does not seem like top of the line. So 4 stars. It's ok.",4
3848,We like the rack. There were some sharp pointed wires that needed to be cut before installing it.,4
3849,I'm not fond if the textured backdrops. Otherwise it works ok and for the price it's ok but a smooth surface would be better.,4
3850,"The paint spreads as it dries, keeping that in mind the smaller the design the better. We enjoyed the window cling option for the paint a few did not stick for some reason. In concept this kits seems like such a great idea, but thinking about the cost, time to dry, and how the paint spreads which can effect design, I wish it was priced cheaper. I say 3 stars but gave it one extra because at the end of the day it was a fun activity that we all got to do together as a family. Making memories that will last longer then the ornaments.",4
3851,"Great product, one of he flowers did fall off",4
3852,Not bad for the price,4
3853,My husband & I love this cup but I ordered the red / blue set. When they arrived it was red / black set. So we were a little disappointed. But overall we love this shaker cup & would definitely buy it again!!,4
3854,"We bought the crib from Buy Buy Baby without the bed side rails about 6 years ago. Glad to see the rails were still available. Very easy to convert, once I got the crib apart. The foot board doesn't feel super stable, but our kids have jumped on the bed and it's held fine. Now we just need our 3 year old to use *this* bed instead of *our* bed.",4
3855,"Fun read, great lead characters. Story got a bit repetitive about 75% in but got better again.",4
3856,"It works great, but lots of water comes out. Would be nice if that could be adjusted.",4
3857,Good holder all around. Only thing I didn't love was the Plastic Clip seems cheap.,4
3858,Definitely works for a smaller scale yard. I do wish it came with more nozzles.,4
3859,Material is cheaper than expected but ok for a crib skirt.,4
3860,"Well made, very durable. Would get five stars if it had some padding on shoulder straps.",4
3861,"No issues with the cartridges, works just like the originals, but substantially less money. Recommend.",4
3862,"The product looks as expected, the only downside is it‚Äôs flat. The picture makes it seem that hat had more depth. Meaning it more poking out you have to actually pull out Piece on the hat.",4
3863,"Whiplash. Product is comfortable, easy to wear.",4
3864,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8, 150lbs, 34D, and bought a M. This almost worked! The suit is great quality, but the boob area (the strap connecting the top across the boobs) isn‚Äôt quite right for me. If you‚Äôre on the fence and don‚Äôt mind possible returns, buy it and test it out.",4
3865,A good protection glass. It worked for about 2 years. Then the glass started cracking around the home button. I wrote the company to sent me a replacement and they did. I'm happy with their customer service!,4
3866,"The best suspenders I've had so far. Sometimes the left side does not hold properly, but in general, they are still the best.",4
3867,"I don't know what the 1.25"" dremel diamond wheel can do compared to these smaller wheels, but three of them cut through 2 feet of 1/2"" thick porcelain tile, which comparatively, is $3 worth of material as opposed to $25 for one dremel wheel.",4
3868,Good price and quality. Delivered as promised in two days.,4
3869,Sound quality and connectivity is great. I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 for battery life. Other than that I love it.,4
3870,"I like my rock, but it doesn't have any tabs or holes to use the two provided anchors. I will drill my own, but feel others should know,",4
3871,The small usb is incredibly hard to plug in. Too tight and have to wiggle it on. Could be the pc since it‚Äôs my only usb-c i can test it on. Works when plugged in. Recognized right away. Very sturdy and solid casing.,4
3872,I really like the product but the wrong color was delivered. I got a green one and ordered the rose gold.,4
3873,"Nice dress. Needed a size larger, but wearable.",4
3874,Somewhat small. but good material.,4
3875,Decent rack for th e price - my only complaint is has a bolt instead of hitch pin on receiver. Bought a standard hitch pin - but too big for rack. is is safe to drill out holes to accommodate the pin?,4
3876,"I find this product to be light weight & has strong sewing stitches. It seemed well made and sturdy. My son, 21 yrs old, likes it a lot. His only concern are the clips that came with this product. My sons said, ‚Äò not so confident to hold his 210lbs body frame. Over all, he likes it & stated he would not hesitate to give this product a ‚Äò solid Four Stars!",4
3877,"This can be dressed up or down, very versatile. Only downfall is the chain is too long for my wrist and gets in the way when driving.",4
3878,"I am a 70 year old woman and put this together in about 15 - 20 minutes. We have two other bed frames like this one and they are both heavier duty than this one. That being said, this one is sturdy enough and solid when we use it. Would give 5 stars if it was not bolted together. Our others just unfolded out of the carton with no wrench needed. Welded is better, but this one is strong and solid so far. Price mattered on this purchase and it is excellent value for the money.",4
3879,The lock was very easy to install. I would give it 5 stars if 1) it didn't take as long to recognize your home and connect/unlock the door and 2) the apps auto-unlock zone wasn't so large as when leaving my town i travel on a road that's back in range after i leave the house so it wants to unlock the door again.,4
3880,So my Apple Watch band came today and I must say I‚Äôm very impressed with the product I had no problems tanking my old bands off it was very easy to put on the only problem I‚Äôm having is that some of the glitter is falling off the band but over all I like itb,4
3881,I use Streamlight flashlights at work everyday as a professional aircraft mechanic on night shift. I bought this because of brand name but not for my job. This is strictly the well made Home use variety of head lamp. These type of LEDs cast wide light not focused beam. The 3 brightness is handy for everything from night light reading a book in hospital room with sick relative to full bright for under the hood work in the garage or crawling underneath car.,4
3882,"So far, so good. One time it stopped charging my phone after plugging in the audio, but I just had to disconnect and reconnect the device, then all worked together.",4
3883,I love this ring. It is beautiful. The only downside is it is very easy to knock off one of the stones. I lost the red stone the first day I wore it. I still wear the ring and still get compliments on it.,4
3884,"Okay, to be fair I am a monkey when it comes to things like this and it is why I ordered a two pack. The first one was practice! I made it work on try two, so people with better skills than I should be just fine with the product. I penalized the product one star as I saw one at the phone store with a jig for aligning the protection screen. It would probably only take me one if I had one less thing to worry about! All in all happy with the price and it works well.",4
3885,"Before purchasing and after receipt, I watched the video which was very helpful for setup. The stand is well made and all went together as per video. I have some difficulty in setting my phone on the stand. Not a case issue ‚Ä¶ the setting of the lightning cable seems a bit off straight. The support for the phone is adjustable to accommodate for different case thicknesses ‚Ä¶ it is the slight misalignment of the cable that seems the issue. I have set and reset. Not a deal breaker, just takes a bit of finagling to set the phone. All else works well. The only other ""issue"" is ‚Ä¶ there are still 3 cables out the back of the unit. Three white cables. I bought a black unit. I'm trying another stand and am on the lookout for a cable wrangler - probably a solvable problem. If nothing else, I can wrap the cables in black electric tape. Honestly, there does not seem to be 1 perfect solution, but what I really like about this stand is how it holds the watch.",4
3886,The sound is more crisp then the less expensive version. I hope they last...,4
3887,"It came right on time, looks fantastic. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price a little to high but it supposed to be handmade so it balances it off.",4
3888,It is as it looks. Good quality metal. But not cheap,4
3889,Has some small pebbles in it but it‚Äôs not made for consumption so I figured may have some in it.,4
3890,"I always order these and love them. Haven't worn these yet, but know they will fit. They always have.",4
3891,"Works and is pretty cheap. Had issues with ones before. The picture is not what you get though, you get a newer version.",4
3892,Work great but get a little warm!,4
3893,I like the product very much. But the pump on the bottle never worked. I‚Äôve had to unscrew the top every time I used it.,4
3894,I think it work good. I could tell the difference before and after application.,4
3895,My sister has the real discontinued one... this one smells very similar but not as strong of a scent,4
3896,I like these a lot. If I could change anything about the product I would rather the edges to be over edged. Other than that I would order again.,4
3897,It‚Äôs a nice product to keep around the house when you want a quick and easy snack. I enjoyed this very much and it is the right size bag and stays good windshield for a couple days. Would re-by in a second.,4
3898,I like it the only thing is I think it. Would have been better if it was in book four.,4
3899,"Doesn't really work well on certain ants, but it arrived quickly and works overall.",4
3900,should come with the glue to hold it in place,4
3901,This sheet was just what I was looking for. I found the elastic unnecessary for my use and cut it off on one corner. Fits perfectly on my pillow top mattress.,4
3902,I enjoyed this book and plan to read it to our 2nd grade class.,4
3903,The air filter keeps sliding off the band is not wide enough to hold it on.,4
3904,"Marker runs out quickly, wish you could buy replacement markers",4
3905,"I do like this product a lot. I set the 7 programs daily for my pool pump in Florida, where during the summer the pump has to run 8 hours each day to prevent algae growth. With this timer I can run the pump with intervals during the 24 hours of each day, such that the pool water is never sitting still for long times. I took off one star, because it was hard to cut the holes to the right size for the electrical connections. One of the pre-marked holes broke off to a bigger size than I needed.",4
3906,They seem fine so far,4
3907,Bought as a gift and it was a big hit. I do kind of wish the cats hands were slightly bigger.,4
3908,This book was hard to put down. Fast paced and action packed. A book to enjoy.,4
3909,"Sandals are cute, I was expecting a richer color, but they are still cute(Olive Green). They are true to size. I wear a 10, and ordered my size, the width is goid as well. Delivery was fast. My only complaint is the shoe does rub against the top of my foot, by the buckle. I'm sure I will have to put a bandaid there, to keep from getting a blister, but I am going to keep them",4
3910,"The cover and shams look as pictured. Very soft and comfortable. Its very delicate, I tore a hole by the zipper very easily. I did not return cover because it was super cheap.",4
3911,"Love these. The lamps are so GREAT. They come in different sizes. I have one in my children's room and it give the softest soothing light. I have the other in the kitchen, which really makes it seem calm and relaxing in our home when it's the only or one of the only lights on any time of day. The candle holders are a different story. One of them is cut to hold a tea light and the other is cut too small so I actually can't do anything with it.",4
3912,Discreet and cute! Purrrfect little travel companion. It is a little more powerful than expected! Lots of different speed/ massage patterns. The charge lasts a long time! I like that it had a soft texture and I'd waterproof!,4
3913,"Wish the picture was brighter. Doesn't matter how sunny it is out, the picture looks dark. Also the mirror wiggles and bounces around some, but not terrible.",4
3914,I used this while attending a music festival a few months ago. It worked great! No seats? No problem! No standing for hours with this cane!,4
3915,I love Soda product! These ran a little small for me! Wish they worked because I really liked them!,4
3916,Very nice color. Good quality the price we paid for.,4
3917,pointy but satisfying,4
3918,The quality was not a strong as I thought. My phone did get hot when charging. But it shuts off when reacts 100%,4
3919,"Super cute but a little long, they don't stay in place and I have to constantly adjust them probably due to the length of them. They are very lovely however and I j\hope to be able to adjust them to fit.",4
3920,These are great for blocking out light but they are plastic tracks and are not going to look like professional blind tracks. You get what you pay for. They were definitely easy to install and serve their purpose.,4
3921,These fit almost perfectly in the bottom of the NuWave oven.,4
3922,"This smells and cleans like windex, only it comes in a form of foam. Yes no doubt it cleans well, but I cannot say it‚Äôs something special.",4
3923,"My grand daughter loved these boots. She put them on and would not take them off. They are really cute and must be comfortable for her. The price I paid was too expensive for a child's house shoes, She will grow out of them before I get my money's worth. Four stars only because of the price.",4
3924,Works as advertised. Very satisfied.,4
3925,You ran out of black in my size,4
3926,Loved the product but it didn ‚Äòt fit the chair and it was returned for refund.,4
3927,"I had to replace my Klipsch sound bar. That one had decent sound but too many quirks and irritations so it had to go. This Yamaha sound bar has great sound. My father in law doesn't hear so good and he can hear the voices without shaking the house. Movies and football games come through great with full rich sound. A huge upgrade from regular tv speakers, it's easily as good as my more expensive prior sound bar. Setup was a breeze as was doing the update with a sub drive. I definitely recommend taking the time to do the update, it's easy and made a big difference. If you can't afford to drop the cash on a full surround system this is awfully good for just a sound bar and sub.",4
3928,"Based on the reviews and the seller‚Äôs advice, I sized up to a M when I normally wear an XS/S. Unfortunately, the stitching on the shoulder of the M far surpasses my petite, narrow shoulders, so it sticks waaaay out and makes me look like a football player. When I bunched the material to fit my shoulder, it looked perfect. Therefore, even though this one didn‚Äôt work for me, I think it‚Äôll be great when I return it for my true size. Not sure why everyone says to size up, as there is a plenty of extra material... It‚Äôs made to be a baggy crop top. Unless you have extra broad shoulders, just order your real size so that it‚Äôs a baggy crop top that properly fits and looks good.",4
3929,Dawson gives strong evidence for how our thoughts shapes our reality and influences everyone around us. And he offers more online information at the end of each chapter. I do wish that he included more guidance about his meditations in the book.,4
3930,"Good value and well made, it did not come with a front screen protector.",4
3931,"Loved the color, price and fast shipping. I have only worn them in the yard and around the house to see if they would rub. They have not.",4
3932,The shoe is excellent for trail running but runs half a size to small,4
3933,I wear glasses for daily vision. I cannot wear this headband with my glasses. Otherwise it works quite well.,4
3934,This is a beautiful good quality nice bangle! but for my small wrist it won't stay in one place it will definitely fits for someone who has a medium sized wrist. So I'll keep this nice gift to give to my family who can use it.,4
3935,"These socks have good compression, but I'm not a huge fan of how itchy they are. I understand they need to have the tightness, which cotton can't do, but I really hoped they would be a bit softer. I got them for my varicose veins, especially a problem one on my left leg, which they do what I need them for.",4
3936,"it looks good and gives a nice style, however i thought the butterflies are bigger than the real product, it's a bit smaller than pictures.",4
3937,Consistently received about 25 channels on each of the televisions in my home with this antenna. The UHF channels seemed to come in clearer in my area. Great picture. Looking forward to free tv.,4
3938,I got the Phone system on time and in good shape. It was what I ordered and in good shape.,4
3939,Well this is not really a review. I purchased these batteries trusting the reviews already left for these batteries. I am very impressed with the cases that come with the batteries. The cases come with a rubber seal beneath the covers. So far so good üëç,4
3940,"Just wished it was a lil more snug, I got a medium cuz I'm a size 9 1/2",4
3941,I was leery due to the last book dragging but this book is an exciting read! Love the story! My only complaint is I enjoy when Anita fully bonds with a new lover. Those bonds are what have kept me reading. I'll probably still buy the next book.,4
3942,my baby did came with a missing face plate but is still a very cool pop,4
3943,"SUPER cute, design was just as pictured. Thin, you can see the print on the other side but not a deal breaker since its SO cute!",4
3944,"I do love these chair socks. They match the color of our dining chairs. But they don‚Äôt always stay put. I‚Äôve found if you have a chair (or two) that is used more frequently, being pulled in and out from under the table, they weaken the material and slide off the leg. I still continue to use the socks because they are keeping my hardwood floors from scratching but I wish they would have a bit more elastic in them to stay put on the legs.",4
3945,"I was looking for a watch that can do fitness tracking and give notifications from cell phone, monitoring heart rate, alarm but don't want to spend too much money and I found this great watch. it's comfortable to wear all day long. Battery last for days. I give this review a 4 stars because the actual screen is smaller than it looks.",4
3946,These have been good sheets. Haven't seen any issues with them so far.,4
3947,Great tank! I give it 4 stars only because there is a logo at the hem so it can only be worn with certain tops or as athleisure wear. Fabric and fit are great.,4
3948,made a pie...all loved it...,4
3949,"I like the color, but wish there was more coverage. I have a full size car and the base does not cover all of the seats. And I like the pockets at the base of cover a lot.",4
3950,I just received the pills and you already want a review of how they work. Let me use them and I will come back and update my review.,4
3951,Writing is too small to read otherwise a beautiful puzzle.,4
3952,"This is a great hose and it fits my needs perfectly. Unfortunately the nozzle will come off somewhat frequently, though it is easy to screw/pop back on.",4
3953,"It‚Äôs thin enough where my son doesn‚Äôt automatically slide down in his crib and it doesn‚Äôt make him tall enough to try to climb out, which was a worry with thicker wedges. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs making a difference reflux wise yet because he‚Äôs been getting colds and stomach bugs a lot, so I didn‚Äôt give it five stars. He does seem to be waking and coughing less in in sleep compared to before, but I can‚Äôt attribute it to the wedge just yet.",4
3954,"Self-taught is the limit of my desire to play guitar. I want to pick it up and string out few clean notes/tunes, not be some virtuoso guitar god. This got me past the hump of plucking along with YouTube videos and gave me a method of playing and a system that ""scored"" my results as getting better and where I needed work. The game lets you move around and work on the skills you are interested in. The cable is top notch and I'm really happy with this game.",4
3955,Great unit.. led are really bring... Outlet are all working..,4
3956,It fits as a true medium,4
3957,"It came pretty fast. Much fast then they said it would come. But it did however look very cheap. But the person I gave it to, still liked it!",4
3958,"I bought this a couple months ago to be prepared for the summer, and when I went to use it this week it doesn‚Äôt work! I have tried both batteries and neither seem to charge. It turned on one time for about 5 minutes and nothing since. What a disappointment! Do not buy, it‚Äôs a waste of money! Update: shortly after reading my review the company reached out to me and sent me TWO replacements that have been working great! I greatly appreciate them replacing it free of charge!",4
3959,Yes it's big but it makes it easier to use,4
3960,"nice ointment, a bit runny but moisturizes well. There just a few ingredients and they are all natural. no preservatives. I recommend this product!",4
3961,"Quality isn't top notch, but the long life of the ink and cost is good.",4
3962,"The GO was actually super awkward to use before I got the case. Now I just flip it open and the floppy keyboard is stable on my lap, I can just use the computer without fiddling with setup so the keyboard didn't fall off the tablet. It's so much better I don't know why it doesn't come with a sturdy case from Microsoft.",4
3963,Just what we needed for our banquet.,4
3964,"Dear Santa: Children‚Äôs Christmas Letters and Wish Lists, 1870 ‚Äì 1920 by Chronicle Books What I like about this book are many things. Not only for children but adults as there is so much history to learn about. love that they show color photos of a scene during the book. So much history: how the Santa letter came about over the years, the origins of Santa. Each section of years has a summary and toy terminology and the charm of children, living history section and a don't miss area before it gets into the letters. Amazing to learn when tinker toys were invented among other toys that we in our 60's remember. So many fond memories over the years, what a treasure this book is.",4
3965,Bought it to put in the cabinet to store my platters. Works perfectly for that purpose,4
3966,Was not as ‚Äútall‚Äù as expected. But it looks great. Very sticky.,4
3967,"The item arrived as advertised except for the small dent. Would give 5 stars, but...the dent.",4
3968,"The bar was too short for my liking, but the colors are so fun & bright I just got a longer bar & they were better (:",4
3969,These are really cute. Fit my 1 year olds head and she will even leave it on for a few minutes! I was disappointed that the blue color is actually more of a dark teal and the red color is actually more of a burnt orange. I'm having a hard time matching these to her clothing.,4
3970,I didn't really like the rough texture of the mesh against my feet but the sole is comfortable and it's a good water shoe.,4
3971,Soft and nice. Fits perfectly.,4
3972,It was very over priced.,4
3973,"How to go over the directions a couple of times but once done , easy , Best to shake them off outside after cutting. ! They will shed. Multi",4
3974,"Worked really well for my son, just okay for me. Definitely made our feet softer.",4
3975,Fits and works in the bathroom fan housing it is supposed to fit in. Good deal.,4
3976,I do love these but we returned them because they are too narrow for my daughters foot.,4
3977,I like the price the most,4
3978,Love the shirt. I wish the fabric of the shirt was softer.... a little rough. Overall good shirt,4
3979,It‚Äôs more red than shown. Color is not true to picture. This is a very cherry wood.,4
3980,"The problem is any missing instructions what to do with the product after arrival. It smells horribly, it colours all water yellow. From web I found that I should soak it for a long time (in my case I soaked it for 3 days replacing water several times). This removes significant amount of colouring and smell. Then you should use it empty. You will see how much yellow the water under the steamer is. If it is still quite a lot and the steamer smells, keep soaking, if it is just tinted with yellow and the smell is very faint, steam empty steamer several times and soak after each steaming. (i do not know if the instructions are correct but this is what I found by trial and error. Finally, when you cook food, always put baking paper under it. Especially if you steam fish. After steaming, I suggest soaking for half an hour in water. Soaking = immerse fully in water.",4
3981,Cute and can change colors with outfits. Gave 4 stars because they tend to loosen up after wearing a while.,4
3982,Nice Thai Cashew Curry with the hot curry and vegetables. Quick meal if you add your own rice. Microwave in a minute.,4
3983,"Bought for my arthritic grandma. She likes it just fine, but I regret not buying the multi-band, multi-handle pack.",4
3984,I generate monthly billings for several companies and the double window does save time in processing.,4
3985,I just had surgery on my shoulder AND my foot. This package could not be more perfect. I've been able to increase my range of motion and mobility in my arm because I can do the exercises at home and not just twice a week with the physical therapist. I plan on using these when I get back into the gym too.,4
3986,Pretty design. Looks great on rose gold phone! I‚Äôve dropped my phone several times and it‚Äôs held up well.,4
3987,Exactly as advertised. Shipped accordingly and fit perfectly. Great item.,4
3988,They we're quick to install and felt like they were of quality the ones for the Elite controller are a more high grade but these work just fine for adapting a controller for a smaller trigger pull,4
3989,"Bought this for my wife and she likes it. So far, it has held up well but then she does not use her cell phone like I do.",4
3990,"I think these are about 1/2 inch too short to be very comfortable in my fairly large hands, but the surfaces are nice as are the fittings.",4
3991,"The brush works fine for dishes, and for cleaning cast iron cookware. The bristles will take whatever form they were last dried in, so should be reformed after each use to avoid having the brush go flat. I have used other brushes which better retain their form.",4
3992,So far everything is working.,4
3993,"We ordered this set for our Switch because it was a good balance between the price of wired controllers (cheap) and functionality of wireless. Overall the controller works great - good ergonomics, buttons are satisfying, sticks are usable, gyro seems to work, low latency. My only complaints : 1) the rumble is really, really extreme. So much rumble. Some kind of setting to turn it down would be great. 2) the binding procedure was a little weird, but well-explained in the (marginally) translated instructions. Would definitely recommend if you need a couple extra controllers for when friends come over. For a daily driver or to be more pro, some of the more expensive options might be better.",4
3994,"Worked well, i have to increase the volume a bit, but quality is fair and works. I used it on my 2008 4runner",4
3995,I use this for bedtime. It helps everyone sleep better.,4
3996,"the purple in particular makes an excellent blush, but it goes on much lighter than I wanted it too even if you sit there packing it in for a long time. I use a white NYX eye primer so it goes on VERY pastel and hold up pretty well, I haven't tried getting it wet yet but that may make for thicker application.",4
3997,These are great quality! The only Issue is that my daughter has wide feet so the elastic on top was hurting her a bit. I love these but they didn't work out for her. If your toddler has wide feet I would go a different route. But aside from that the canvas material was really comfortable for her and they looked adorable.,4
3998,"Very good spatula, it gets the job done. There is/was a slight wobble in handle, so the tolerance in the connection of the wooden handle to the metal body could stand to be tightened. Other than that, fantastic spatula.",4
3999,"Easy setup with bluetooth to your phone, and clear instructions provided. This is my second time buying this product, my first one had the USB cable snap off at the Y with almost a year of constant use, could have been my fault due to heavy use. Only complaint is that it is slightly quieter than max volume with a regular aux cord.",4
4000,Shipped fast. Great product,5
4001,The flavor was great.,5
4002,My 2-year old grandson loves this series. Pictures are great; nice sturdy board book that is easy for him to use. He asks for this book to be read over and over.,5
4003,"No taboo here, just a May -October romance. And what a romance! So well written, you could just feel how close these two friends are. I have to admit it made me a pile of mush.",5
4004,This replacement band is perfect. Great quality and durable. Excellent price and customer service!,5
4005,"Best purchase I have ever made!!! This mirror is amazing! I highly recommend this product super sturdy, lighting is perfect, super cute and easy to use! I‚Äôm recommending this to all my co workers! I‚Äôm honestly thinking about buying a second one for myself and a couple for Christmas gifts (:",5
4006,Comfortable and worth the purchase,5
4007,"This is definitely the shampoo the Stars use. My hair is never smelt better or felt softer in my entire life. I felt like a model walking down the street with my hair bouncing and blowing in the wind. I highly recommend this product. I did not use it for a drug test, I just wanted to see if it would clean out the impurities from my hair which it seems to have done.",5
4008,Whirpool washer is much better now. These things are a little tricky to install - you need two people.,5
4009,Dog loves it and I am confident that she will not run around in the car,5
4010,"It‚Äôs a great book, talks about things we take for granted when we‚Äôre buying a house, or getting a new job. It gives great advices, I have recommended this book to a handful of people. It‚Äôs easy to read short and they go straight to the point. Loved it!",5
4011,So far so good. They fit my daughter just right and look very nice.,5
4012,Very handy to have around,5
4013,These are perfect paper Coffee cups! I love the sleek white design! It is also the perfect size for great coffee on top!,5
4014,Quick delivery and interesting how the bugs glow with this,5
4015,"I absolutely love the color of this fountain pen! My fountain ink refills fit perfectly in the pen. My only complaint is that the pen seems to leak at times, running the risk of ruining clothing and getting all over my hands.",5
4016,Super cute. Got here fast.,5
4017,I like the size and the grey color. It is a replacement for an old stool just like this that was just too trashed looking to keep in my new laundry room :),5
4018,"Love these lamps! They have a small foot print on my night stand, the charger works good, they take standard size bulbs, and the design is classy and simple, we bought 2 for or bedroom.",5
4019,"I have taken this on a weeks vacation and so far I love it! The hardware seems sturdy and the material feels like good quality. Lots of space and feels well-supported as a backpack. I'm a female, 5' 7"", and was a little worried it would swallow me but it's been great. Taking it to Iceland in a few months, and I think it will be perfect. Update: carried only this bag for a week in Iceland in January, still going strong!",5
4020,A good purchase. The length and style of this necklace are all ok to me. I like the sterling silver things and the big reason to buy is that I really like its beautiful pendant.,5
4021,"At first, when I opened the package, I was shocked as to how long one of the pairs was. (I had purchased two different ones). The length was not a problem - and in fact complimented my face and accented my neck. I love how light they are. I hope to purchase more!",5
4022,"This tool is relatively inexpensive compared to other brands, but it gets the job done without any issues, make sure to keep the treads properly lubricated while using this tool to protect the treads and for longevity. Recommended to anyone looking for a decent quality tool to remove and install wheel bearings in your ride. Used on a 2006 HD Night Train.",5
4023,"Exactly as they show in the pictures! They run big, you should consider ordering half or one size less.",5
4024,"This series has super wide-angle lens, macro lens, fisheye lens, zoom lens, whether it is a wide panorama in the tour, or shooting tiny animals without problems. There is also a protective box that can be hand-held, and it is light and easy to go to photography at any time.",5
4025,Bought this for my grandson,5
4026,my 5 pound maltipoo loves it very comfortable!!!,5
4027,Love the flavor and the energy i get after drinking this :),5
4028,"It's study and lightweight. Perfect for taking my projects on vacation and keeping everything organized, which is why I bought it. The storage on top is a little awkward for my longer needles, with the diagonal zipper, but all in all I have no complaints. My project was small and I was able to fit more yarn in the back storage pocket for additional projects/needles. The carrying handle is thin, but sturdy and does the job.",5
4029,I absolutely love this mask! Snorkeled in Mexico and everything was so clear! No fogging at all! I read a lot of reviews and researched other masks first before buying this one. This mask gives a realistic panoramic view and I felt so much more comfortable breathing normally rather than traditional snorkel. Just do it.,5
4030,"It is very sensitive when measuring, small and portable, convenient to use when going out, of good quality, and very sanitary to use, without worrying about the risk of unclean and contact with bacteria.Data is also relatively accurate, a good helper in the kitchen, it is worth buying.",5
4031,The whole shoes are fluffy. The texture of the fabric is soft. It feels so comfortable. It is especially warm. The size is just right. I really like it~~~!!!,5
4032,"Got this for a coworker - bright colors, good quality, and she started using it immediately!",5
4033,"Outstanding, exceed my expectations!",5
4034,I bought these for under dresses and they are perfect for that. I did size up to a large instead of a medium because they run small. They hit the knees on me but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11‚Äù,5
4035,"Works very well, easy install",5
4036,I absolutely love it. It's TRUE to size. I wear a 12 and purchased a LG. Perfect fit,5
4037,"Easy to use, quick and mostly painless!",5
4038,"This pan is amazing. I love the size and the nonstick coating. The lid sits nicely. It is perfect for so many things. We love it for a breakfast skillet and mix hashbrowns, eggs, onions, green peppers and bacon or ham for a one skillet breakfast. Clean up is a cinch.",5
4039,"Excellent workmanship, beautiful appearance, and just the right size, installation is simple, special and stable. It can put a lot of things such as the usual utensils, dishes, and cups however, the biggest advantage is that it can save space.",5
4040,"Everything I been looking for in a washcloth. Not to light perfect weight, the size is perfect and the durability is wonderful. They feel so soft after being washed the first time. Will definitely be buying again for sure.",5
4041,"Essential reading for those who want to learn how to best contribute to redirecting the trajectory of humanity. These lessons should be taught to every educator, government official, CEO, college student, and ambitious teenager.",5

4043,Good Quality and compact.,5
4044,I bought these sheets because i was looking for a brand new clean pair of sheets that where definitely cheap but good quality and i have found them they are the best sheets white just always looks so clean and i could say i can impress females because they are so easy to wash and how i said soft. i have had my pair of sheets for a little over 3 months and no regrets i love the sheets they have been washed more then 10 times already and still like brand new as i wash them more and more the softer they get i recommend the sheets to everyone besides the price is unbeatable they are phenomenal. i am about to purchase about 3 more pair of sheets for the guest room and for my roommate,5
4045,I first tried this in a one time use packet I got from Walmart and I was hooked. It makes my hair super soft and I recommend it to all my friends. I use it 2 times a week after I use my castor oil. Definitely notice my hair shiner. üëçüëçüëç,5
4046,The shirt is well designed and fits well. The color is really good,5
4047,Exactly what I expected!,5
4048,"I found these diapers after another diaper I bought leaked all the way through. These diapers are great and made our life so much easier. We use an adult bladder protection pad on the inside so that we don't have to wash the diapers so often. We just throw away the liner pads and put the diaper back on with a new pad. Sometimes the pad soaks through to the diaper, but the diaper has never leaked.",5
4049,Exactly what I was looking for.,5

4053,The jacket was just as we expected. Thank you.,5
4054,"Received the new band and was able to install in seconds. Band appears to be much sturdier than what came with the original fitbit. Original band would fall apart under stress, this one stays put so you don't risk losing your fitbit.",5
4055,This is a good product. Would definitely purchase again.,5
4056,"First off, it's in my favorite color! They have a great choice of colors, and orange is mine. It arrived in great shape and is a thing of beauty. I got tired of my ex wife waxing lyrical about her stupid Yeti (in blah stainless steel), so I did the ice test: eight ice cubes in each tumbler, same temperature, side by side. The swig actually had slightly less melted ice than her Yeti, so that's a victory for team Swig! I also bought the can cooler, and as I go along, will purchase all of the Swig products in orange. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this product!",5
4057,Only real problem is that people can hear the noise from your headset but besides that perfect,5
4058,"I wasn‚Äôt impressed with the size of the container for the price, until I tried it! I‚Äôm a Postal worker, and my fingertips and cuticles were always getting cuts in them due to all the paper I touch drying my hands out. I started using this two weeks ago and they are now soft and healed over! I‚Äôm impressed!",5
4059,Easy to peel and stick. They don't fall off.,5
4060,I am great fan of Jake Needham's books. And this novel is an example of why I enjoy how I enjoy them. The plot flows. And it is very readable. And realistic. Needham is one of the few authors that buy as soon as they are published. Do yourself a favor and buy this book.,5
4061,I use them for mountain biking fell twice with them on both times glad I had put them on great protection,5

That makes me happy!!!",5

Now he sits on the couch for an hour each night wearing these, wondering why we never heard of these before!

I distribute all over my face and then pat in with my hands to get the best results. I use Retin-A for acne and need a sunscreen everyday for multiple applications and I've done 3-4 applications and had it still look nice on my face.

4185,"Update after 3 months: Still great. Comfortable & fits well. Just the slightest sign of wear on edge near point of attachment. No signs of wear along the band or around the buckle. Very happy. ~~~~~ Original review: I bought the Silver Swirls pattern-- the one with the spirals & I wear it all the time, including workouts. I've had it only for a week, but so far am very happy with it. The pictures accurately show the color & pattern. The pattern wraps over the edge of the band & goes a little way onto the back, so it doesn't look like something that's just stamped on the outside. A week is too short to know, but the pattern seems to be resistant to scraping off or fading. I'm not about to scrape it to find out, but may update the review later. The buckle appears identical to the brand name band that came with the Charge 2. I buckle & unbuckle pretty often to tighten the band for exercise. So far there aren't any wear marks around the buckle. All in all a good deal.",5
4186,This was a perfect wrap for my outfit that I wore to a wedding!,5

4266,Good material. Fits as expected. Soft and comfortable to wear. I would recommend it.,5
4267,"The case and disc were clean when I got them. No cracks to the case and the game worked as needed. The game itself is wonderful, full of adventure. There isn't much in replay value per se, yet most of the players find themselves going back for more, if only to level up their characters.",5
4268,This arrived on time and was packaged nicely which I appreciate.,5
4269,"The first lamp I purchased was defective, kept turning on its self. I sent back for a replacement without an issue, the new one came and works perfectly, looks great and adds character to the room.",5

4276,"This so so much better than swallowing 4 pills. The scoop that comes in really helps, and I just mix it with water and there's really no taste. I've done 1 month of the pills and 1 month of the powder and I believe I'm seeing results already!",5
4277,These smell fantastic and burn an extremely long time (some over an hour!) The scents are strong and linger many hours! Extremely happy with these!,5

4286,"I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants. I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only. I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself. I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants. The lights are small! When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.",5
4287,"Great little speaker! The sound was loud and clear. I‚Äôve had others that didn‚Äôt sound good when you turned the volume up, no problems with this one. It also paired quickly with my phone. Would definitely recommend.",5

4290,Perfect quality my sis loved them!,5
4291,"I bought this set to go in my sunroom. I love the aged look; it doesn't show dirt as easy as some rugs I have had. They are very sturdy and the colors are just beautiful. I have received so many compliments on the rugs. The gripper back on all the rugs hold securely in place with normal traffic. Overall this is a beautiful, functional set.",5
4292,Water pump works perfectly and arrived as promised.,5
4293,Great variety. Thank you.,5
4294,Worked great on my clients edges. If you combine it with too many products though it could turn white so just be careful,5

4296,"My husband is picky about his underwear, but he loves these! They run a little small. My hubby wears M, but I bought these in L. And they fit him perfect. He says the best thing about them (besides comfort, obviously) is the solid piece in the front. There‚Äôs no flap. I have always had to hand-sew the flaps closed on all his other underwear. But, not anymore. I love Starter!",5
4297,Great quality but too wide to fit BBQ Galore Grand Turbo 4 burner with 2 searing bars.,5
4298,These little lights are awesome. They put off a nice amount of light. And you can put them ANYWHERE! I have put one in the pantry. Another in my linen closet. Another one right next to my bed for when I get up in the middle of the night. Have only had them about a month but so far so good!,5

4309,". I measured for an extra large and I find it a bit too tight for long term wear but IS a quality and great product. at this price I may buy an additional two at the XXL size, only $20. Up till now, I've been using Kinetic Tape [KT] another good product but not always water proof and needs constant attention not to mention IF it always takes on my skin. THIS product satisfies all the above.",5
4310,My cats went CRAZY over this!,5
4311,I loved this show and was so disappointed when it was cancelled after six seasons.,5
4312,This dress is very comfortable. I would recommend wearing a slip under it as it is very thin. I‚Äôm going to have to hem the bottom because it‚Äôs long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and even in wedges it hits the floor. But it‚Äôs great for the price!,5
4313,going to order more soon,5
4314,Great for health & sickness!,5

4316,"Sturdy and works well. The main problem is if you have imperfectly shaped apples, then you still need a knife to cut out the part of the apple core that the cutter sometimes didn't get, but that's how all the apple slicers like this are. I've used it for three months and it still works great. I don't know why I didn't buy one earlier.",5

So I figured at best they should be a little better off. It was better than that! My brushes are like new! A couple I needed to clean two times, but considering how much build up on them there was, was completely warranted. I‚Äôm so excited that I discovered this product as I finally have a reason to buy nicer brushes! Clean up was easy!",5

4330,Very flattering leggings. I am 5ft 4inches and 150 pounds and ordered a Large. They are not too tight and fit me perfectly. I love the fact that they are mainly cotton. The material is thick enough to not be see-through and not thin like t-shirt fabric. You could size down if you like a snugger fit.,5

4338,"Doesn‚Äôt take much but a dot in my V8. It‚Äôs fire hot, not made for the weak.",5
4339,I really like the answers of the practice questions. They give you reasoning as to why the wrong answers are not right.,5
4340,Not as good as the 1st Verison but has really good graphics,5
4341,A great sweater for a holiday party. Make sure it‚Äôs cool enough to wear though - it‚Äôs SUPER WARM!,5

4345,"I loved this rose gold color and everything about it was great! The only thing I had an issue with, was it was really plain. I like having a little more detail in the handles and I did notice that before I purchased it which is why I still give this 5 stars!

4349,Love it came so fast!!! Thank you.,5
4350,I have been using this is in my room with peppermint oil to keep bugs away and it seems to be helping. I had no problem figuring out how to use it. I like how it has different timers and auto shut off. My only concern is the oil seems to go faster than the water and I go through a bunch of oil.,5
4351,This was a fun read...looking forward to the next,5
4352,Quick delivery great product,5
4353,"Does what it says, works great.",5
4354,"My brothers and I, all veterans, wanted to replace my dads flagpole for his birthday. I'm not sure what we expected as far as the circumference of light illuminating the flag but I consider this perfect as both of my parents were able to see the flag and have commented on it several times. Just what we wanted. I would ask folks to understand that this light is really for home use and does not illuminate a large area on the ground. As it is mounted on top of the pole the circumference of light is smaller and stronger at the top while larger and weaker on the ground. Thus don't expect your flag and pole to be lit like a government building. If you want that, buy a different commercial grade light.",5
4355,Perfect size and good quality. Great for cupcakes,5
4356,Loved this book.. Couldn't put it down!! Loved every single character in this book. Starts with a bang and finishes with one.,5
4357,"At first, I was unlucky to receive a defective unit that lasted two months. I sent the company a private complaint (admittedly, a little bit too bitter), and they responded immediately in a way that surprised me: ""We sincerely apologize and we just shipped you a replacement. We want you to be happy with our product."" They didn't ask for a proof of the problem nor to send my defective unit back. I got the replacement in just two days after I complained!

4362,"I have seen a few ants around my apartment almost every day recently, so I bought this little device to see if it works. It is actually pretty effective. I have not seen any ants for days now. It is so easy to use. I just plugged it into my electrical outlet and it works just like that. It even has a small blue LED light, which looks quite bright at night. One downside is that it would take up 2 slot on your outlet as the device is quite long (about 4-inch long and 2-inch wide). It is also effective for small area. If you have a big house, they recommend to have one for each room, which will add up quite a lot of money. Overall, it works well for my small apartment.",5
4363,Granddaughter lived it!,5
4364,Love listening to these CDs. Would recommend!,5
4365,"Just received them (very quick service) and they are just as pictured, maybe even better. Got 4 shells, all in perfect condition and various colors and the plants were big, bushy and very healthy. Easy to assemble and they are adorable. Thanks!!!! Highly recommend.",5

4367,Grandkids loved them,5

4371,Works great. Really enjoy listening to radio from other countries. Can't believe it was so low priced.,5
4372,"The boxing is amazing and the product came well packaged. The earbuds have amazing bass and are loud without having to turn up the volume much. The sound quality is mediocre. They fit well in my ear and does not fall out when I'm running or playing a sport. These are not bad wireless sport earbuds, especially for the low price.",5
4373,What I liked most is that the ink cartridge actually worked!,5

4377,"While this product is motion activated, I use it from dusk to dawn lighting of my drive-way. With it being LED I really haven't noticed much of an increase in my electric bill.

4379,They‚Äôre cute and work well for my kids. Price is definitely great for kids sheets.,5

4381,My son Loves it for his 6 years old birthday! The package including everything you need. Highly recommend,5
4382,Bought the wrong color so looked like an idiot trading in a rose gold and black iPhone lol product was quality though for sure,5
4383,This Mouse has a very sleek design and comfortable in use. no click sound at all. but since my palm is big hence it is not very convenient to use so long. if mouse design is a little bit big then it will be great. most suitable for women hand.,5
4384,"Only gave 4 stars for durability since I have not had the case very long; case fits very well & gives me a more secure feeling when I am holding my phone. Since I am not someone who is always looking at the phone there was no need for a ""fancy""cover. This frost cover is ok but has no dazzle if that's your style.",5
4385,I love all the quality of the products i have biught them,5

4396,This is my Monkees in its entirety. Every album. All the joy in one boxed set.,5
4397,The bags are awesome!! Kids loved them,5

4409,It is very helpful to prevent slipping for my high heels which does not have good protection. I will repeat the order for my all shoes.,5
4410,"All the pockets and functionality are just right. I can't really find anything about the usability that annoys me such as pockets or organization not quite right. The pockets are placed and sized well and I find them all useful. The most annoying thing about it is that it does not stand up straight on its own, however, it has a very predictable side that it falls to. It leans predictably so it is not an actual issue against it's overall usability.",5
4411,Better than I expected. Great value,5
4412,Very nice product. Feels solid not cheap.,5
4413,"I'm never buying pads again! I've been using these for months now and I absolutely love them. They're super durable and easy to clean, great for people with sensitive skin or who have allergies.

The money you spend now saves you ever having to spend on pads again.",5

4415,Great price and very easy install,5
4416,"There was some question on as to whether or not these were solid stainless steel or not on the listing. Since the seller made a point of saying they were solid, I decided to give it a shot. The bad news: my grill was 1/2"" too wide, so I had to saw off the nubs on the end of the grates to fit. The good news: they are definitely solid stainless as advertised, so I am not worried about these grates de-laminating like my old factory grates. Glad I bought these. They look great, well-constructed and feel heavy duty. Can't wait to fire up the grill!",5
4417,These feel nice after a long day. Warm them up in the oven for a bit and instant relaxation.,5

4430,The low volume is quite good just a little louder than expected but that‚Äôs okay,5
4431,They fit and don‚Äôt leak. The gauge reads full with a full tank. Have yet to run them down to see how they read when they get lower. Will update the review if necessary.,5
4432,The product covered was a wireless mic receiver and transmitter. I covered ith with square trade for three years. After 1 1/2 years of use the product stopped working. I contacted square trade and within 24 hours my claim was duly attended to my satisfaction.,5
4433,Interesting perspective on America and Politics today.,5
4434,"Great product, I got this for my dad because he tends to drop a lot of objects and when i got him his airpod case, i was worried it might break. This case did the job and the texture made it non slip so it wont fall off surfaces as easily. The clip also makes it easy for my dad to clip it to his work bag so it wont get lost easily.",5

4443,I highly recommend this product. I ordered these for my grandchildren to share a bit of the UK. Our uncle would send them to us every year and I wanted to share the wonderful memory.

4452,A handy piece of equipment for some creative lighting.,5

4454,"I like this concept, I think you have done an acceptable job, created a device that successfully burned down the letters of wood and other things, but I hope this letter is more straight, not a rounding end. This requires a slight rolling of the letter to make it even. I also hope that these letters will be further highlighted, because if you press too hard, it will also burn unnecessary background.",5
4455,"Love it! As with all Tree to Tub Products, I‚Äôve incredibly happy with this toner.",5
4456,"Received this file box last night, and begin to put my documents in as soon as I received it. It is very good for me as my husband and I get a lot paperwork to save. The colorful tags make it easier to find what I want. The material is strong. I finally get something to help with the messy drawer! Love this product! I believe I will buy another one when this one is full!",5

4470,I really like the way the case works as a stand and that you can stand the ipad at different angles.,5

4472,"This is a well made device, much higher quality than the three previous cat feeders we've tried. The iOS app works well although the design is a little confusing at first. The portion control is good and the feeder mechanism has worked reliably. The camera provides a clear picture and it's great to be able to check remotely that the cat really is getting fed. Setup was relatively easy.",5

4476,"Vibrant color, soft and very comfortable.",5
4477,It's a great watch! This is my 2nd purchase of the G-Shock. Unfortunately I lost my 1st which was still going strong after 2 yrs. Love the watch. Simply having a cell phone just doesn't cut it to tell me time. Plus it's a fashion statement. I would recommend this watch and the entire G-Shock series!!,5
4478,"I love this board can be mounted with just a few thumb tacks. There are no major holes left in the wall. It comes with all the tacks needed and 4 colors of erase markers. It rolls up, which is portable and nice. I run a home based business, the daily calendar has ceased marital debates about the schedule. I wish I had found this 4 years ago. Also if you live in an apartment, the Property Manager will appreciate the very small footprint it leaves. Thank you!!",5
4479,Just as described and expected!,5
4480,Nice router no issues,5
4481,great movie....I enjoyed watching it.,5
4482,"I have this installed under my spa cover to help maintain the heat. My spa is fully electric (including the heater), and this has done a good job reducing my overall electric bill by about 15% - 20% each month since last November. Quality is holding up fine, but it's out of the sun since it's under the spa cover. (Sorry, can't comment on what the longevity would be in the full sun.)",5

4490,"I checked out local stores, and all the Depot and hardware stores sold these at $10 to $15 more than buying on amazon. Yes I could of had one that same minute at the stores. I wasn't driving around wasting gas for this hitch by the way lol, I was shopping for tools and other stuff in separate days, I just always checked to see how much they would be when I needed on. With that said, I have hauled many things other than this light weight quad. I used the same hitch on my F150 to pull a 12ft trailer, and it doesn't have a dent or scratch on the hitch or ball. This is a 2"" ball, light duty stuff but it's heavy duty for 7,000 pounds if your vehicle can tow that much weight!",5
4491,"I absolutely love this iPad case. It‚Äôs extremely stylish and durable. I‚Äôve had it a couple months and it still looks brand new. It‚Äôs magnetic so it wakes up whenever you open the case, which is very helpful. The case also has 3 different ways you can adjust it when standing. Overall, this is a really great case.",5

4493,It works really great. I highly recommend it.,5
4494,Love the 3 books of the series!,5
4495,Purchased the blue color... It's very big but provides a lot of shade. It doesn't touch my neck or get in the way when I work. Had to use a piece of Velcro on my hard hat and the shade because it kept wanting to spin around when I worked but other than that I love it.,5
4496,I am extremely satisfied with the flair pens I ordered. Shipping was very prompt and the product arrived in excellent condition. The colors are very vivid and the tips are durable. Thank you for a great product!,5
4497,True to color and a great size. The adhesive is actually very strong. Properly clean the surface before attempting to install. They take some patience and precision to install but the end result in beautiful and makes the space look more polished. We used them in our rv bathroom and love them. The color is dreamy.,5
4498,"Very impressed by this screen protector! Many are hard to put on or get bubbles underneath them. This one was very easy to place and came with an alcohol wipe, microfiber cloth, squeegee, and a dust removal sticker. The screen applicator has little tabs that you can hold to place the screen. Shipping was not incredibly fast, but the product seems worth the wait.",5
4499,"I love this water bottle. It's very soft to touch, not like the hard plastic from your typical water bottle. It has a little strainer cap under the list. It gives you the ability to add fruit to your water and prevent it from coming through the drinking portion of the bottle. What amazed me the most is it came with a bottle cleaner.",5
4500,"I get in multiple fights at work and definitely needed this, mic will stay right after secure.",5
4501,Very durable. All in one product.,5
4502,Love these blades for my Gillette Fusion. I tried many cheaper razors and none worked as well. I do not use on my face as I‚Äôm a woman who just likes the Fusion better than any razor. The only issue is the top part flips back a lot and it hurts to shave that way but other than that they are great. Sadly this 3rd order will be my last due to price increase.,5
4503,Absolutely love the set! My 2.5 yr old daughter is very happy with her bedding and describes the owl to us.,5
4504,These fit perfectly and were comfortable to wear all day . They did squeeze or give me a headache. And obviously adorable! Had so much fun matching these with outfits on my recent girls trip.,5

4515,Pretty cool . Fits note 10 and other stuff,5
4516,"I'm have thick curly hair that I have to apply a lot of heat to just to get it semi-straight. And because I use only coconut oil it tends to leave my hair with a cooked kind of smell. This spray works! I sprayed my hair all over one time and it immediately cancelled the coconut odor out of my hair. The scent smells so nice and it's lightweight. I could smell it for about an hour or two and then it faded, but It totally canceled all the odor out of my hair...no more cooked smell. And I can use a little bit every day every time I curl my hair and it doesn't dry it out or change the texture whatsoever.",5
4517,Good product. Screen protector hard as glass to scratch,5
4518,Great fit... very warm.. very comfortable,5

4521,"So far my daughter loves it. She uses it for school backpack. As far as durable, we just got it, so we will have to see.",5
4522,I think it's really cool right now but it could use some more updates on the video chat.,5
4523,"This little gadget is amazing! This set includes everything you can possibly need. The accuracy of detection is super, the device is very compact and can easily go into your pocket, super easy to set up and use! Great item for the price!",5

4530,"like the product ,was supposed to be a surprise gag gift. but now the suprise was spoiled since our email is a shared email address.Not good!",5
4531,Had my first experience using a baking mat and loved it. Ordered these and have had good experiences so far making Christmas cookies. I love that I can put this right into the oven on a cookie sheet so I don't have to try moving my dough over to ruin the shape of the cut out cookies. Don't have to waste any more parchment paper! Easy clean up. It came with two so that was a nice bonus. Would make a good gift for a baker!,5

4541,Very cute short curtains just what I was looking for for my new farmhouse style decor,5
4542,"THIS IS A GODSEND. I have always walked my 2 girls on 2 separate leashes... One would zig, the other would zag, and before I knew it we were ALL THREE tied up in retractable leash cord. My hands were always full, holding the re-tractor case things. This allows for ONE leash, and each strap can be adjusted to be longer or shorter so you can even stagger your pups on this device. Made of solid material, doesn't make me fearful that it will break mid-walk. Great buy.",5
4543,Would Not Use any other Cologne,5
4544,"We bought this to do something unusual for a motorcycle lift. We have an electric bed and my wife developed physical constraints that keep her from crawling into bed because the legs of the bed are too high and therefor the bed is too high. So I bought this lift to raise her up about 6 inches and it works great. I have a high torque drill and uses it to rotate the mechanism. It works well! But, one question I plan to write the seller is: Because we are not lifting up some thing that is centered, the lift developed a side to side looseness that I want to fix. I try to get my wife's feet in the center but the leaning load is taking its toll on the lift. If I was lifting a motorcycle I can't say enough good about it.",5
4545,"Sharp as heck, be careful !!",5
4546,"Kat has her hands full trying to solve the murder of a judge---and clear her husband's name. He is a district attorney and is too busy trying to get on top of a case that he inherited only a day or two before--thanks to that judge! So, in-between attempting to write her next book, taking care of the dogs and cooking so her husband will at least eat one meal a day--she calls on everyone possible to get to the bottom of this. She really meets up with some interesting characters. And of course everyone is telling her what they know--the phone is ringing off the hook--and she is using a lot of gas!! This delves into the porn industry in a very sensitive way-it will not offend anyone. It also tells ways to help those addicted. The ending will definitely surprise you and left me feeling sad for one of the characters, but not the murderer!",5
4547,Love working my wife out with these gloves.,5
4548,The peeler works exactly as I hoped it would. I bought it specifically to peel mangoes and it does a great job.,5

4564,My daughter loves her bean bag chair!,5
4565,"Works great on 5/8"" plywood for cornhole only a few holes so far.",5
4566,I like this series. The main characters are unusual and very damaged from a terrible childhood. Will is an excellent investigator but due to a disability he believes he is illiterate. Slaughter does a very good job showing how people with dyslexia learn ways to hide their limitations. It will be interesting to see how these characters play out in the future. I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal. I'm sure this is a good representation of what police come across in their career. The procedural is well done and kept me interested from start to finish. I'm looking forward to reading more of this series soon.,5
4567,Great book for daily living,5

I have applied many varied screen protector products. I found it really cool that I could feel confident ordering this for my mother or anyone else who doesn‚Äôt necessarily have experience with devices OR accessories. I‚Äôm giving 5 stars because everything came as described and I‚Äôm just impressed with the packaging for ease of installation.",5
4572,well built for the price,5
4573,Very comfortable and warm gloves.I bought these for very cold winter motorcycling.I wore them yesterday on a 50 minute ride in 20 degrees F and not one bit of cold sensation got to my hand.,5
4574,Using the thermometer couldn't be easier. There's a single button that swaps between degrees F/C (Fahrenheit and Celsius). Accurate readings appear in just 3-5 seconds and to turn it off just swap the pen back on the side. This thermometer is a fantastic value and will be purchasing more for friends and family.,5

4582,I was worried that they wouldn't fit since most frames are too large for my face. These fit perfectly!,5
4583,Super cute matching aprons! The color and design make it great for both mommy and daughter or mommy and son. I got them for my daughter in law and grandson to wear while baking together. He is only 1 year old but loves to hang out in the kitchen and play with the whisks and bowls. The apron will be big on him now though he is tall for his age. It appears to be the right size for a 2-3 year old.,5

4585,"i absolutely love these! no more ripped clothes while carrying my poles around, no ripped seats and no holes in my fingers! couldn‚Äôt be happier",5
4586,"These are very handy for organizing when packing. I was able to put them to use last night when my son stayed overnight at my parents. Usually his bag is full of toys and makes it difficult to get around them to his clothes, but I put all he needed in just the middle size packing cube and threw that in his bag, making it very easy to, rather than the usual digging around for socks, etc.",5
4587,I loooove the smell of this oil and its charms are potent as well. I wear this often as my regular scent. About to order my 3rd bottle. <3,5

4602,"These are amazing for the price. The macro lens a bit finicky, you have to be able to get very close for your subject for the focus to be right, (I mean so close you're almost touching).

I wear them with Vans and booties and they actually stay put!",5

I didn't want to have large scissors dangling and getting caught on things as I like to wear my scissors on a badge pulley on my waste band for quick use in the ER. These fit the bill for cutting fabric tape, bandages and even clothing items. The bent edge makes it easy to get them in where I need. I'm glad I got them.",5
4636,I'm happy to have replaced our old rack with this one. Works well.,5
4637,"Ok, we have a 40' trailer in a campground that during peak season has power issues with the voltage dropping well below 110v. I wasn't sure how or what this would do to the situation, but after plugging it in and comparing the voltage before and after, i was amazed. turn the microwave and the ac on, and this compensates to keep the voltage constant. If you have a trailer, you need one of these, it is well worth the money and will help protect your investment.",5
4638,I love the length of this hose and the fact that it doesn't kink or curl in upon itself.,5
4639,I was actually blown away by the quality of this costume...the little girl it was purchased for loved it!,5
4640,"I think I would do it different if I ever have to it again. When trial fitting them I would mark the end of the first rail with a pencil, that way you won't put on loose or stretch them. Once stuck you cannot undo it.",5
4641,"Really cool, small and LOUD alarm. Humidity function works well. REALLY BRIGHT - only downfall if there is one is no F only C on the temp (thankfully I know both)",5
4642,"Very good at keeping mud, debris off the motor. Did not add sound dampening as others have suggested and did not realize too much of an increase in sound. Very thick aluminum. I'm confident this can take some pretty good hits.",5
4643,Smooth and easy to operate. It goes down very low and can go high enough for a 6' person to comfortably groom. Appears to be very solid and we'll made - does not shake at all.,5
4644,"I really enjoyed this book. I thought there would be the telling of horrible treatment by whites, and, indeed, there was some. There was also a deep, personal truth that needed telling and that was the surprise for me. I think the author a very brave man for this. I'd like to thank him for sharing. I wish every book could be this way: an intimate baring of the soul, showing our common humanity.",5
4645,"It even has a dot on the front to show u where to apply pressure to make it stick to your bathroom wall. This item is convenient and the suction works really well, better than all the other travel bottles ive tried.",5
4646,Easy to install. Plug and play. Will make a huge difference riding at night.,5
4647,"Love, love, love this! Made cutting my diamonds and triangles a breeze and corners were sharp and precise!",5
4648,The price is cheaper than others. Material is quality. I have used for over 6 months without any issues. Recommended to buy this brand,5
4649,I enjoy all the fragrances and the assortment is great. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that nowhere does it tell me if they are natural or synthetic.,5
4650,"It might not be something you should use by itself, there needs to be a stretch and strengthening routine coupled to it, but I will say, that I have been suffering from low back pain, from a bulging disc, and this brace takes a lot of pressure away from my discs by modifying my posture. I can stand for longer, I can sit for longer, and I don‚Äôt even feel the constant presence of pain in the area while I wear it. Even though this targets my upper back and shoulders, it has provided great relief to my lower back. It didn‚Äôt solve my issue, but it helps a lot.",5
4651,I bought this for my german shepherd. It's been great. It was much gentler than a standard collar when he was learning to walk on a leash.,5
4652,This item was and is just right.,5
4653,Worked fine for what I needed it for. Had an expensive set I bought several years ago but lacked 2 sizes smaller that i needed . Cost less to buy the whole set than the single sockets.,5
4654,ordered 3 of these books and shes read them all,5
4655,"Perfect size for espresso. Well packaged, very durable, highly recommended.",5
4656,"Perfect, came with everything needed. God quality and fit perfectly. Much less then original brand.",5

4660,This worked perfectly for a backless dress. I‚Äôm so glad I picked this one!,5
4661,"I bought this for my son, he loved it! Easy to set up and get going, amazingly good picture quality. You can see clearly see moon details.",5
4662,It was very easy to install on my laptop.,5
4663,"I totally love this cover! It completely changed the look of my rustic cabin-looking futon. The futon itself is very well made and solid wood but the cover was old and ugly. This cover fit perfectly and it's super easy to put on. I did have my husband help on the side because the mattress was heavy, but otherwise the cover zips really fast. High quality zipper. The material is linen so perfect for kids and houses with pets. Not super soft but when people stay over I put sheets over it anyways so it's not a big deal.",5
4664,Our 6 month old Daughter always needs a security blanket wherever we go. We bought these as backups and they have been so durable and they are really cute too.,5
4665,"My last case I RIP off the cover plastic to install temper glass but I messed up, this one I can RIP it off and install temper glass under, not recommended it was a lot of work, the case offer good protection, the part I like most is the imitation carbon fiber boarder around the back",5
4666,They are ok except. The fitted pops off.,5
4667,"The charger cables arrived neatly coiled in the mailer. 3 different lengths useful for different arrangements. The colored cables feel sturdily made, easy marking for which side faces up going into the connector. And all 3 cables were priced very inexpensively. Good stuff.",5
4668,Much prettier in Person,5
4669,"Super cute boots! Love them, great quality!",5
4670,Works as expected. Ring terminals are smaller than the threaded connectors on a deep discharge battery. A little shorter than I expected which makes it hard to put in a battery box (though is the advertised length) I wish it was 4 or 5 inches longer for use in a battery box.,5
4671,It keeps my phone safe. I like how is sitting in my hand very good quality. Amazing!!!,5
4672,I've become the grill king of our family! I love this set. The gloves work great! Just what I was looking for. The meat tongs are nice and the meat thermometer works perfectly as well. Great grill kit and great value. Highly recommended.,5
4673,I'm trying to get wedding ready and this is a huge help. It helps make me accountable everyday and it comes with some great tips too!,5
4674,Our Parrot loves it and she climbs all over it to the top. My 12yr old and I put it together with minimum issue. Little hard on the top cuz I'm 5'4 and it requires a little muscle but my daughter is 5'7 and did the tall stuff.,5
4675,I got it for my 1year old baby girl. Very good soft smooth on ears And won‚Äôt break easily for sure. And awesome color also lovely.,5
4676,"We had these lights before that we had purchased from a home improvement store several years ago (about 3 years ago). They held up well in the Phoenix sun, and when we moved, we wanted some landscape lighting in our new home. Look forward to more years of enjoyment with these.",5
4677,Really like the bottom lashes! Cute packaging and nice quality.,5
4678,I bought these for a Nerf battle birthday party for my son. We put buckets of these bullets out on the battlefield and they worked great! Highly recommend!,5
4679,A must read for all who are looking for transformation in their thinking. A great inspiration in moving from fear to freedom. Add to your library today!,5
4680,"Easy install. My daughter loves it, since the first day she got it, she need to play it every single day.",5
4681,Right size for my yard,5
4682,Just what I was looking fore. Works great with my weed whacker.,5

4684,Great item. No scratches and easy to use and very convenient i would recommend this to other fitness proactive individuals,5
4685,Fantastic buy! Computer arrived quickly and was well packaged. Everything looks and performs like new. I had a problem with a cable. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me out a new one. I can't say enough good things about about this purchase and this computer. I will definitely use them again.,5
4686,"This item is great, and it arrived sooner than it said it would. Just in time for my sons birthday party!",5

4693,Can't wait for the next book to be published.,5
4694,"I have 3 of these in my house so far. They are tiny, unobtrusive and work great with my SmartThings Hub. I use Scotch Command Strips in the small size to attach them where I want them. We have a 50 pound dog that sets them off, so I‚Äôve had to be creative with tape to cover portions of the sensor.",5
4695,"I finally found a glove that fits like a glove! Gloves I've purchased in the past just didn't seem to fit right. They were either to short, to tight or to big. This glove is the perfect fit. It's nice and snug and the wrist part actually comes down to my wrist and the magnetic marker is so handy to have there. I think I'll get a couple more of these while I can.",5
4696,Exactly as pictured. Easy to use and looks great.,5
4697,I love how the waist doesn't have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.,5
4698,Filled with lots of great info on how to clean up your liver with ease naturally. Lovely easy recipes to follow as well!,5
4699,"This makes almost the whole series. Roman Nights will be the last one. Loved them all. Alaskan Nights was awesome. Met my expectations , hot SEAL hero, beautiful & feisty woman. Filled with intrigue, steamy romance & nail biting ending. Have read two other books of yours. Am looking forward to more.",5
4700,In the picture it looks shorter than it is. It‚Äôs not a crop top!,5
4701,"Amazing! It doesn't bleed through, the colours are really cute even though the pink isn't quite as light as I wanted, but still perfectly functional",5
4702,Very good price for a nice quality bracelet. My sister loved her birthday present! She wears it everyday.,5
4703,Very nice harness!! I think I got the wrong size but that‚Äôs my fault. It worked very good with my large dogs since they like to pull me every where it was a lot more comfortable for them.,5
4704,This is a very good deal. The smart tags were easy to set up and the quality is great. I bought 4. I am very pleased with this purchase. Oh! They arrived quicker than estimated.,5
4705,Takes awhile but it works.,5
4706,These arrived in great time and look darling as part of the gift I‚Äôm making for friends and neighbors.,5
4707,Amazing flavor with just the right amount of sweet!,5
4708,We used this monitor and 2 cameras for 10 months without issue until it was dropped and stopped working. DB Power was able to replace it for free under warranty. Very happy with this product.,5
4709,"Now that I know, the line in the base to line up the number of the roof pitch was near impossible for me to see with my not to good site. Now I found it after I finished 95% of the install process. All was great, except for that detail. It works just great, I'm sure it will help with the heat buildup. Please make a better mark in the base. I will probably never install another for the rest of my life. This was my first. I'm 65.",5
4710,"Great water bottle, wish it was slightly larger just so I didn't have to refill as frequently. Works like a charm, you set up the alarms so it notifies you to drink. Once it goes off, you can simply open the lid and drink and the alarm will cease. Well made product, good quality and bpa free.",5
4711,Bought as a gift and was well received.,5
4712,Loved this!!! True to size and gorg!,5
4713,My 12 yr old gets compliments everywhere he goes...especially when dad and brother are wearing coinciding condiment tshirts! The print is a great quality & the yellow is very bright!,5
4714,Ive used this 5 times now. I love it. Its so much more comfortable then the one i got from walmart.,5
4715,Great lights! Super bright! Way better than stock! Fit my 2002 ford ranger no problem! Love the led look! Had for about a year and only one bulb went out around 6 months i emailed them my order number and address they sent me a new bulb within 2 days! Works great ever since!! Great product for the money! Great customer service!,5
4716,"I didn't really have high hopes for this dress as I was expecting more of a costume-like dress, but I pleasantly was surprised! It is really cute and the fabric is thicker than I was expecting which is nice. It is a little tight around the neck and the zipper does not seem to be the strongest, but I got several complements and would highly recommend this dress!",5
4717,"Excellent read!! I absolutely loved the book!! I‚Äôve adopted 4 Siamese cats from Siri over the years and everyone of them were absolute loves. Once you start to read this book, it‚Äôs hard to put down. Funny, witty and very entertaining!! Siri has gone above and beyond in her efforts to rescue cats (mainly Siamese)!!",5
4718,I repeatedly order this product and this seller is the best.,5

4721,"I'm enjoying my Instant Pot cookbook. Have already tried two or three recipes, and they are great.",5
4722,"I've always bought 2-stroke engine tools for use in the yard. I've had Echo, Toro, and Ryobi, (Home Depot junk, their carburetors are terrible) It doesn't take long for the 2-cycle engine to get harder and harder to start with more pulls. Right out of the box, with the 1st tank of gas (not the oil-gas mix like for 2 cycle engines,) the 4 cycle Makita started on the 1st pull and has been a delight to start every time I have used it since. What a delight it is to have a 4 cycle engine. Buy one if you need a new yard machine.",5
4723,I like that the package came with mutiple bulbs. I use my himalayan salt lamp daily and these work well with them.,5
4724,Love the jeans hope to get more. Thank you.,5
4725,This is a very good not expensive reader. My husband was able to determine what‚Äôs wrong with my car and save me a lot of money on repairs.,5
4726,"I store equipment in an old barn / shed and do not want rodents chewing wires / destroying other stuff. The old D-con pellets always worked well but when they went to bait blocks the mice just laughed and ignored them. While you must now buy a gigantic bucket, it is good to see that the pellets are still available. Yes, use common sense and do not put them out where kids or pets might find them but, unlike the blocks, these do work",5
4727,These work great! Im a bartender so mine get a lot of use.So far the only issue ive had is the paint chipping off.,5
4728,Comfy and yet fashionable. Perfect for just about any occasion.,5
4729,Very nice. My Grand daughters love there chef bonnets and aprons.,5
4730,They spill when they tip over but other than that they‚Äôre great. They‚Äôre the same size as advertised and don‚Äôt leak when you shake them if you hold down the top.,5
4731,I bought this for my son who recently started classes at college. It has been perfect for all the things he needs to access while at school.we have no issues with the adapter and it has been great having additional ports.

4733,"This is easy to use, great quality and fun too! My husband uses it on his 4 wheeler. He is really enjoying it.",5

4735,"Very stylish, love the length!!",5
4736,"My cousin has one for his kid, my daughter loves it. I got one for my back yard,but not easy to find a good spot to hang it. After i cut some trees, now its prefect. Having lots of fun with my daughter. Nice swing, easy to install.",5
4737,"This is by far the best book about Fairy`s I have ever read. Great characters, very disruptive, colorful. I can actually visually see and feel like I am in Twilight, it is so well written. I got all the books when I got this one and hope they are all just as well written. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the fairy world.",5
4738,I cannot chop my onions without this little thing these days.,5
4739,Cheaper at the company Amazon is twice the price,5

4743,It was perfect. Beautiful.,5
4744,"Small, but very bright garage light. We have tried all kinds of different lights in our garage so we can work into the night on various projects. Took a chance with this one thinking there is no way it could be so bright, but it‚Äôs amazing. Quick and easy installation. You can also angle the lights so they don‚Äôt have to be directly down at all times. Very happy with this investment!",5

4746,Easy to install. Looks good. Works well.,5

4749,They are large and very cute,5
4750,"The book is very good, the transport process has some dramatic accidents, but the store is very patient to help me",5
4751,"I was really happy to find a new toy that both my cats really love. They chase this toy and each other through the home taking turns batting and carrying the toy in their mouths. I've already purchased a second set since the first ones all disappeared quickly (i.e. that secret place where all loved cat toys finally end up). Anyway, they are pretty inexpensive so I don't mind buying more because it is so much fun watching them play.",5
4752,"Great sunglasses!!! Bought another pair of sunglasses and they were broken wi a week. These are durable, look good, great quality.",5
4753,"The Marino Avenue brand Men‚Äôs low cut socks are of good quality. I put them through one cycle of hot water washing and drying and they stood up to the challenge. What I like best is the color choices on the socks. The green, yellow, red, and black one is my favorite combo.",5

4755,"quality canvas fabric. constantly falls off my shoulder, so I wear it crossbody",5
4756,"This is a great product considering that I'm always losing my Microsoft pen, at $60-$80 a pop. Also, bright colors so easy to spot in a dark restaurant. Also, fatter barrel is a better fit for my fat fingers. No magnet, so forced to keep in a safe place, eg, my shirt pocket. And the battery cap is so much easier to handle than the Microsoft. I just wish it had a pocket clip. And caveat, I don't use the fancy multiple pressure levels, etc, fine artwork.",5
4757,A really nice razor . Gives a close shave. The battery lasts a long time but you cannot shave while it is charging.,5

4761,"This is a very helpful book. Easy to understand and follow. Much rather follow these steps than take prescription meds. There used to be an app that worked as a daily checklist from the books suggestions, but now I cannot find the app anymore. Hope it comes back or gets updated.",5
4762,"Loved this movie!! The purpose discovered for stepping outside of our own comfortable, yet complicated lives, to see the perspective of someone else..and in this movie, it is a homeless man. People are just people lesson that works well for these characters as they pass from the fear of stereotypes to finding the hearts of one another and how perfect the title becomes! Great movie!",5
4763,"It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets! I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friend‚Äôs house. While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea. Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!",5

4777,Google maps took us up a road that became to narrow to turn around with a drop off on one side and a rock face on the other. Could not turn around or back down due to snow and ice. These chains saved our butts. Super easy to install and remove. Worked like charm getting us safely back down. Absolutely recommend.,5
4778,Came as expected and upgraded hangers from smaller ones- Would definitely order again.,5
4779,"Exquisite packaging, have USB C Adapter, my android, apple's old and new interface can be solved by one wire. It's great.",5

4795,Bought as gifts and me. we all love how this really cleans our electronics and my glasses,5
4796,Awesome tool for Toyota/Lexus cartridge filter. Way less messy than using the plastic items that come with the filters to drain the oil from the cartridge. The flow doesn‚Äôt start until you turn the knurled handle after having threading it into the bottom of the cartridge. Clear tubing is handy to direct the oil into a pan or directly into a recycling container.,5

4798,"These are not the official Sonicare replacement brushes, but they fit great on my toothbrush. They are not very different than the original, besides having slightly rougher bristles. This is a great value product.",5

I paired it with an iClever wireless folding keyboard and my Lenovo blue tooth mouse/pointer and it is working great! good size for surfing and for book reading and that is what I was after. The keyboard and mouse pair right up and work well. Some apps don't support spell check w the keyboard purchased 128gb memory - that should be just fine. I can even get a SIM card for it. It also does split screen for multi tasking. Lenovo makes quality stuff,5
4802,"This is THE BEST mascara I have found. I live in south Florida and this stays on through humidity, rain, everything and NO clumping or smudging. It's buildable and really easy to remove. LOVE IT!",5
4803,"Super cute, exactly as described, very well made",5
4804,I bought this Handle pull as I had some already but needed some more and found them on Amazon. I am very pleased with the handle Pull as they are exactly like the ones I already had.

And yes I would recommend to my friends to buy them.,5

The 2 tiered rack has enough room for snow boots to fit on either tier, it's made of a heavy duty plastic & was a snap to assemble. Now boots are not all over the bottom of my closet & I have enough room for my 2 vacuums with room to spare.",5

4814,"Have had probs with Hockey Balls. My dog loves them - her favorite fetch and chew toy - and they float. That is until she chews them to bits. Tried several, even the ""hot weather"" versions - and they lasted a few minutes longer than the others. Until these showed up. These have stood the test. My dog is not big but she is stubborn about what she chews. Like they say, its not how big the dog in the fight but how big the fight in the dog. Thumbs up from Daisy and I.",5

4818,"I saw the John Wayne version of this film in a theatre in 1970. In my opinion this was his best performance of his career. Later, I read the book. I love both versions of the film, but if I had to choose, I would choose the Coen brothers. They really followed the book. As Matty states, ""You must pay for everything in this life. Nothing is free except the grace of God."" She pays a heavy price for justice. The Coen brothers portrayed the ""spirit"" of the story completely. And every actor was totally believable in his/her part. An incredible work of art.",5
4819,It's nice to be able to read a good mystery without the profanity and elicit sex most novels peddle to sell their books!,5
4820,The colors are great and very versatile. I love the half moon style. I am extremely happy with this purchase!,5

4830,"I bought this book to read during a road trip. I loved it, couldn't put it down! Suspenseful, keeps you on the edge of your seat! Perfect summer read.",5
4831,GREAT for my gun cleaning efforts. Scent isn't at all offensive. I think you would be pleased in any penetrating oil type usage--it works well on my folding ladder that was beginning to give me real trouble with folding.,5
4832,I am 44 years old and I am a size 10-12 with a bra size of 36D. The XL was a perfect fit. It has plenty of support on the top and covers the bottom perfectly. I wanted a swimsuit that was cute and still covered me. But I didn‚Äôt want to look like an old lady! This swimsuit is perfect and the quality is great. This was my first swimsuit purchase online and is a winner!!,5

4837,Great product. Very satisfied with my purchase.,5
4838,I ordered this to decorate for autumn at my office at work. It's excellent. It's light-weight vinyl so it cuts easily if you need to make it shorter and it's easy to hang with just a few pieces of tape. The colors are vibrant and we got a lot of positive feedback from co-workers. I plan to buy more for other seasons!,5
4839,If what you need is something for few tools you‚Äôre just gonna throw in the truck or your trunk it‚Äôs perfect.,5
4840,I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author's next book.,5
4841,Nice inexpensive headphones that are fairly comfortable and the volume can be adjusted on the wire. Easy to plug in to computer and play. Quick delivery!,5
4842,This product really works. You just have to file the top clear coat. But really it‚Äôs the best way to remove gel without ruining your nails. I‚Äôve ordered two bottles and they both came within two weeks.,5
4843,Great value. I thought 3mil would be flimsy but it is not. Good for storing things.,5
4844,I live in the country and can see far away.,5
4845,Soft and perfect for our 1 year old.,5
4846,"This is a WELL TOLD Romance that spans an ocean from England to America. Lots of description of the places you will visit as you read. Well developed characters, I especially like the characters of the Duke of Bancroft, Amelia, Anna, Jake and Jonathan. Nice surprises at the ending, and a clean read. Highly recommend this as all of her books have unique story lines.",5
4847,"All the subjects of this book are very delicate, touchy. They are definitely subjects that need to be addressed and this author, Deborah Rainey, does it in a Godly way. Made me stop and think about my attitudes. God does work all things out for His glory if we will just trust Him.",5
4848,"Michener the philosopher of the 20th Century clothed as a novelist. In an engaging style, tantalizingly follows the life of a Jew, an Arab, and an American Catholic at an archeological dig in Israel to tell the painful history of modern Judaism. Somehow he finds hope for both Israel, Jew, Arab, and in an amazing way Palestine.",5

4855,"My hair is almost 30 inches long and it is so soft and healthy that I just cannot do my hair like other women can so this is a great way of being able to hold my professional job while looking professional. Because let's face it, we still live in a world that corporate/professional positions still view prim and proper as a means for being professional in appearance even though how I look has nothing to do with my work performance! This is perfect <3",5
4856,Very handy for when the common cold has gotten the worst of you. Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Sometimes she puts essential oils in the water which adds to a pleasant scent.,5
4857,High quality product. I prefer the citrate formula over other types of magnesium,5
4858,This product is really slick - one stop shopping for all my connectivity needs. I love just throwing this and my laptops tiny power adapter in my go bag and being prepared to work on a big 4k display or grab photos from my camera. The only odd thing I experienced (and I‚Äôve experienced this on all 4 usb-c hubs I‚Äôve tried from different brands) is that mac‚Äôs apparently can‚Äôt tell the difference between multiples of the same monitor (so my mac outputs the same video to all identical monitors connected to the hub whether by HDMI and/or VGA). But if I use 2 separate hubs/adapters or 2 different models of monitor then the mac properly outputs to the displays individually.,5
4859,"Perfect chairs for my home office! I wanted the swivel and no wheels. Reasonably comfortable, seat cushion is a bit like memory foam... great modern look. Easy to put the base on... four screws, and came with the tool.",5

4863,The light was easily assembled.... I had it up in about 15 minutes. Powered it up and I was in business. It has been running about a week or so and no problems to date.,5
4864,Love them. have to turn off when not in use tho,5
4865,bought for my young adult son and he loves it. So glad it wasn't fitted at the waist. the print he digs especially with the contrasting cuff color.,5
4866,"S.M. Pratt, I really enjoyed this book. It is different and sexy as all. Cannot wait to start the next chapter. The characters are immensely sexy and this take on writing this genre is refreshing. Wish I could meet a pilot like that! YUMM.",5
4867,Works as it says it will!,5
4868,Recently upgraded my kids from Fire & kids Editions to Fire 8 HD's. While I really like the durability of the kids cases Amazon offers I don't want to buy two of them at 30 dollars a piece. These are considerably cheaper and offer pretty good protection. The are of course slimmer than the Amazon cases but offer really good protection.,5
4869,Great bang for the buck!,5
4870,"Works well, was great for my Injustice 2 Harley Quinn cosplay",5

4874,Holy Crap what a Cliffy! Loved this book from beginning to end and is my absolute favorite so far! Can‚Äôt wait for book 4!,5

4878,I cant believe how easy to install these steps were. We absolutely love them. I wish I had known about them sooner.,5
4879,Works to protect phone. Clear plastic allows me to still use most of the functions especially taking photos. It does not seem to affect the quality of the photos too much.,5
4880,Was exactly what I needed!!!,5
4881,I love scarves!! This is a goodie. The colors are rich. I plan to wear it with a black coat when I accessorize with blue.,5

4885,When I have a sugar craving I eat these to stay compliant with my clean eating plan!,5
4886,"This book is just a delight to read! It‚Äôs a lighthearted tale of a zany and improbable quest by three headstrong and spirited heroines that will have you chuckling and laughing out loud. Even the bad guy is improbably evil and kills the chuckles when we meet him. Don‚Äôt worry! This is a Romance and all is well in the end, which is why I love Romances!",5

4892,Great product! No complaints!,5
4893,Easy to install and keep my threadripper nice and cool!,5
4894,"Seriously the fluffiest towels! The color is beautiful, exactly as pictured, and they are bigger than I expected. Plus, I spent the same amount of money for these that I would have on the ""premium"" (non-organic) towels from Wal-Mart. You can't go wrong.",5
4895,"Good speakers. I like the apple airbud style, but at a fraction of the cost. Great treble and bass sound, and comes with a cord that doesn't annoyingly tangle.",5
4896,"Chair is really good for price! I have 6 children so I was looking for something not to expensive but good, this chair is really good comparing with others and good prices",5

4899,"I purchased this to temporarily replace the Bluetooth function, which recently failed, on my 2015 Nissan Altima and it has been absolutely AWESOME. This is a great temporary fix until I decide on how I want to proceed with repairing the Bluetooth function through the actual radio. I HIGHLY recommend this product.",5
4900,What a really great set of acrylics. My daughter has been painting with them since they came in. The colors come in a wide range of vibrant colors that have a smooth consistency. These paints are packed in aluminum tubes which allows the paint to not dry or crack over time.,5
4901,"My husband loved it! He works HVAC and on his cars and bikes on his off time, so was constantly looking for something he didn‚Äôt have to worry about getting caught on something or about the ring getting scratched.",5
4902,These make it really easy to use your small keyboard on your phone. Would recommend to everyone.,5
4903,My daughter got this today for Christmas and loved it! She thought it was a lunch box at first and honestly I think it would make a great lunch box.,5

4908,This product worked just as designed and was very easy to install.The setup is so simple for each load on the trailer.I would def recommend this item for anyone needing a break controller.,5
4909,Lucas. This book was interesting. I was surprised at how determined Lucas was to make Jasmine his. The issues Jasmine carried around kept her from having a relationship with any man. But Lucas wasn't taking no for an answer. I am glad she found out who her father was even though it was a shocker ! This book was a great read! *** I voluntarily read a Review Copy of this book. All opinions stated are solely my own and no one else‚Äôs. ***,5
4910,I'm am using theses for my bow flex. Nice upgrade!!!!,5
4911,"Works as stated. I have an older flat panel TV with only 1 HDMI input. With this device, I can send outputs from three sources to my TV: a cable box; a DVD player; and a ChromeCast device. Simply press the switch button to select the source of choice. Also, this box is very small; fits in the palm of your hand, so is easily hidden behind other equipment. I rarely give a five star review, but its justified in this case",5
4912,Did not work for a mic on a headset for Xbox but the sound is all there!,5
4913,"This stylish stainless steel blender bottle works great. My green powder blends so well. This bottle is easy to clean, easy to carry around, and fits properly in my car cup holder with a secure lid. Bottomline, this is a great quality blender bottle that doesn't sweat with ice tea. Such a great purchase.",5
4914,Mouse ON/OFF button location could be located somewhere more feasible.,5
4915,"HAPPY DANCE, HAPPY DANCE, HAPPY DANCE!!! This story is a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Here you have tragic events that ripped my heart out, then you have a swoon worthy romance that was sexy, sweet, and just made me believe in love, on to the nosey spiteful small town drama, heartbreak, and ending it all with a warm sweet feeling that I just didn't want to be over. Wyatt and Hannah are two of the most relatable characters that I have experienced this year. Out of all the books that I have read, these two rank pretty high in my memorable couples list. I just want more and more, I was so sad when I got to the end because I just wanted to keep their story going. This specific video review will be included in the October 2018 wrap-up. For other video book reviews check out my YouTube Channel: Steph's Rom Book Talk.",5

4933,We have enjoyed this tray. It lets my sons color and play with their small cars/construction vehicles while in the car. It also allows them to color and keep busy. It has a cup holder that is easier for my 2 1/2 year old to reach than the one that comes with his car seat. Easy to install and also take off when not in use.,5

4935,"Works great, and the quality is superb.",5
4936,Great on carpet. Just okay on hard floors. Bad at little bits of paper. I love it for my girls to vacuum the carpet. The handle height is adjustable for them to use and they find it so fun. Praise God!,5
4937,This product is AWESOMENESS,5
4938,I love these Capris so much that I bought 4 pairs. The high waist helps with tummy control where I have a lot around the waist but skinnier legs and these are perfect. Sometimes with high waist products they tend to roll but these do not and they make your ass look amazing. Highly recommended.,5
4939,This is just what I needed to add to my porch railing to block out my neighbors window looking right into my house. I added silk roses and silk ivy! Its so pretty and no view of the neighbor! Excellent buy.,5
4940,Used these on my wedding cake! Turned out beautiful!,5
4941,I bought two sets. In White. One came with a couple light brown stains. Maybe dirt. Who knows. The lining plastic package was torn. Washed them immediately after arrival with TIDE & dirt removed! So I didn‚Äôt have to return it! The fabric does NOT puff up. Looks brand new even after wash! VERY SOFT! Wrinkle free as noted!!! Very white after washing with plain blue Tide detergent. Will buy again!!! AND AGAIN!! THANK YOU!!!,5
4942,I love the material of these gloves and that I can also use my phone with them on. Have already worn them a few times and love them!,5
4943,I got these as a gift. I've always used Cuisinart Black Teflon for many years but I have to say that this set is absolutely fabulous! I've cooked with them a few times already and cleanup is so easy. Nothing sticks to them and since they can't be used in the dishwasher handwashing is and breeze. I really hope they hold up. Time will tell but ands of now I'm a satisfied customer.,5
4944,Makes life so much easier having a garbage right at your fingertips while you're cooking by the sink,5
4945,This is a neat toy. It is fun to play with. The track pieces snap together easily. It keeps kids entertained. It comes with dinosaurs. It is made very well.,5

4952,"I live in the city, where there's lots of independent stations, and I get 88 of them Lol! Most I can't use, but in Southern California I get 2, 4, 5, 7 but no 11 or 13. Defiantly a good deal.",5
4953,"Quick shipping, Quality product, Perfect fit",5
4954,"This sweatshirt changed my life. I wore this sweatshirt almost every single day from January 25th, 2017 up until last week or so when the hood fell off after almost a year of abuse. This sweatshirt has made me realize that the small things in life are the things that matter. Thank you Hanes, keep doing what you do. Love, Justin",5
4955,unbelievable that it is so easy to use and so helpful for organization. will buy it again and will recommend to friends.,5
4956,We have watched all of the Madagascar movies and I felt this was the best one. It was very entertaining and we‚Äôve seen it many times and still enjoy it.,5
4957,Exactly as described. Is not a generic mount. Made for specific camera only.,5
4958,I have sensitive skin and prone to breakouts. I notice I start to look not so fresh when I forget to apply this toner daily.,5
4959,These are a good value - sound is clear and headphones are light and comfortable. These are my second pair of same product,5
4960,"This is the second one of these that I have purchased. It is an excellent platform for a foam or conventional mattress. It is totally sturdy, and looks nice. I highly recommend it. There are many frames out there that will cost you much more, but this does the trick.",5
4961,"I got it setup and running today. So far I prefer this color of light over the pink grow lights I have. The pink grow lights(not this one) I have work really well but heat up a little. This one is much easier on the eyes and it still has red light colors. The aluminum is strong. It came a little bent but I was able to fix tht. It‚Äôs a very simple construction. I Iike how you can convert it from rectangular to square. It hasn‚Äôt been running long, but so far it hasn‚Äôt heated up a lot. If it doesn‚Äôt heat up a lot and can grow my plants well my review will stay a 5 star and I‚Äôll get more for the rack I have.",5
4962,Easy to clean. Great length for my toddler!,5
4963,"I love the case. I got the burgundy and it looks and feels great! The only downside is that I have a dock to charge my AirPods, phone, and watch and the case doesn‚Äôt fit into the hole, so I have to take it on and off to charge my AirPods on the doc. Other than that it‚Äôs a great product.",5
4964,Bot for my mother and she enjoyed it,5
4965,I've been reading alot on an iPad and have been getting terrible neck and back aches. This thing is easy to assemble and quite compact when you want to put it away. I recommend to anyone reading on a device for long periods. It will literally save your neck :),5
4966,Great price for FCC. I have used this oil with essential oils for rollers and it serves its purpose well. Light coconut scent. Would purchase again.,5
4967,"I really enjoyed Sebastian. He's a true optimist that seeks out the good in everyone and everything, but he's also insightful. He sees Zane's standoffish behavior and knows that he's struggling with something painful. Sebastian offers a listening ear, friendship, and comfort. Zane is stewing in grief and there are moments when it overwhelms him. Sebastian shows up every time, just being a quiet presence. It was wonderful to watch these two so quickly fall, they take a bit to acknowledge their feelings. Lovely ending.",5
4968,This is an amazing book! It's well thought-out and the concepts are clearly presented. It's a visual treat as well as being extremely informative. This is one of my favorite books! Please mark if you find my review helpful. Thank you so much!,5

4971,This unit was so easy to put together and once I put it on the pole on the roof I got 46 channels of HDTV time to cut the cable.,5
4972,"Love the look of these! They look like real tiles! They really aren't too bad to install. Hardest part was peeling the backing off, but found it worked better to peel the tile off of the backing... if that makes sense!",5
4973,Works great! Not loud.,5
4974,Typical Carhartt quality....first rate! What an awesome company! Never owned a Carhartt product that disappointed...and there have been hundreds. My last Carhartt wallet lasted 15 years! What else was I going to buy?,5
4975,This is an excellent budget ultrawide for developers. The screen splitting is really useful for CLI and debugging tools.,5
4976,The item ordered came exactly as advertised. I highly recommend this vendor and would order from them again.,5
4977,Nice product. Doesn‚Äôt smell or leave residue. Just shake spray and everything is dead.,5
4978,I love this product for cleaning my phone Notepad and computer screens,5
4979,never really knew if an acrylic platter could change the sound. but apparently it does,5
4980,I needed this book a long time ago But the Lord has brought me to where I am now without these words and by his love.,5
4981,"I use this bag to carry several Dewalt tools. Unlike costlier bags with multiple pockets, this bag has only one, which is exactly what I needed. Large, sturdy, heavy duty zipper... it's a great bag.",5
4982,"This book is really easy to implement on a daily basis. I am a very busy mom with three kids, having a book like this helps me take care of myself!

4985,"Assembly started with exceptionally good quality materials, fasteners and a simple but perfectly sufficient graphic instruction sheet (1, one-sided!). It went together in a little over an hour, but despite considerable experience assembling furniture, I was being very careful because it is a beautiful piece of furniture. Although it is heavy, if you leave the doors and shelves off until you situate it where you want, one person can lift it and move it. The double layer packaging does exactly what it was designed for - protecting the contents. I will buy from this dealer and this manufacturer again.",5

4995,"It's still early, but so far the scales seems like a good product. It is very modern-looking. My wife got back from the Dr.'s office and said their scale read 3+ pounds lighter than ours....so time to shop. Ours was old....so maybe lost some degree of accuracy. This INEVIFIT seems to be accurate. Time will tell. We like it. Hard to give products a ""5"" when they are still in the ""testing"" phase.....and there is ALWAYS room for improvement. I don't really like to have to use 4 AAA batteries, but I'll get over it. We'll see how long they last.",5
