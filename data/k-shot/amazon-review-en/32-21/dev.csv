148564,"I think these are a great value if you are looking for something cute. You get a variety of cute patterns for a fantastic price, and I definitely think they are worth buying. They are made out of a soft knit cotton t-shirt like material which is just what I wanted. Just know if you want to use these to workout or just casually wear them for a long time that you may have to readjust them as they like to slip back and then off in those instances, at least on my hair which is really sleek. I also have a medium-large head so that probably plays a part. It's definitely not a deal-breaker and I am sure once I wear them more they will stretch out a bit.",4

155054,"There are pros and cons to this product. Pros: it works well; I can see my kids while they sleep; the monitor let's me know when it needs to charge; I like that there is a music button, with the VOX setting, the screen turns off when kids are quiet which preserves battery life; it gives us the option to mount to the wall with 2 holes on the back; it does not connect to WiFi which prevents hackers, so keeps my kids safe; it has volume controls and I can talk to my kids through the monitor which is great when I see them doing something they should not; the monitor for my kids room can twist different ways which is great when mounting. Cons: the screen is small; picture quality is not so great; because of the piece that stands the parent up and the charging cable, it can be awkward to stand up; the volume is not very loud; even though it's given the option to mount, no screws come with it to mount; the speaker control is not great and sometimes my kids can't hear me through it; it only sometimes beeps when the kids monitor gets unplugged. I've given it a 4 because for the most part it does it's job and it's good for what I need it for and that is to be a second monitor to the one of a different brand that I already have. It's not as good as my other one, but it works.",4

But it's not the best on flat/hard surfaces. It's also not the best at getting dust if you don't attach the hose. The exhaust on the sides it really intense and might blow the dust away before you have a chance to vacuum it up. Also, if you don't empty the canister after every use or keep it upright, the dirt/hair/dust can just fall right out again. Finally, it's very loud.
