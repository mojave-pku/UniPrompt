127855,Makes greAt coffee but coffeemaker does not allow your hand to get into that coffee pot to clean it; therefore coffee residue stays in bottom of pot. I like the attachment that removes chlorine from the Warne. Auto brew timer is a great feature.,4
152307,It's everything it says it is.... Works perfect for us!!!!,4
120267,"Well in the picture it says it has 2 vibrators when it really has only one. Other than that it's light and very versatile, I use it for my herniated disc and my epicondylitis and it's great that it's wireless cos I can take it with me to trips and restaurants and stuff. I just think the publicity has to be more accurate. It wouldn't hurt if it really had 2 vibrating points, and better yet, that not only the middle part vibrated but all 3 sections we're functional. Just an idea for Homedics.",4
130126,I like this book. Glad Rebecca and Alex realized that they love one another. Sad that Heather had such hate for Rebecca that she would hurt people,4
156282,This pot is on point. Very good. No sticking.very easy to clean and cooks perfectly fine,4
133660,"These fit well and are very comfortable but are rather frail. Best hand washed or, as last resort, washed on delicate/cold water in the washing machine. Do not dry in the clothes drier if that can be avoided.",4
157316,"Not really a blue light at night, more like a yellow white light. Still, it's better than nothing.",4
141204,"I was skeptical but my better half ordered two of these. We made use of the suggestions from other people who bought these and gave them a good review. Very sturdy. We put them together with the addition of gorilla glue on the pegs. We assembled them and let them sit overnight to let the adhesives dry and do their job. The cranky comments from people who didn't follow the instructions, moving the item right after assembly, not assembling them properly, etc. are tiresome. This is not heirloom furniture but it does the job if you put it together properly.",4
153551,Love the look of this costume. My daughter loves it - good for twirling! :) Only complain is cheapness of accessories - the gems on the wand fell off after 5 minutes of trying it on. Hopefully we can glue them back on.,4
153131,It is beautiful but it slide off the table a lot.,4
141379,Basement humidity is much better using this,4
147747,My daughter got this book for Christmas. It is great to be given so many ideas of things to draw. I just wish there was some sort of instruction or a picture to copy. It is literally an empty book.,4
144727,"Nice looking, appears to be well-made. Not as lightweight as I would have hoped, but perhaps it can't serve its purpose at a light weight. The tightening screws, handles, etc., are sturdy, and legs are stable. Will work well.",4
136619,"But the metal join on one side has a small snag. It isn't enough to stop me from using them, but it is noticeable as I knit. Otherwise they're great, and I like the finish on the needles--not so slick my work slides off but smooth.",4
140855,"Thought that I would stand upright for the most part, but it kind of folds over when it is full. It is durable and lightweight for taking to the laundromat",4
128778,"as advertised, loved it",4
128391,This game is a lot of fun.,4
148765,I also bought the solar ones--love it. My advice is to get the solar and not worry about batteries,4
150547,As noted in at least one other review product arrived with no top. When I have purchased this product in a pet store it has always had a top on it. This is my favorite aroma of the other colognes in this product line; last only a day or so which is disappointing.,4
124668,Love it and results!! Only thing is it was pretty messy,4
137341,Bras are very comfortable. Perfect for breastfeeding.,4
137402,"Fast-paced romance with a little magic thrown in for good measure. Not an intensely deep story, but still a fun read.",4

120130,I love these glasses. Very good quality and they look great on me. I'm happy.,4
131492,"The window of time to return this product was one month. Although the product broke one week after that return window closed, the merchant was very responsive and was able to rectify the situation by replacing the product. I’m very impressed with their professionalism and responsiveness to the matter. They are definitely customer oriented.",4
159639,"They're a little looser than I was expecting but I think I'm just in between sizes (xs and small). Overall, length is great.",4
138131,"Loving it so far, although I do feel the suction isn’t perfect but enough to do the job.",4

20862,Absolutely does not work for my new iPhone 7Plus. After about 5 seconds the screen showed “not a supported accessory “ or something to that effect.,1
35994,"seriously. it was so hard to open my arms hurt and hour later. I can lift a 20 lb bag of cat food (not that I do it often, but it's possible for me to do without issue). in comparison, this was a nightmare. I'm using it as a grow light, not for a workshop, so I have no experience with work lights. So the word clamp has specific connotations... They DO NOT INCLUDE, that they must be twisted TOGETHER TO close. It's not like a hair clip, like a regular clamp. I figured id attach it to the shelf above to keep it upright by CLAMPING it on.. You know, like a CLAMP. YOU CAN'T. it needs to hang from a pole. a freaking pole. it's basically the equivalent of a stronger twist tie that will supply power to a bulb. it's cheap - in price, looks and construction. So the only people who will be able to find this useable are those very strong, with freaking POLES!",1
27746,Says it was delivered and I never received it. Unsure of how to contact seller,1
37654,Had to constantly change battery. Worked sometimes,1
15250,"This is the worst scale I've ever owned. I can step on the scale without clothes and then again fully clothed and weigh the exact same thing. It's almost like this scale remembers your last weight and if it's close, just displays the same thing over and over. Other scales I've had in the past are so accurate that you can literally see an ounce difference when you add or remove weight. DO NOT buy this thing if you are weighing in daily or keeping close track of your weight. All it is good for is a generalized number and is definitely not accurate!",1
18387,"Needlessly had way too many alien species. Physics as described made no sense. Like the human eye could see ships across a solar system, or see laser beams in vacuum Portals visible at distances described.",1
28565,"I love tapatio, so this is not a bad review of the product but rather the vendor. They shipped the glass bottles with no type of protection and when they arrived to my location all the bottles were broken.",1
29449,Way too small band ! Doesn't extend.. partner feels his area is going to loose oxygen cause it's so tight.. other than That it's good,1
32921,Horrible! They are very tiny and are not the same as the ones in the pictures. They could probably fit into the mouth of a newborn baby but that's about it.,1
33703,"I loved it, but it broke right away!",1
17740,Two of the bulbs burnt out within a day of use. One is still working. I would NOT buy these again!!,1
32096,"The main point I want to make is that the camera works as expected, unfortunately as soon as summer came along the body could not stand the heat and warped so that it no longer will stay in the mount. I live in southern CA and it isn't really that hot. I think that anyone using this camera in Phoenix would likely have a puddle on their dash after leaving the car closed up all day in the AZ heat. In my humble opinion I would not recommend this as a first choice.",1
33990,Don't Wast your Money,1
2880,"Made with low quality plastic which breaks easily, not good for daily use.",1
34605,The package my tiara was sent in didn't protect it and when I opend the package the tiara was broken. Very unhappy that it was delivered broken and bent.,1
18357,"Balls and mounds of lint everywhere. Covered my sheets, my clothing and after three wash and dry cycles it was worse than ever. Very soft but just made too big a mess.",1
36068,Mine was broken where the warranty seal is. I tried to put it in the printer anyways very gently and it was so fragile that it broke apart. Good packaging so I doubt that it was damaged during shipping.,1
4829,"To small for my motto e4 plus, will send it back.",1
39208,The pole of the umbrella bent in wind that wasn’t blowing hard enough to rustle trees. Don’t waste your money.,1
18947,"I replaced the ink with these and the printer does not recognize them. I have tried several times to take them out, put them back in. I shut off the printer and tried it again. Nothing seems to work. Brand new and useless for me as they are not recognized.",1
36291,Have it for a week doesn't work bug still flying around my house,1
19947,Did not seat properly upon rib of 870 shotgun. The baseplates under the rib bend when you screw them in tightly. Upon tightening one of the baseplates stripped out. Pretty cheap design.,1
543,The chord either was defective or not compatible with our PC and monitor. There is little help provided from the manufacturer,1
4108,Junky. Poorly made.,1

36402,This picture frame arrived all scratched up and used/old looking. We are unhappy.,1
26723,when we recieved this product it was hard as a brick and still trying to break it up. Very disappointed.,1
83787,The color is nice and I wear it all the time when it's raining. But it's a little too thin for me. It was also a little tight in the chest area.,3
107394,"Outlets are really close together -think about what you want to plug in before buying. I purchased this to plug in 3 cords (not USB). Due to the sizes of the plugs, only 2 would fit and the middle outlet was pretty useless.",3
119023,"I cannot decide if I like them or dislike them... As someone who is fairly comfortable with putting false lashes on with lash glue, I find these extremely difficult to put on. The length of the magnet is fairly short. Once I was able to adhere the magnets, I was shocked at how comfortable they were on. However, because the length of the magnet is so short, the lashes look like they were hanging on for dear life. It's like when you wear false lashes and one of the corners doesn't stay on so you have that lash peeking out. I may have to cut them, but I think they will end up looking like corner lashes instead of full lashes. I think with better practice, this may work out for me BUT it might take more magnetic lashes since you have to be extremely gentle with them or else they start to fray/peel off the band and lose its original form. Also, to clarify, you get 8 pieces but they're only 2 pairs of magnetic lashes (2 pieces for each eye), not 8 pairs of magnetic lashes.",3
115646,"Wish the closet was longer, the parts don't fit as well as I would like and the doors don't connect together for the closet part making them all mini cubes without the cube part all opens separate.",3
115171,"Great product ....while it lasts, which isn’t long. It starts to lose power/strength of vibrations very quickly after first purchasing it and continues to diminish until the product stops working completely. Many speeds that are great and it’s rather strong when it’s operating at its full power capacity. If you’re looking for a quality made product, there are probably better choices but for a (fairly) cheap toy, it works well.",3
104384,The story line was good but not enough love/sex scenes for a romance novel. Maybe I just expect more.,3
95389,I was sent a different shade than I ordered.,3
105667,You might as well just dump this stuff out and replace it with some apple cider vinegar. It doesn't work as well and dries up fast. It will still kill a few here and there but not as fast as the apple cider vinegar on its own. Save your money and get the large bottle at the store and you'll be fine.,3
108393,over all book was in good shape just upset that the dust jacket came damaged but all pages were clear and there,3
107849,Not sure if these run small or if my head is just too big? I ended up giving it away to my little cousin. I really liked the hat. It’s so soft inside BUT it would not stay on my head.,3
101944,I mounted these lights under my cabinets last night. This morning I found them laying on my countertops and on the floor.,3
118027,Beware these are not the size that are in the picture.. They say they are light blocking but they really aren't that dark. I have some I bought from target and they do not let any light in! These aren't worth the money!,3
91302,Very nice bag. Compact and smart looking,3
117890,"Havent noticed much change in my hair with pulling verses a normal pillow case, but these pillow cases do NOT breath. At night you will get very hot if you run hot already. I should have known...",3

81044,Good glasses. Lens kept popping out so I had to glue it in.,3
114311,"I'm not sure why this was a best-seller. The first couple of chapters seemed lame but I got through them. The remainder of the book never drew me in--it's as though I was just listening to someone tell me their story. Even if you account for ""cultural differences,"" some of this story didn't make sense. It really could have been so much more and I don't understand why this made a best-seller list.",3
112078,"I had an original cube in the 80’s, and I thought it would be fun to play with one again. I didn’t want a fancy speed cube, I was just looking for one like the old toy. This one is smaller than the original, and it doesn’t feel at all the same. I’ll have to keep looking. The little stand is functional but really cheap and flimsy. The logo is only silver on one side, the other two are just molded plastic. I’ll probably just put it in the shelf without the stand.",3
89969,Hard to wash. The fur on top gets all over the sides in the wash. :/,3
81532,"These turtles were good, but no better than the ones that you can get in the store for a lot less. They do NOT have real Tortuga Rum in them. It is artificial rum flavor... and it TASTES artificial too.",3
109392,I like them but they aren’t made as well as in the past. Elastic isn’t as sturdy. Must have new manufacturer.,3
98485,Red color could have been more bright. It was just okay.,3
106294,I ordered 2 sets of these and they're exactly what I needed. My only complaint is that the adjustment screw is so tight that I completely stripped one in trying to get it loose. Now I need to order another set.,3
96606,"Said it would fit my door, bur screws were too long, The outside handle did not fit into existing holes. The lock handle did not not fit into existing hole, in this case too much paint. This also caused the lock operation to be very hard.",3
113144,"Frustrating that you can't pull up the barcode from your phone. Who prints things anymore?!!?! The cashier was a little confused, but eventually figured it out. And, if you don't use the full balance, they don't put the rest on the card - you have to keep the paper you printed to use it again. Otherwise, it worked fine.",3
110686,"I really like the socks, just wish they came up a little higher and did not roll off my knee.",3
105691,Very cute but does not stay in/secure hair by itself. Came in a timely manner and for the price I have no complaints.,3
85307,"I like the device design and colors, but wish the changing color setting changed at a slower, more gradual pace. The device makes a ver faint, but high-pitched hissing noise and gives off an internal blue light when the upper light is turned off. This means I have to hide it under the bed. I wanted it to be a bedside charger, but the noise and light are not conducive to sleep.",3
107112,The order was fine I simply got the wrong size and did a return for the product and have ordered another one. The only thing that upset me is that I am being charged to return the item.,3
95572,worked for a week then quit working. was pretty good for the first week though.,3
101463,Smaller than expected,3
82725,I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because the actual ball entertained the puppy for a bit. The battery life on this thing isnt good. The weasel part came off day one and my Moms dog weighs 3 lbs. Def not a good buy for any dog.,3
193078,love these greeting cards! they're small but adorable. will definitely be buying again.,5
166523,I buy it for my granddaughter to do crafts with. She like the tapes and sticks it on everything. She uses the tapes to decorate her iPhone 6s which with a clear case gives it a one of a kind look. With this pack it gives you 40 different tapes and she loves them all. She put them all in a ziploc bag and has been toting them around like a long lost treasure. This is the second set I have ordered and there will be more orders in the future! Thanks for the great product!,5

196665,"Great quality! Just what we needed! Fit was good, easy to take on and off. We have it by our pool area and great knowing TV is protected when not in use.",5
163751,The best moisturizer for my face and neck. Also use it on hands and arms as a moisturizer and ski. Softener. I have been using this product for years and it is the reason I have minimal wrinkles for being 84 years old.,5
192343,I was so pleasantly surprised with my husband's pick of this cap for me. Even the description makes it sound fun as it is. Good for a young or older person as I can attest to. The grey color universal and the tweed gives it character. Exceptionally soft but holds it shape and perfect over any hairstyle.,5
191382,These work well on dry eyes. Just use them before going to bed.,5
179846,These little eggs work wonders for potty training a stubborn toddler!,5
198580,I love my new Alta. I had a Charge 2 but really like the design of the Alta and the fact that you can change the bands. Ordering online was convenient too!,5

178148,Wow! Great Concert with the return of Bobby Kimball doing his thing with as always great musicians and a sell out crowd. Great Audio and Video,5
195778,Pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. Received numerous compliments,5
191946,Having a whole town experience time travel makes for a completely different kind of time travel story. I love learning about the history of the 30 Years War in such an interesting way!,5
172095,It fits well and has been enjoyed by myself in several cosplay situations so far.,5

So when I received my pair (mind you it comes is a very cute package), I reviewed the video again as I didn't want to mess it up. The instructional video is SO helpful and so easy to follow. I am on my feet all day and these laces are fabulous. They stay in place and are comfortable. I never have to worry about laces coming undone. These are a must have!

62893,"These did not work out for me at all. I wear a Women's size 10 medium and these were too small and cramped my toes. The fabric made my feet feel very hot too. I did like how they don't slip around your foot though. Because they were too small for a Women's 10, I returned them.",2
79853,For the price I figured they wouldn’t be as good as the more expensive ones but they are made of extremely thin sheet metal. Have a 1-2” gap around them and do not even include rubber for the edges just a foam round foam sticky pad for the bottom corner. If you aren’t looking for quality or a tight fitting door then these are for you! If you want something that actually seals up the lowers then purchase a different product,2

47801,"Probably dont get this if you need a protector because you drop your phone frequently. I dropped my phone and the entire protector just popped off (because it attaches around the circumference of the screen, unmentioned in the product description) and the entire right side of my screen is all cracked now. Probably fine if you just want to protect your screen from scratches? I guess.... Wishing their ""Lifetime Replacement Warranty"" worked to replace my phone. Also, this thing definitely is not smudge resistant, which isn't important to me, but worth mentioning.",2

74486,The cover is pretty. But I've had it in my purse for a few weeks and it's not in a high traffic pocket and the binding is already coming undone. If I used it every day I could see that be justified but I don't.,2

57524,you get what you pay for,2
45348,The product is very miss leading of the size they are nowhere near what it looks like in the picture. Definitely read the description the pieces were no long that 16 inches and less than a 1/2 inch thick. Better for a small 10 gallon,2

58349,"When I received the product, it looked as if it had already been used. There was water in the steamer slot and hair on the iron. I used it once when I first got it and haven’t used it since.",2
67782,No matter what I do I cannot get these to stay in my ears. I've almost run the lawn mower over them coz they keep falling out. So now they just sit in a drawer. Big waste of money.,2
75651,They are soggy after toasting. I tried to fix that by adding more time to the toasting but they just came out dry and difficult to eat. They also fall apart while trying to eat them. You'll need a spoon... I can get better waffles.,2
54732,"Pillow Cover slick and not a typical pillow material. Would NOT recommend. The REAL Better Homes and Garden pillow from Walmart that has insert included and not just a cover has a cost of $2.00 more and is worth the money, NOT this pillow COVER. DO NOT RECOMMEND this seller's pillow cover at all.",2
45813,Silicon portion does not quite fit and I'm very disappointed that you cant put the phone in the holster with the screen facing out. The picture shows the holster being used as a kickstand but you can't actually do that because the phone wont lock in screen facing out. Also I bought two of these in different colors and they are not even close to the same case.,2
54549,"The reason I am giving this a low rating is because these briefs are labeled as Gentle Wash, Do Not Tumble Dry. I have ALWAYS washed my underwear in regular wash and tumbled dried them. I suspect the elastic is of poor quality and will not tolerate regular wash and dry cycles.",2
78954,These claim to be hypoallergenic but I don’t believe they are. I have very sensitive ears so I’m very cautious about purchasing random earrings. I read the reviews and decided to give these a go. The INSTANT I put theb in my ears my ear holes ached! I took them out immediately.

Guess the name Peugeot doesn't mean what we thought it did. It is very difficult to select the grind, and it doesn't come out when you do get it there.You cannot fill it very full. Junk for $42.",2
61163,Fable 2 Heavy and too hard to get on I did not care for them at all the material was so thick too heavy for me!,2
65545,I loved the pattern but they were way shorter then the cheaper compression socks I ordered. I was really disappointed and will not be ordering from them again.,2
67028,Photo is VERY deceiving. looks like real marble in the photo and it is just a piece of plastic when you get it not worth the price wish I actually looked like rose gold and marble but it definitely doesn't.,2
