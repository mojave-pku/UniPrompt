87578,"You get what you pay for I guess. It was quite large. I measured my son and ordered a size smaller than what he would usually wear, the jacket was so big around the waste and the material was not very nice. I did return it and ordered a different one.",3

96394,"Bought for my husband, he's a size large. Unfortunately, the fit around the arm is pretty tight. The rest fits true to size. He still wears it hoping it will stretch. Its a nice shirt, feels soft, I'd recommend buying a size up just in case.",3
93624,I absolutely love this high chair. The print is adorable and it is so lightweight it's perfect for a small house. My only complaint was the cover was not removable so when my son's diaper leaked on the non wipeable part of the fabric I had to cut and sew the cover to ensure that it was removable. Safety belts still come through and my son is still secure and I don't have to worry about gross stains where he eats. I'm not sure who thought non removable was a good idea for a high chair.,3

This one has a lip separator for each pill box which is a lot more difficult for my mom. The other box allowed you to slide the pill box in place. It is okay for the normal person, but not if vision impaired. Also the lid doesn't close down flat unless you click it closed.",3
102434,"It's exactly what I excepted it to be. However, I just want to state a suggestion/improvement to the product. It would be nice if you have a quantity of 4 sets of legs. That way you could use an extra set to raise your stand a little higher. So I will have 2 spare plastic platforms and 2 outfitted with all the legs. I needed to raise my monitor just a tad more than what was provided. So, I ordered another one just so I can raise my other stand.",3
92390,"Ok read... fun little book, and easy to read. Not sure I can give it more than 3 stars simply because those attracted to its message will have come to it for a purpose of sorts. It is pleasant and even teases to spark the imagination, but I would need something... else. It points, ha, to something but leaves us in the end wanting more.",3
100737,"The first one I bought didn’t fit right so I purchased another, still no luck. The material is fine and they are the cutest thing ever. The problem is the leg area was too big. My dogs back legs would come out and it was actually a bit dangerous because they would get stuck in the clothing.",3
103352,I like the product so far. Packaged came with product oozed out all over container box. Fault of Amazon I think as it was mailed in an envelope (get a clue) Smell is light and husband says it smells like tea. I will update,3

97262,"It stuck well (be careful about alignment) and holds well, but it sure does makes some mild noise on top left corner when pressed. Overall pretty good.

102381,Did not fit window sill,3
99971,I like the layout of the days in the board and it fits my refrigerator fine. Those are the good points. The bad points are that only 2 of the round magnets actually function. The markers write but won't stay in the board with their magnets (plus they don't mark very well). Overall I'm happy with the board but the accesories are fairly useless. My advice is that if you need accessories don't count on these and be prepared to get some from another source.,3

10646,"I just received my tree bags in the mail this weekend. I was excited to finally put my tree away and use these brand new bags. I bought the 2 large storage tree bags to break down my 9' tree and separate it into two bags so there would be no capacity issue. The handles may be heavy duty reinforced, but the remaining stitching of the bag is worthless. My tree comes in 4 parts. I put the middle two sections in one bag, zippered the bag and the seam split. The bottom section (largest and heaviest part of the tree) and the very top of the tree (smallest part) fit nicely in one bag, however when I went to zipper it up, one of the zippers fell off. I was glad there was a zipper on the other end of the bag to close it properly. I was not very happy with the product and I specifically bought two so I would not have this seam rip issue. To have the zipper just fall of the end of the other bag without even trying to close it was very disappointing.",1
22560,"We originally ordered these in Nov 2017. The bags were awesome and we never had one break or tear. So when we started running low in March of this year, I made sure to order the exact same product. We did not need to open the second box until a couple weeks ago. I knew something was wrong when I pulled out the very first bag. The plastic was different and it didn't have any ""give"" to it. Needless to say, every single one of them has ripped so far and over very stupid reasons. The corner of an Oreo bag made a 6 in tear and all I did was pick the trash bag up to move it 5 feet away. We are 10 for 10 on damaged trash bags. The worst part... We have a lot of cats. Several times now the torn bags have spilled dirty cat litter all over the floor.",1

It looks nice on my counter and serves its purpose. Updated review: Ok so the salt cellar that did not break during shipping pretty much shattered at the lightest touch after 3 weeks on my counter.

Unfortunately, there's no way that I can find to complain about this to anyone at Amazon. I tried re-downloading, but as I 'm in the midst of another bundle (and this is the first time this has happened since I bought the kindle) I haven't checked to see what's what yet.

I’m not sure if I got a defective product or if it is made poorly, but it’s really frustrating that it broke just a few days after the 30 day return window. It’s not like this is a super expensive item but I definitely would expect it to last more than 1 month for the price. I’m giving it a 2 because it worked well before it broke.",2

I cannot reach around and put them on once the bra is on and it is almost impossible to put them on first and turn the bra around. I live alone and needed someone to help me with them. Not for me but maybe okay for others.,2
60372,I ordered the correct part but when I tried to line the holes up they didn't match. The holes in the rail were about 1/32 of an inch off. The screws were also the wrong ones. Wrong thread.

Yes, I left the hose spigot on, but we didn't even break 90 degrees a single day during the month that I had this hose. It burst and was useless in literally 32 days. Amazon, thankfully, accepted my exchange on this hose, even though it was outside of the return window. But now, I am about 15 days into my second hose, and I just can't take the kinks! Literally kinks just by pulling it out. I am returning this hose and buying a hose that is more than twice the price of this one - and 30' shorter! Hoping that 'more money' doesn't equal 'more problems' in this scenario. I, for one, am completely done buying these multi-ply hoses. I am going to invest more in heavy duty, all rubber hoses, and hope that they last longer than a month! Any hose brand that claims ""never kink"" - either in the product title or product description, is a liar - and most likely, their hose kinks worse than any hose you've ever owned! Who would have thought that I would start critiquing garden hoses! I guess they are right - your interests change greatly as you age.",2

The thought that you can put the pads under the rear rollers and slide back into position (as per the instructions) is a farce. Between the weight of the fridge, and the rubber of the pads, they simply do not slide on the floor. At all. They sit put and the rollers simply roll right over the small top lip of the pad. I even tried to oil the floor, hoping they would glide on a slick surface. No, Ended up having to place the fridge in place, and with the aid of a helper, tilt it forward and push the rear pads into place with a stick while looking under the fridge with a flashlight. Then (much easier), tilting the fridge backwards and placing the front pads in place. Bottom line is this... they do seem to work well, but installing them was a pain in the neck.

158685,"This wallet is amazing. The only reason I don’t leave a 5-star review is that the keychain was not made for a small amount of keys, it’s either you have 4 keys or you have over 8, the bolts weren’t built for for example 5 or 6 keys. Otherwise, this product is a must have for all men! Definitely recommended, sturdy, solid, overall great! Go buy it.",4
