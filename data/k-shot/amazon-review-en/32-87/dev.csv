Eventually he learns that Ven might not be mentally stable and that she would do anything to keep Brandon in her life for financial stability. So, he tries to stay away from her to save his marriage.

10897,"This was purchased as a gift. The first time the cutter was finally used was after any return period, and the extender measuring arm was glued at its base, so it could not be opened without breaking the connecting plastic.

386,"Ummm, no.....the ends of the rings are sharp, once you open the ring a little to put it in it's a major pain in the *** to squeeze it back closed, and the color on the colored ones is like a film of some sort that peels off (while I am wearing it!) if I wear it for more than about 24 hours (this was very embarrassing!). The one, and only one, plus for them is no skin reaction of any kind. Hence the 1 star. So again, NO....sorry, don't waste your time or money unless of course you like doing that sort of thing (NOT!).",1

I cleaned it off and realized that the suction cup was not made of the usual rubbery material but just soft plastic and could never have provided complete seal for suction. So some body must have screwed up in the design or manufacturing process and decided to work around it with glue! Well, look at the picture and you can see the result. It is a piece of trash now.",1

47647,"They aren’t sealed, none of them are. So how do I know if they are actually new? I read reviews before purchasing and they said each one was sealed - not accurate.

52658,Cat had no interest. Not fault of the product.,2
75822,I am dissatisfied with the durag since it doesn't fit properly on my son's head. It doesn't compress the waves on his hair. So the purchase was a total waste of money.,2
49565,All items werent not in the pack. I only received 6 slap bracelets and several items were not as described. Now I have to run out and buy more from party supply store to finish party favor bags. not worth it.,2
43956,I liked this case when I first got it but about a year later it has began to fall apart. Pieces have chipped off leaving sharp edges and exposed areas. I will be ordering something different to replace it.,2

45618,"The positive is that it looks great (we stained the outer bit of the wood to be a bit darker) and works for our purposes. However, I am just not happy with the QC for this product. One of the long panels was cut with two female ends rather than a male and female as the other 3 sides were, so it wouldn't go together securely. The thing was very heavy and I was not about to attempt to find a box to put it in to return (as the box it came in had to be completely destroyed to get this out as they had taped and stapled all the pieces to the inside of the box) so we just put that corner in the back and used some extra long deck screws to try to pull them together as best we could. I emailed Suncast and have yet to hear a response after over 2 months so that was not a mark in their favor either. We went with a different company for the second deck box we needed for by our pool instead of getting the same one (this one) we got for the deck because of this.",2

42943,"These are soft pillows, but not super soft or fluffy. And, not really supportive soft, like I've found hotel pillows. The description and reviews indicated that the pillow is ""hotel quality, soft and supportive"". It comes with instructions that explain to give them time to fluff after being opened (they are vacuum sealed), and, fluff by hand. I did both, and still they aren't that fluffy. I also contacted the company before I wrote this review, as they send those emails because they care about their customers, and I never heard back.

130313,"But it’s a genuine subaru part, which can be (expensive). Much better than anything you’ll buy at a auto parts store, so there’s that. It’s sturdy, the glossy emblem looks great and comes with all the hardware. Plus I like the fact it actually has the plate slide in and is held by the frame itself. Not to pick nits. Just wish the frame itself was a bit darker and shinier. Would really make it pop for the money. That’s all.",4

The only thing that’s worrying me is the color is somewhat fading and i have been washing the bowl by hand without using any abrasive cleansers. Definitely better than plastic bowls (toxic) though.

I can't give a rating on durability because I have not had the case very long (about a month) It seems to be durable. I have had similar cases that have lasted a long time. The phone does not fall out of the case and I like the raised edge around the face of the phone to prevent screen cracking. I like the color of my phone and the clear case was a great choice as it fully displays the phone. Overall I am happy with this purchase.",4

158622,"Decent quality tools, and good selection of useful items. The hammer is a good weight and not flimsy like in other kits. The bag is very nice and has extra room. Put together dresser, desk, nightstand and other apt items no problem. Cons: needs a multi blade small hand saw had to buy one separately. Also doesn’t come with basic screws/nails for hanging pictures or any electrical or duct tape. Adjustable wrench would also be a plus. All in all a decent set for the price. Just know what you need when comparing - no one needs a 100 piece set where they count items you will never use.",4
157049,"This is a lovely set of 10 fancy fashion doll dresses for 11.5 inch dolls. The dresses are handmade with Velcro closures, and in random colors and styles. I like that they fit both newer and older style barbie dolls, and that the Velcro closures make them easy to put on and remove. They are of decent quality and the assortment I received is very nice, without any repeats, although four dresses do have the same bottom lace. I had to trim a couple of threads that were sticking out but nothing major, and the Velcro closures feel quite strong. I received the following dresses in my set: 1 red dress with lots of lace and a bow with hearts on the top, 1 dress with a white top and layered ruffles in purple, pink, and blue, 3 blue dresses, 1 with multi-colored metallic droplets covering the dress, 1 with a bow around the waist and pink dotted lace, 1 with a neck ruffle and pink and white floral lace, 1 white dress with silver butterfly wings on the top, 2 purple dresses with different styles of lace trim on the top, and pink and white floral lace on the bottom, and lastly 2 pink dresses, 1 with lace and darker pink on the top, and pink and white floral lace on the bottom, and 1 with sequined ruffles. I like this set of dresses a lot, and I would definitely recommend it to others.",4

This is good seller and you have nothing to lose by trying this product. If it works, then that's awesome. If not, you can get a refund. That being said, this product did not help our dog.

135780,"Fit a 2007 Honda Civic LX, got the A/C running. The two snap rings included didn't fit, the included shims were a different size than the existing parts. I used the old snap rings, shim, and nut. The splash guards inside the wheel well and the front of the engine needed to be removed, to get at the compressor from below. A number of the plastic clips broke and needed replacing. The A/C Compressor didn't need to be removed, but needed to be unbolted from the engine to create space to remove the pulley and coil. Needed a fairly narrow set of 8"" external snap ring pliers to remove the coil. 6"" didn't get deep enough, adjustable square nose pliers didn't have enough space to open. The new pulley was a tight fit, engine assembly lube helped push it onto the spindle.",4

125386,I can’t mark anything for durability yet bc I’ve only had it a few days. But the case exceeded my expectations when I was searching for a soft jelly like feel type of case. I went with the softer more pastel yellow. Which is incredibly cute but I should have went with more of a mustard for my personal style. The open front case made for easy installation. Previous cases similar in the past are all jelly like silicone through and through. This one caught my attention as soon as I opened the package due to the back part which my phone sits on is lined with a thin layer of suede or a suede like material. This has been the best case I’ve gotten for my iPhone. If you have a tempered screen then the jelly case is the perfect amount of protection. I will look into more colors and variety and will definitely look at this seller first.,4
