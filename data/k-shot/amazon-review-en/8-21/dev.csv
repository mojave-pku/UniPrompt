153551,Love the look of this costume. My daughter loves it - good for twirling! :) Only complain is cheapness of accessories - the gems on the wand fell off after 5 minutes of trying it on. Hopefully we can glue them back on.,4
153131,It is beautiful but it slide off the table a lot.,4
141379,Basement humidity is much better using this,4
147747,My daughter got this book for Christmas. It is great to be given so many ideas of things to draw. I just wish there was some sort of instruction or a picture to copy. It is literally an empty book.,4
144727,"Nice looking, appears to be well-made. Not as lightweight as I would have hoped, but perhaps it can't serve its purpose at a light weight. The tightening screws, handles, etc., are sturdy, and legs are stable. Will work well.",4
136619,"But the metal join on one side has a small snag. It isn't enough to stop me from using them, but it is noticeable as I knit. Otherwise they're great, and I like the finish on the needles--not so slick my work slides off but smooth.",4
140855,"Thought that I would stand upright for the most part, but it kind of folds over when it is full. It is durable and lightweight for taking to the laundromat",4
128778,"as advertised, loved it",4
28565,"I love tapatio, so this is not a bad review of the product but rather the vendor. They shipped the glass bottles with no type of protection and when they arrived to my location all the bottles were broken.",1
29449,Way too small band ! Doesn't extend.. partner feels his area is going to loose oxygen cause it's so tight.. other than That it's good,1
32921,Horrible! They are very tiny and are not the same as the ones in the pictures. They could probably fit into the mouth of a newborn baby but that's about it.,1
33703,"I loved it, but it broke right away!",1
17740,Two of the bulbs burnt out within a day of use. One is still working. I would NOT buy these again!!,1
32096,"The main point I want to make is that the camera works as expected, unfortunately as soon as summer came along the body could not stand the heat and warped so that it no longer will stay in the mount. I live in southern CA and it isn't really that hot. I think that anyone using this camera in Phoenix would likely have a puddle on their dash after leaving the car closed up all day in the AZ heat. In my humble opinion I would not recommend this as a first choice.",1
33990,Don't Wast your Money,1
2880,"Made with low quality plastic which breaks easily, not good for daily use.",1
108393,over all book was in good shape just upset that the dust jacket came damaged but all pages were clear and there,3
107849,Not sure if these run small or if my head is just too big? I ended up giving it away to my little cousin. I really liked the hat. It’s so soft inside BUT it would not stay on my head.,3
101944,I mounted these lights under my cabinets last night. This morning I found them laying on my countertops and on the floor.,3
118027,Beware these are not the size that are in the picture.. They say they are light blocking but they really aren't that dark. I have some I bought from target and they do not let any light in! These aren't worth the money!,3
91302,Very nice bag. Compact and smart looking,3
117890,"Havent noticed much change in my hair with pulling verses a normal pillow case, but these pillow cases do NOT breath. At night you will get very hot if you run hot already. I should have known...",3
111706,I love the purple color. Seems sturdy. But I bought it for the sleep/wake function and that does not work.,3
81044,Good glasses. Lens kept popping out so I had to glue it in.,3
163751,The best moisturizer for my face and neck. Also use it on hands and arms as a moisturizer and ski. Softener. I have been using this product for years and it is the reason I have minimal wrinkles for being 84 years old.,5
192343,I was so pleasantly surprised with my husband's pick of this cap for me. Even the description makes it sound fun as it is. Good for a young or older person as I can attest to. The grey color universal and the tweed gives it character. Exceptionally soft but holds it shape and perfect over any hairstyle.,5
191382,These work well on dry eyes. Just use them before going to bed.,5
179846,These little eggs work wonders for potty training a stubborn toddler!,5
198580,I love my new Alta. I had a Charge 2 but really like the design of the Alta and the fact that you can change the bands. Ordering online was convenient too!,5
170545,Product as described. Excellent seller,5
198505,I will keep this one. It took a good hit at 65 ‘ and no damage to phone,5
178148,Wow! Great Concert with the return of Bobby Kimball doing his thing with as always great musicians and a sell out crowd. Great Audio and Video,5
66019,Disappointed that the case broke after having it on my phone for only a month.,2
63580,3 pods didn't grow this is not my first time using aero garden pods!!!!!,2
77178,"The color of Turmeric in my second order is different. It is lighter Turmeric color, and does not smell the same. I think it is a lower quality Turmeric",2
42840,It is cute but not durable. I got it in April and the little strap broke all ready. The band isn't even broken in yet.,2
74486,The cover is pretty. But I've had it in my purse for a few weeks and it's not in a high traffic pocket and the binding is already coming undone. If I used it every day I could see that be justified but I don't.,2
64412,i found this book pretty boring! did not finish the book !,2
57524,you get what you pay for,2
45348,The product is very miss leading of the size they are nowhere near what it looks like in the picture. Definitely read the description the pieces were no long that 16 inches and less than a 1/2 inch thick. Better for a small 10 gallon,2
