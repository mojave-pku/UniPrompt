127855,Makes greAt coffee but coffeemaker does not allow your hand to get into that coffee pot to clean it; therefore coffee residue stays in bottom of pot. I like the attachment that removes chlorine from the Warne. Auto brew timer is a great feature.,4
152307,It's everything it says it is.... Works perfect for us!!!!,4
120267,"Well in the picture it says it has 2 vibrators when it really has only one. Other than that it's light and very versatile, I use it for my herniated disc and my epicondylitis and it's great that it's wireless cos I can take it with me to trips and restaurants and stuff. I just think the publicity has to be more accurate. It wouldn't hurt if it really had 2 vibrating points, and better yet, that not only the middle part vibrated but all 3 sections we're functional. Just an idea for Homedics.",4
130126,I like this book. Glad Rebecca and Alex realized that they love one another. Sad that Heather had such hate for Rebecca that she would hurt people,4
156282,This pot is on point. Very good. No sticking.very easy to clean and cooks perfectly fine,4
133660,"These fit well and are very comfortable but are rather frail. Best hand washed or, as last resort, washed on delicate/cold water in the washing machine. Do not dry in the clothes drier if that can be avoided.",4

141204,"I was skeptical but my better half ordered two of these. We made use of the suggestions from other people who bought these and gave them a good review. Very sturdy. We put them together with the addition of gorilla glue on the pegs. We assembled them and let them sit overnight to let the adhesives dry and do their job. The cranky comments from people who didn't follow the instructions, moving the item right after assembly, not assembling them properly, etc. are tiresome. This is not heirloom furniture but it does the job if you put it together properly.",4

14064,I normally wear a 2xl got the Xl I could have gotten the large very thin material Fix's like a maternity top,1
20862,Absolutely does not work for my new iPhone 7Plus. After about 5 seconds the screen showed “not a supported accessory “ or something to that effect.,1
35994,"seriously. it was so hard to open my arms hurt and hour later. I can lift a 20 lb bag of cat food (not that I do it often, but it's possible for me to do without issue). in comparison, this was a nightmare. I'm using it as a grow light, not for a workshop, so I have no experience with work lights. So the word clamp has specific connotations... They DO NOT INCLUDE, that they must be twisted TOGETHER TO close. It's not like a hair clip, like a regular clamp. I figured id attach it to the shelf above to keep it upright by CLAMPING it on.. You know, like a CLAMP. YOU CAN'T. it needs to hang from a pole. a freaking pole. it's basically the equivalent of a stronger twist tie that will supply power to a bulb. it's cheap - in price, looks and construction. So the only people who will be able to find this useable are those very strong, with freaking POLES!",1
27746,Says it was delivered and I never received it. Unsure of how to contact seller,1
37654,Had to constantly change battery. Worked sometimes,1
15250,"This is the worst scale I've ever owned. I can step on the scale without clothes and then again fully clothed and weigh the exact same thing. It's almost like this scale remembers your last weight and if it's close, just displays the same thing over and over. Other scales I've had in the past are so accurate that you can literally see an ounce difference when you add or remove weight. DO NOT buy this thing if you are weighing in daily or keeping close track of your weight. All it is good for is a generalized number and is definitely not accurate!",1
18387,"Needlessly had way too many alien species. Physics as described made no sense. Like the human eye could see ships across a solar system, or see laser beams in vacuum Portals visible at distances described.",1
83787,The color is nice and I wear it all the time when it's raining. But it's a little too thin for me. It was also a little tight in the chest area.,3
107394,"Outlets are really close together -think about what you want to plug in before buying. I purchased this to plug in 3 cords (not USB). Due to the sizes of the plugs, only 2 would fit and the middle outlet was pretty useless.",3
119023,"I cannot decide if I like them or dislike them... As someone who is fairly comfortable with putting false lashes on with lash glue, I find these extremely difficult to put on. The length of the magnet is fairly short. Once I was able to adhere the magnets, I was shocked at how comfortable they were on. However, because the length of the magnet is so short, the lashes look like they were hanging on for dear life. It's like when you wear false lashes and one of the corners doesn't stay on so you have that lash peeking out. I may have to cut them, but I think they will end up looking like corner lashes instead of full lashes. I think with better practice, this may work out for me BUT it might take more magnetic lashes since you have to be extremely gentle with them or else they start to fray/peel off the band and lose its original form. Also, to clarify, you get 8 pieces but they're only 2 pairs of magnetic lashes (2 pieces for each eye), not 8 pairs of magnetic lashes.",3
115646,"Wish the closet was longer, the parts don't fit as well as I would like and the doors don't connect together for the closet part making them all mini cubes without the cube part all opens separate.",3
115171,"Great product ....while it lasts, which isn’t long. It starts to lose power/strength of vibrations very quickly after first purchasing it and continues to diminish until the product stops working completely. Many speeds that are great and it’s rather strong when it’s operating at its full power capacity. If you’re looking for a quality made product, there are probably better choices but for a (fairly) cheap toy, it works well.",3
104384,The story line was good but not enough love/sex scenes for a romance novel. Maybe I just expect more.,3

105667,You might as well just dump this stuff out and replace it with some apple cider vinegar. It doesn't work as well and dries up fast. It will still kill a few here and there but not as fast as the apple cider vinegar on its own. Save your money and get the large bottle at the store and you'll be fine.,3
193078,love these greeting cards! they're small but adorable. will definitely be buying again.,5
166523,I buy it for my granddaughter to do crafts with. She like the tapes and sticks it on everything. She uses the tapes to decorate her iPhone 6s which with a clear case gives it a one of a kind look. With this pack it gives you 40 different tapes and she loves them all. She put them all in a ziploc bag and has been toting them around like a long lost treasure. This is the second set I have ordered and there will be more orders in the future! Thanks for the great product!,5

65709,"These are nice glasses, however, this is the second time we ordered these, and the second time in two weeks they were shipped with no packing materials...no bubble wrap, no peanuts, no paper, no nothin.' Both sets arrived with broken glasses. Now we have two uneven sets. One set of glasses was shipped with other heavy items and no packaging material...the other was sent in an empty box with no packaging material. I hate to give nice glasses a low rating...it's the shipping that lacks.",2
62893,"These did not work out for me at all. I wear a Women's size 10 medium and these were too small and cramped my toes. The fabric made my feet feel very hot too. I did like how they don't slip around your foot though. Because they were too small for a Women's 10, I returned them.",2
79853,For the price I figured they wouldn’t be as good as the more expensive ones but they are made of extremely thin sheet metal. Have a 1-2” gap around them and do not even include rubber for the edges just a foam round foam sticky pad for the bottom corner. If you aren’t looking for quality or a tight fitting door then these are for you! If you want something that actually seals up the lowers then purchase a different product,2

47801,"Probably dont get this if you need a protector because you drop your phone frequently. I dropped my phone and the entire protector just popped off (because it attaches around the circumference of the screen, unmentioned in the product description) and the entire right side of my screen is all cracked now. Probably fine if you just want to protect your screen from scratches? I guess.... Wishing their ""Lifetime Replacement Warranty"" worked to replace my phone. Also, this thing definitely is not smudge resistant, which isn't important to me, but worth mentioning.",2
