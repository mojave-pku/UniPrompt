I punched the holes into the sandpaper and even ""cleared"" the holes on the other side so that the dust could flow through to the bag. Nothing worked. I detached the bag several times, but all the dust was on my floor, none of it was in the bag. The device holds nicely, feels good to use, but without dust collection, it's useless to me.",3
90448,I bought this for my soaps and it doesn't even leave the scent I wanted.,3
96405,The only reason this gets a 3 star is because my 2 year old loves running around with it. The gun is cheaply made and there is no power to it. The bullets just slide down the barrel. Most of the time the gun jams.,3
92991,Purchased as a gift and they were very impressed,3
83416,Gets the job done-ish... the pentalobe screwdriver strips very easily. The stripping screwdriver combined with the blue cement actually make it really hard to get more than 1 or 2 uses (unscrewing and re-screwing) out of the screwdriver itself. Screws seemed to be perfectly fine however.,3
119423,"She’d is very cheaply made. Floor started separating after shed was built. Ground shed was built on was a level concrete foundation. I ended up buying metal strips at a hardware store and secured the flooring and then placed connectable floor purchased at Costco to give the finished product a nice look. Instructions were pretty easy to follow. Recommended not to built in the sun. Plastic becomes extremely soft and screws will strip easily. Not sure how it will handle the rain being I live in California and it hasn’t started raining yet. I do like the shed, hence is why I gave it a 3 star. A lot of storage space for what ur paying for. I just wish lifetime would make a higher quality product.",3
112924,"Not large like it states. It maybe a bit bigger than others, but in no way is it large. I barely get all my stuff in it, and I don’t have a ton of stuff. Shaving, teeth care, and body stuff. It has tons of pockets though, so that makes up for the lack of space.",3
102962,"So, these colors are very pretty. I used another brand of base and top coat... my daughter and myself both used this brand, and both of our nails peeled off the same day. It’s pretty...maybe we didn’t put on enough?? But I hate that it peeled off so quick.",3
119621,I hate to give negative reviews but I have to since the quality of the product really matters! I took the measurements and ordered the right size. Got it for my MIL who is supposed to wear it everyday! It just arrived 2 days and has been used only for 2 days!,3

93154,"Much better than the less expensive ones I've tried. Does great as an every day type of shaver, but once my hair grows for more than two days, this has a lot of trouble cutting it. The pop-out detailer on the back is underpowered and won't cut it either at that point, so if you don't shave every day you'll need a second appliance or razor to catch up.",3

113623,I didn't think about trying to use this and my car magnet at the same time so instead of being at eye level while driving it's on my seat or else it will fly open. Other than that - it works great. I keep one card in it and it also works well to prop your phone up to watch videos. Is easy to discolor or get dirty during use. If you try to clean it in any way the color just rubs off and the dirt stays.,3

I think they dry out or otherwise lose their durability and after a year or two, it doesn't take more than just wind blowing across the BBQ for them to tear along the places where they meet the edge of the BBQ.

103626,"I bought this bracelet after being in a situation where I needed to charge my phone and no way to do so. I actually had the idea of a wearable usb cable, came on amazon, and found all the wearable cables already offered. I picked up this one due to the reviews and the looks. I think its important to note that all the people leaving bad reviews because of the ""speed"" of this cable, are wrong. This is a standard usb cable. Your data transfer rates, and charging speed, all depend on what your plugging the cable into. Leaving a negative review because of this is foolish. With this said, if your planning on using this to charge, you may want to carry around one of those little usb plugs in your pocket, but if you do that.. whats the point of the bracelet really? Be ok with the fact that it may take 8 hours to fully charge your phone in the car, or carry a plug. I'm leaving a 3 star review based on a few different things. I do like the cable, and it has actually helped me a few times to transfer files when i didnt feel like finding a usb cable. My biggest issue with the cable would be the fact that it does pop off. I have small wrists (im 190 lbs and 6 feet tall). The first time the cable popped off, i was taking out the trash. I felt it come off, and found it easily. No worries. Second time it popped off was at a concert. I didnt feel it, and someone found it and returned it. I would of lost it there if that person didnt happen to see it. There should be some sort of clasp or magnet or something to keep it attatched in my opinion. The product description says its waterproof, and it is. Ive tested it by taking it into the shower daily, and then used the cable to charge my phone. The cable holds moisture for a long while. What i mean by this, is if you take a shower at 8am, and try to use the cable at 10am, you'll get a ""moisture detected"" warning. I cant really fault the cable for doing this, as the page does recommend taking it off during the shower (after stating its waterproof). For me, this cable only works if i keep it on all the time. I'm the type of person that forgets things daily, and having it attatched to me or in my daily carry is the only option, so i tend to keep it on all the time. After about a month of use, the leather on the outside is starting to get somewhat frayed. Not a lot, but very small pieces on the side are coming up. I suspect i'll have another month or two so before it breaks down to the point where i wont use it. A very small point, the edges are a bit sharp. Especially the ones that rest on your wrist. Not a big deal for you, but if you snag someone else with em, you may give em a bit of a scrape. Hugging my son over the weekend, i ended up sliding my bracelet along his back and put a ""cat scratch"" mark on his back. Honestly it was a pretty nasty scratch, or i wouldnt bother to write it. Things to fix : A better locking system, maybe some magnets or a small latch. Round off the edges. Things to make this product sore : Figure out some way to make a foldable plug so people can get a ""fast charge"". Im not a scientist and im not an engineer but surely someone out there smarter than me can get this done.",3
118321,Not waterproof. Stem does not screw down to seal out water.,3

Leaves a lot to be desired and you could do better, which is what people told me after wife #1. Look around and see what else is out there. I did that and found wife #2. Pretty good but still didn't hold up as expected as I am sure neither will this ice bucket. Personally, I'm done with both.",3

115835,"Although this is 'renewed' item, it looked new. I'm not a tech savvy and it was very easy to setup. So, the question is if this helped extend the wifi signal. Yes, but not as much as it claims. My house is an old house with thick plaster walls. I bought several small wifi extenders/repeaters before but none of them gave me long range signal. I did not want to spend over $40 but weak signal was getting annoying so I decided to spend more for this. Disappointed? Yeah, kinda. I put outdoor wireless security camera and needed long range wifi extender. This did give me 'little' more signal than my cheap extenders, enough to operate the outdoor camera. Only ONE exterior wall to pass the signal. I was expecting more than just 'little' improvement. But since it is giving enough signal, I am okay with it. But expected much much more signal.",3

Only problem I’m having- & it’s a pretty big one for me, is the night light turns off after several hours. So my 4 year old has been waking up at three in the morning screaming because she is afraid of the dark and her night light is not on. I wish there was a place I could set the time. I just need it to last 8 hours! Am I doing something wrong or is this just a really bad design flaw? It’s really too bad because other than that we truly love it.",3

85273,"I am no expert on coffee making but I do enjoy making it with the Chemex. Hence the search for a gooseneck kettle. This is a decent kettle - good quality stainless steel, reasonably priced and nice looking with a good ergonomic handle. Originally I had to return the first product since they shipped it to me with both parts (body and cover) taped. The kettle was of course cleaned before use and no tape was visible. However over time after a few uses we noticed the markings of the tape and it started having a burnt smell. Amazon of course replaced the product. I've been using this for quite sometime now and found it to be decent. If you tilt it too much during pouring the water does burst out. However, unless you buy something with rubber in it to regulate the flow it probably will never be perfect. From a health perspective I am willing to forego the water regulation (since I don't want to drink from something with parts other than steel or glass). It also looks much nicer than other gator models out there. So far no rust after several months of use.",3
116095,"Smaller than expected but that’s my fault for not reading reviews and the description. Had I realized the size before I I purchased, I wouldn’t have. My only complaint it that the top comes off so you can get the shapes out, but my one year old will never leave to top on to play. I set the top on for her to play. She likes it and starts to play but then as soon as she tries to get the beads the top lifts off. Wish it had a false bottom instead of a removable top.",3

The only other downside is that I don’t like that there isn’t a seatbelt lock off like most other car seats so I can’t get the snugness that I like when using the seatbelt. Very disappointed because our third row doesn’t have the anchor system. Wish I could return but it’s too late.,3
118615,Comfortable chair only problem I had was the 2 of the casters broke thru the holes they set in,3
101281,"Not bad, but isn't as breathable as I thought it would be.",3
97384,This box was crushed inside the UPS box Hopefully it will work for the child who is receiving it.,3
92559,"It does not have 8gb and the moon's does not work, but that is easy to fix",3
83678,It looks like it would be great but the holes were bigger than expected or should be and i have a big hookah so i didnt think it would be a problem but unfortunately i cannot use,3
104566,Keeps fingers free of nail polish,3
97613,Some of the card images are beautiful while others not so much. Cards are high gloss on thin paper card stock. Easy to shuffle and bend. Book is in color which I like a lot but pretty simple. I know we are supposed to use our own interpretations but for oracle decks I like to read the descriptions when I pull cards for myself. The affirmations are nice but overall I feel like there's something missing here. I don't know what it is exactly but I feel like there could have been more sprinkled into the cards and book. I will use it a few more times before deciding its fate. Maybe as a first oracle deck this would be great but it feels like it missed the mark on so many levels.,3
117386,"Very small bottle, product feels nice on the skin.. not sure if it will improve my skin. I will follow up in a few weeks for any results",3
89857,"My favorite shoes, but they fell apart within a month",3
100717,This cute little plant arrived in excellent condition but unfortunately it didn’t survive. I was very disappointed because I thought it had great potential.,3
84048,"After a difficult assembly, we noticed the damage to the top of storage box that we assume was due to poor packaging. Too late now!!",3
116426,I use this product for everything. I actually bought it bc it’s nice looking and heavy duty. No more crappy scissors. But also I hand wash them and noticed if i don’t wipe them down afterward they rust. That’s sucks.,3
99139,One connector is acting up not seating correctly. Kind of dangerous.,3
108362,Very disappointed because three balloons had holes in them.,3
113897,Cord works great. It just took too long to arrive. Very slow shipping,3
117994,"Fits from edge to edge of the glass which is great but, it will limit you to concern cases you can put on it. Taking a selfie is less quality because the front facing camera is covered with the clear glass. Causes images to be more blurry.",3
111941,They are ok but could be better with the sound,3
103280,This styling spray works well enough but the scent is to strong for me. I wish they would make this product scent free.,3
109195,Coverage was good and had great staying power but it seemed to change to an orange tint by mid morning. This may not be the products fault it may just react with my oils differently.,3
97782,"Good quality, warm but a bit short for my 6'0 husband.",3
91505,"Has what you need for the blue spring upgrade but the included housing is a very cheap quality casing. Mine leaked immediately through the aluminum itself as the casting was poor quality and the aluminum was porous. Just put the spring and seals in my stock housing and issue was solved. The seals and spring are fine, but the housing they send is junk. Check for leaks if you don't reuse your stock housing.",3
115464,"The product is fine. It looks and functions well. However, I have an IPhone XS-Max. It recharges the phone but only if you put it on the dock sideways. They did not take into account the size of the larger phones when designing. So you cannot recharge vertically since the recharging plate does not reach the center of the phone. Not such a big issue but it would’ve been really nice to know when making a decision to get this product.",3
108742,"Can see sew lines every where, was not happy with that, sms after wash even on gentle, becomes very thick in some places and bunches up",3
103336,It's ok. I don't think the sticky ruler will last.,3
107161,This burlap isn’t very strong. We tried to wrap our bushes for winter but it tears too easily. I have used other products that were much more duarable. Will not buy again,3
101668,I should have gotten different size. These ok,3
110902,I like this product but the rings are so much smaller in person and it shows up pinkish for the girls necklace on the screen and it comes in more of a gold color instead,3
115523,Didn’t notice any difference in the way I feel will keep using the rest of the box though it’s got a nice flavor,3
117817,Not much here just sounds and a variaty of sounds. Not impress,3
91719,"book is ok BUT all the illustrations are very small and in black and white so a lot of the detail is not very good. I am very disappointed in this book, I am considering returning it ..",3
107913,"Not shiny like the picture. Great product but if I had known it wasn't gonna look as pretty as the picture, I would have chosen something different.",3
96471,"For the price I paid, I was surprise that the handles didn't click.",3
107068,They’re ok. They have the texture of like a vitamin gummy. Which I didn’t like too much. A little firmer than regular candy gummies The flavor is ok,3
103775,They look good but.i made a mistake And thought they where.for my patriot. As they wont fit the patriot.im returning them. I'm now trying to find the proper ones to fit my patriot,3
85503,its ok with the cookbook.,3
89512,Its a nice feeling messager however for pleasure not powerful enough.,3
89211,"I love the coloration of these. It is way more adult than the pokemon gotcha default bracelet. But the material seems to be weaker. The device in the pokemon gotcha is a repurposed fitness device just with a different os. These bracelets get a little weak after many uses and the tracker/gotcha can pop out if you aren't careful. But they do look better at work than the kiddie colored bracelet. These are pretty cheap though, so when they wear out, I'll just throw them away.",3
114923,I use this as a bather for my babies. It is super easy to install. And for a while it worked beautifully. But after about two months the trigger that adjusts the flow started becoming very hard to move. Now I can only manage a small stream from it. The durability is just not there.,3
93579,"This product is a good workout. The feet flat were you get your feet is not very good quality. Your feet are held on by Velcro I have had it only one month and the Velcro is already starting to wear out. Not a very good design, very cheap.",3
118653,"I would not buy this watch again nor recommend it. I am having a lot of issues with it. Just to name a few: It does not connect correctly with my phone It keep falling because it does not latch correctly, which causes my screen to have a chip I really dislike the phone",3
88537,"Cheap, doesn't look that great. Idk what I was expecting",3
82175,Beautiful projector...was it supposed to include a tripod...other then that its perfect,3
114766,Love the look of this cabinet but not what we expected. The drawers are very small and don't open very far. A bit of difficulty assembling.,3
80728,It's cute and a good size but not even enough balls to cover the bottom of the mat,3
94746,"I wish the holder stood out more, that it doesn't require to tilt your phone to plug in cord to charge. But other than that, it's very durable when holding the phone.",3
91876,It fits my phone and the color matches the online photo but the color is rubbing off.,3
82941,ordered a small and was still too big.,3
118672,"I love the product and the convenience to buy from home, but something isn’t working out on the shipping package and process. I bought it once, all botches spilled, asked for replacement and the second box also came damaged and spilled. What about selling a big refill gallon? Or sending it with a stronger cap and the spray heads separately?",3
104709,"They're cute. I was excited to use them but within 2 weeks and 2 of them have already ripped. I didnt use all 12 so I have some extra, but still. I'm planning on keeping them simply because I dont want to go through the whole return process.",3
92660,This product is a fabulous size and I was very excited to try it out because of its flexible head and nice size but it seems to not hold a charge for very long. It does charge quickly though.,3
117791,"I ordered a size 13, but it looked and felt smaller than a 13. I compared it to my size 13 shoe and it is smaller. Otherwise it's looks great.",3
109917,"Not satisfying, but was okay. Kinda ""meh""",3
115646,"Wish the closet was longer, the parts don't fit as well as I would like and the doors don't connect together for the closet part making them all mini cubes without the cube part all opens separate.",3
88311,"It's definitely not navy blue. It's one to two shades lighter than that depending how the light hits it. If it was an actual navy blue then it would have looked very nice together with the rose gold. Other than that, the case is a tight fitting case. A bit of a struggle to take off, but it's good that it's not loose either. I love the matted feel, which in turn makes it not that slippery on the fingers. All the cuts to the casing fits the buttons, speakers and camera lens perfectly with enough room so that when it falls it won't hurt those areas.",3
86197,Picture is great quality. The down side is that it's very hard to determine what setting the camera is on.,3
80447,"Product fits my daughter's new tablet perfectly and I love the design. I was a little bummed the case came damaged when there was no damage to the outer packaging. My kiddo is 8 so there's no sending it back and waiting for the replacement. Still, I'm happy with the purchase overall",3
96969,I purchased the silver and the light background and the silver numbers are difficult to read.,3
101377,These came packaged in a bag & left in my mailbox. When I opened them they were crinkled in each corner. Not happy with sturdiness or packaging.,3
101855,I'm ok with it... It doesn't have a scent so I'm happy about that...,3
114661,love the graphics. it had problems with error code that did not seem to be anyplace to be found. online instructions did not help. done a hard factory reset and start over. some times trigger dosnt work and game over it has its problems!!!!,3
112762,"When you sell a product and the description starts ""Kota Japan Large Black Granite Mortor..."" the consumer is going to assume it's from Japan. Not declaring (prominently) that it's a product of China with a name like that is deceiving. The quality is reasonable, it seasoned well, and so far has done the job. With China's history of tainted products the fact that it's made of granite is the only reason we kept it.",3
98779,Mechanics are a bit off and the thumb is a bit annoying.,3
85730,It worked perfectly fine for my husband but my face was covered in bruises. If you are having a sensitive skin stay away from this product.,3
116300,Super cute little bit on the small side. The only annoying thing was the fake fur shedding,3
86212,"It seems about two links two long for the 10"" bar. I had to set the tightening screw to the furthest setting, so once it stretches out some (which it will do quickly) it won't be able to stay tight. This is on a Remington Pole Saw. Quick ship. Got it on time.",3
85616,Color was good. Cards move around inside case. Nothing to hold them in place.,3
101887,"Seems to run a little small, but otherwise I do like them.",3
107633,"Order a size up. Too much bunchy fabric in the thumbs, but ok.",3

117051,"Still confused about this story. Was really really good until the end. I don’t understand what happened. The writing totally changed. The story flipped like 3 times at the end of the book. So confused, just left a bad taste. I wish I was warned maybe I would have enjoyed it better. 3 stars for the great story first half of the book. Just can’t understand what happened after that.",3
99218,"I love all the different holders-ALL my shower stuff fits on the caddy.....only issue was it DOESN'T fit over the shower door, had to modify it!",3
92490,Haven't used this yet. Not sure I want to keep it. Its cheap looking,3
102496,"I bought these to shorten to capri/skimmer length. Very light weight, which is good for summer.",3
105751,I was excited for this broom because my mom has one similar and it does a great job cleaning up dust and hair but definitely not the same quality. The broom comes in a few pieces to be assembled and does not stay together that well. I had to use tape to reinforce the connecting pieces.,3
99486,"I’ve bought 2. The first one had agood life and I replaced it due to cover wear. It was still doing it’s job, just looking ratty. The 2nd one started to break within a week. At this point so much has broken off the edges I need to replace it already...after weeks now, not years. I’ll be replacing this with a different brand. Leaving 3 stars because the first case was pretty good, and perhaps I just got a lemon. For the current experience I’d stretch to give it 2.",3
116431,The button jams on me and I have to push hard on the trigger. It is fun to shoot when it does shoot properly. My 5 yr old loves the glow darts. He loves the gun also.,3
115365,Does not hold a lot of tension,3
116935,"It's a great looking shoe. Very comfortable. 3 stars only because they squeak, loudly. Very noticeable by others.",3

107282,Beautiful style dress however the material is really bad...,3
112734,Heavy system to jog with,3
94433,I loved the story and was hooked on the book. Foul language was the biggest complaint I had but still a great book.,3
91976,Does it’s job don’t get me wrong but it felt like half the can was air lol just felt I only did one break job barely used it and it was gon but it does work,3
86908,don't really like the fit can't use them on the tread mill them keep coming off,3
94651,Does a mediocre job on floors... the mapping AI isn't great and it often goes back over its path and misses others. Also doesn't seem to do it's scheduled jobs.,3
81729,"Ordered 2 hats for my parents. One was fine, the other was broke. The velcro strap on back of hat was poorly stitched to hat and it came off. My mother said it was fine and she would sew it back on. I didnt return but disappointed with quality",3
89014,"Hi I'm not sure what went wrong with this book, not the story, that was fine, but the editing was appalling! Missing lines, so many incorrect words. I don't recall any major problems with the other books in the series (mind you I am fairly tolerant of typos and occasional grammar errors) but I don't think there was a page in this book that didn't have something that grated on my nerves, my auto correct was working overtime. That being said I did enjoy the story and will give it another chance if there is another book, I just wonder if the wrong file was used because if not then you really need to get an editor that understands english. It would have been given more stars if not for the editing.",3
83592,"Really cute and comfortable, but as other reviewers have mentioned - they really stink. I put them outside, but that didn't do much. Today I put them in a paper bag with a box of baking soda. I hope it works, otherwise, they will be unwearable.",3
106770,It’s not summer yet so I can’t compare how this keeps food cold to the igloo product that I had used for 10 years. But This isn’t as well built if I just feel for the open space between the edges of insulation. I can tell that is where most of the heat will escape. The plastic fasteners (D-rings and such) are thinner. Sort of wished I limited my search by brands. I think Amazon missed the mark on their “Best Choice”,3
99936,"The headphones broke withing a few days. The other items are still working, but don't expect them to last long, they feel cheap.",3
85838,These were fat socks but not comfortable!,3

81627,"Nice assortment, decent price",3
102919,It’s just ok . The ponytail was little difficult to put on and the bangs was not easy to put on either. Shouldn’t be so hard to put on my head. Overall just ok 👌🏽,3
99110,"At times, had problems interfacing",3
84021,I needed a bigger band. This is just the same size as the origina.,3
107125,The knife part is dull but this may be to prevent cuts. I sharpened it after the fact.,3
115329,Product was shipped without the hardware. Big factor in selection of product. Contacted Amazon and the rep stated they would credit cost of hardware - never happened.,3
101626,"Everything is pretty good with this but the image quality is not great. I had a cheaper model from another company that fell apart but had a nice clean image. This one is built better, but the image quality is not as good. I'll try and find a use for it though. It does sync with an Android phone fine.",3
119344,I like the quality however the cap is way too big even for a large head. I recommend you order small size or extra small,3
110794,"Not a hard shell. Plastic gives easily. Expected something more sturdy. Doesn’t hold as much as nylon or other soft sided luggage. Easy to spot in airport, looks good in orange but somewhat disappointing.",3
113063,opening too small to see the entire license plate and starting to pit & loose black color details after only a few months,3
109962,I bought this for a nervous kitty. Seemed to work and make her relaxed and not be scared. Worked almost immediately. Had a strange salty like smell. Put it in my bedroom and felt super sick while I was sleeping. Unplugged it but still got sick. Won't use again even though it worked for my kitty.,3
103546,I like the item but was disappointed that it arrived with tears in the material.,3
92135,"I like the look of the protector, but I dropped my phone the day after putting on this case and the screen shattered. It did not compare to the OtterBox commuter case I had in protection.",3
94122,The bag popped during shipping.,3
80918,Love the product but don't like the return policy. The 3 lb bag arrived half empty and sugar spilled all over the box because of a large hole in the bag. When I carried the box through the house and opened it in the living room which means sugar was all over the house. I'm kind of upset that I can't do anything about it because of the no return policy. The product itself is GREAT! I switched to Lakanto Monkfruit last year and it's the only sugar replacement I use. I would buy this again (hopefully without the damaged bag next time lol),3
115882,Not what I needed and had easy return. No hassles. Thanks,3

86822,"I usually love Patricia Rice books but this one I just liked. I found the main character, Beatrice, to be a little too stupid for me to like.",3
98928,It's pretty but after just a few weeks of using it the handle became loose and there is no way to tighten it. It still works fine and looks good but I expected a better made product.,3
97736,"With such a big scent, I really cannot appreciate.",3
87997,The plastic mixing pan stains. I'm not sure I like wasting paint in the small reservoirs I forget what I put in each one. Every artist is different.,3
108804,The shoes seem to require one size larger the typical new balance,3
116484,This shirt was just all wrong for me. The color seemed more like dull dirty biege. The waist cut did not feel right at all. Would be better straight with a release pleat. Pleated neckline with the petal sleeve was too busy for me. Returned.,3
96577,Works well but material is cheap. Has one small leak even though I used plumbers tape. Water pressure is great if you remove the water saving device. The control to change from shower to hand held is awkward. I don’t expect that this will last forever. But I am willing to use it until it breaks and buy another higher quality one next time,3
114885,very thin cracks easily,3
75526,The handle broke after a few days. :( I still like having the ability to use a straw tho.,2
72429,the description was very misleading and the manual was so small you could not read the letters,2
44735,This case files book sucks. Save your money and get something else. Not enough depth for shelf exams. Maybe useful as a review for step 2 but doubt it’s better than first aid.,2
75430,"I should have figure out the size more before I bought this. For the price, it's tiny.",2

67553,The light up tool was good while it lasted. It cracked and broke where it connects the interchangeable tips.,2
41601,"I bought this as an alternative to the metal spring traps, thinking it would be easier to set and more effective.

78582,"Both handles are loose, not happy with that!",2
70619,"It fit fine, but the material was so bad that I put it on and the straps immediately came apart, so I got it hemmed and had it fixed, and it still ended up coming apart the following day that I wore it. Really pretty and fit well but the material is awful.",2
42049,I’ve only been using this for 2 weeks and the lid mechanism already broke... pretty disappointed with this...,2
62246,"I ordered this to easily flip meat. One of the tongs, however, cam bent and broken. I don't recommend buying a broken product. It wasn't surprising that the tongs came dirty and you should clean them anyways, but these were surprisingly dirty.",2
44496,"Overall, the product is usable but I would definitely not purchase again. When I was preparing it for use, the crimp on the cable used to hang it came loose. I did repair it with a new crimp but this is ridiculous. Just another poorly manufactured Chinese product.",2
76705,This pen is short and not easy to hold unless you were a child with small hands. I am a female with small hands and it's too small for me.,2

50671,These gloves don't warm your fingers at all (which was what I was really looking for). The middle part of the glove is only luke warm. I think I ordered a large (which is what I wear in a golf glove) and they were way too big for me.,2
51395,"I am so disappointed by this case, and this was not at all what I was expecting. The camera cut out does not stick out all that much, so if you were to drop your phone or slide it on the table, I wouldn't be surprised about the camera being scratched! The case isn't ugly, I just hate that the camera cutout isn't higher. I will more than likely be returning this phone case.",2
50582,Good but it arrived without sling,2
69777,I had to make my own holes didn't fit oem ones,2

69055,"I have been giving to my cat for about 2 months. It appears to really dehydrate her. I am not convinced this works, but I will try until the second bottle is empty. she consumes with her food so there has been no problem getting her to take this.

72718,These are great beginner books. 2 stars because they were shipped “brand new” but arrived with broken spines. They need to be shipped in something more sturdy so they are not folded in transit.,2
40600,Wasn’t what I was wanting for my red foot tortoises. Makes things too dry,2
54393,"We bought 2 for wasps and wood bees. Not very effective for us. Caught a few bugs, but definitely not worth the money for their effectiveness.",2

52926,I bought this for my 9 year old for his birthday . It only works sometimes when you point the remote control directly at the spider. I don't understand how it can be labeled a prank toy when it is so loud and the controller can't be more than a foot from it for it to work sometimes. I would return it immediately if my son didn't rip the box open in excitement. very disappointing.,2

64677,"I needed two of these for two bathroom fixtures and bought this 3-pack. Given the expected life I thought I'd never be able to find the 3rd one by the time one stopped working. Sadly, this has not been the case. The 1st one failed in about 9 months of daily usage, and I dug around to find the 3rd and replace that one. This last week 1 yr and 4 months after installation, the 2nd one is flickering and failed. I liked the light quality, price and energy savings, but with the short life, I would not recommend anyone buy these.",2

63602,"I really like the pattern, size and how much it holds without vexing obnoxiously large, but the reason this only gets two stars is because of how the bag closes. It only has one piece of velcro in the center and the flap that attaches is too long so it leaves a gap. The sides of the top don’t attach at all leaving even larger gaps. While the inside of the bag is insulated it doesn’t really matter because all the cold (or hot) air comes directly out of the top. I used clips to hold the sides closed since I already bought it and want to get a good use out of it. Would not buy again for this reason.",2

They loaded fine and printed many pages (I'm a school teacher, so I use my printer several times daily.) With the second order, the first cartridge I put in leaked ink all over and did not work at all. The other in the twin pack worked fine. Overall, I'm bummed the one didn't work out but thought it was a good buy for the money. Since it's much cheaper then buying new, I took my loss. Third time I bought the twin pack, the first cartridge wouldn't be recognized in the printer but the second one has worked so far (two days.) I'm done buying these because it's not worth the hassle of thinking your getting two and then really only getting ONE that works.",2

I understand that 5 year olds can occasionally be tough and drop things but it does not hold like the amazon fire tablet. So if you are looking for something to last I would not go with this.

The left prism is set too far to the left so when I look thru them a good 1/8th to 1/4 of my vision is obstructed, which also makes the view look like theres a ghost image in the middle of my vision.

78813,"Ok, so I use eneloop and these are just not as well designed. They work, but because you have the battery able to slide out the other side, it just makes it annoyingly hard to put it in some devices. I was trying it on the Disney Car's Mater, the large one. Based on how it fits in there, should be too hard. But every time I tried, the batter would slide out one side or the other. The eneloop sizers have a lock and cap, so the AA doesn't slide. I guess this still works in cases where you rarely change the batteries. In that case, it may be worth it to get annoyed once in a while but save a lot of money.",2
54577,"These are cheap for a reason. The taste is alright, but the shape of the pods is not exactly the same as real Nespresso pods and these leak water/espresso all over the place while brewing. Every time I make one I have to soak up the mess and it's really not worth it. They need to redesign the pods entirely to match real Nespresso pods.

The meh: The instructions for could be a little better as it did take me several tries before I fully understood how to fold it. The wheels are small, so they are more likely to get stuck on rough terrain, even sidewalk cracks.

I tried super glue, hoping I could get a little more use from it, but it didn't hold. I almost decided to order another one since I truly liked the style, but instead am trying a different type to see if it holds up a bit longer.",2

66218,I was initially impressed with this collar. It is sturdy and thick. I loved the metal clasp and the adjustability. The handle on it was helpful as my dog easily slips out of other collars. This collar lasted approximately one month. The clasp broke. I was disappointed to say the least.,2

So I charged the battery. Drove again and then I checked the unit with my phone before turning the key on. It said the battery was weak, which I knew and began to realize the unit was staying hot all the time with the ability to bluetooth to my phone. So, if you have a weak battery or do not drive frequently, you might not want to leave the unit plugged in all the time. I keep mine in the glove box.",2
55902,It falls off hook too easily. Really a pain.,2
61175,"It's a hassle to take it out of the band, charge it, and start it. I still haven't figured it out completely yet..",2

77094,Some work better than others,2
68655,Very pretty and received compliments but wore it once and it broke :(!! The hinges that hold necklace parts together are too thin and open up easily,2
54430,"So it worked for about 2 times shooting it, I only used the laser for a total of 8 minutes then it dimmed to where I could barley see it, then I tried some shooting at night with the flashlight and that stayed on for about 30-45 minutes before it completely shut off and wouldn’t turn back on",2
62286,"2 stars because the product seems to work okay but jeez, it looks like the packaging was sent through a wood chucker before or during shipping",2
58675,Adorable little guy. Sad it's pealing + will come out of tank with next water change.,2

65388,"Product is decent quality, but it does not fit like pictured. Maybe sizing up would be better for a looser fit in the bust and shoulders. Had to return.",2
65204,Was really hoping my dog would love but he won’t even touch it. Got a dog tooth brush that was a different shape and he loved it.,2
79160,"The fact that this stool had lots of rave reviews plus the low price convinced me to buy it. That was a mistake. Many reviews touted how the buyers' large bodies fit so well and comfortably even over uneven surfaces. I am 5', 100 lbs, and when I put my meager behind on this stool it feels wobbly and unsafe. It has tipped over and in constant danger of doing so again. I deeply regret buying this item.",2
62057,Cutting edges were burred and jagged after initial inspection.,2
59333,The sound quality is very poor and it will turn itself on even if you don’t want it on. I would buy a better quality item.,2
77372,"The first night I used this it was great, the next morning my chest was wrinkle free. However, by the fourth Night the pad would hardly stick. I followed all directions about not using lotions, etc. I'm thinking of buying a bottle of body glue to see if I can extend the life of this product since the results were good when it did stick.",2
61828,This was a terrible film. It had so much potential but disappointed totally.,2
64207,I wanted to buy these glasses to flex on some people. When I put them on I found out for an average male head they are too small to fit on my head. My girlfriend had no issue and they worked great but it just was too small for me and so I returned them.,2
70890,I received this without 5 free application gloves. Doesn't last long at all. It will dry your skin out,2
65275,This was not for a full size crib,2
55710,The photo shows two bottles and I only received one.. very disappointing ;( the low rating is due to deceptive advertising,2
51680,It worked perfectly fine for 11 months and 3 weeks.,2
70769,"Got 2 of these and liked them but now I've noticed that one of them does not last very long. Not impressed. I use it for my phone and kids tablets, cant use it for my heated vest. With in 15 min. It dies on the power, wife has a 10000 that last 10 times longer in the heated vest.",2
53515,Although the color is good and the durability is fine this product does not deliver as read there is no tummy control at all none there comfortable pair of shorts but sad to say i purchased for tummy control though i did keep them due to how comfortable they actually are.,2

41341,Stopped filing well after only a few uses.,2
62333,"Cute, fit well everywhere else but the armholes. It had a weird cut that made it uncomfortable. Had to return.",2
53381,Had to wait for the correct shirt to be shipped.,2
79759,"Just looks very fake no matter what you do. The hair itself is great, just too thick and its too blunt cut for me. I wish I did not have to return it.",2
76212,"These worked well for approximately 3 months. Then within the last 2 weeks 3 out of the 4 cables stopped working. Only one of them is slightly frayed and the other two have no visible damage, but they just won’t charge my phone. Just out of the blue they stopped charging and I’m not sure what happened. Unfortunate because they are a good deal but they just don’t last.",2
59548,"The bag seems nice, Ill fin out n my trip.

50718,"I guess I made the mistake of assuming a product was good based off reviews. I love cold brew and use a toddy to make mine and decided to give this stuff a try. It's pretty smooth but it has no flavor profile, and for a dark roast it's not at all bold and forward. It almost tastes like nothing. There's no way this can possibly have this many legit 5-star reviews and be so popular. Avoid this stuff.",2
63052,"Heater works good but the fan is too loud. This would be great for a game room or something, but to have in a bedroom when you trying to sleep - forget it!",2
154313,"Originally purchased for my kid to bring to school. We have a large Time Timer at home that works great. This one provides the visual time, is easy for my kiddo to set, has a magnetic back, and is a good price. Unfortunately, it ticks really loud... too loud for classroom use... So we have another at home timer. Otherwise it is great.",4
133697,"Pretty good quality for the price. Stays on head easily, which is important when used for an ice show.",4
141671,I really like this helpful for my motorcycle,4
140957,"Super cute little summer outfit. The quality is not quite as good as some other baby outfits I've ordered on Amazon - there were a few loose threads, etc. Overall, I am happy however.",4
143264,This works very well as an enhancement to my dogs kibble.,4

133638,"Bought this for my son as he kept getting his leg stuck in his crib and I was afraid he would hurt himself. I used his crib mattress and since he rolls off it I had to buy a rail to keep him in until he’s a little older. I really like it. It’s super easy to put together and wash. I really only have 2 complaints. 1. There was something on this that broke out the skin on his face so I washed it and it got better. 2. The sides will not pull tight enough so my son doesn’t fall in the sides. He likes to push up on the sides of his bed when he sleeps. But other than those 2 issues, 1 of which was easily resolved its worth buying!",4
145679,"It was really cute until I dropped it and it completely shattered. For someone as clumsy as myself, I wouldn’t recommend it because it won’t survive any fall.",4
147601,You've got to retie the drawstring knots if you're going to carry heavier weight but it's a solid bag.,4
155430,Everything I like except you might have to buy a splitter if you want to use it with a pc for sound and mic. Luckily I already had the cable from my previous headset. For the price you would think it would be included. The ear pads feel a bit awkward but don't push on my glasses. After 2 hours they are still quite comfortable.,4
126594,A beautiful story of the unconditional love between an animal and a human. Nothing else compares to it nor touches the heart deeper.,4
141893,"Pros: Cheap x2, breathable, comfortable Con: I feel like you can see my dingus ‘cause they’re so lightweight. Currently unsure if/how this will affect my/other people’s workouts.",4
155755,Not sure this will hold up well. My previous Blue Sky planners had laminated covers this one does not. My others also had an inside pocket which I will miss. I didn’t notice it was missing until I already wrote in the planner. Otherwise I would have returned it.,4
138175,"These high waisted pants are wonderful. The color is super fun and they are beyond comfortable. I am a big fan of high waisted work out pants vs regular waist line. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that I would have liked a bit more compression, which is what I was expecting based on the name of the pants. However, these will be perfect for my home workouts and running errands.",4
152078,Colors are bright. However it's taken a lot of shaking of the markers and flipping the tips in order to get the chalks to work.,4
141253,Was very cute and my 8 year old loved it!,4
125639,it is great but if they had a smaller size it would be even better for the future,4
129864,Don't like the small filter every other aspect great .made a new filter out of a paper pleated water filter. Works great,4
126396,easy to use and a good price,4
151927,Just like I would buy at the hardware store (don't stock any more). I wish it was not so expensive - otherwise I would rate it 5 stars.,4
159700,"Excellent product, it is really great for the price, I like it very much",4
127755,You said it was handed directly to a resident. How could that be. Nobody was home !!??,4
141593,Loved everything about them but were super skinny. Fit my waist and thighs but way too snug on my lower legs. I recomend considering to order a size up. I had to return them.,4
130058,Loved it!! It was perfect for my brisket! Will definitely need more in the future!,4

139200,"I did a lot of reading before I bought any CBD products for my dog, because I wanted to make sure it would be ok for my pets. One of my dogs (we'll call him Barky!) is very high energy and gets stressed out whenever we have people over or have to travel anywhere. Honest Paws really seemed to relax Barky and he looooves the treats so worthwhile as just a snack for him. Glad I gave this a try.",4
122704,Great natural product. Look really nice in my herb and tomato garden,4
139762,It's just a little febreze pack on the vaccum bag... does smell nice!,4

132375,"This is a nice 5 hook wall mount rack but it's not perfect. There are some quality control issues with the unit that I received. It comes nicely packaged and includes the necessary screws for wall mounting. The item I received had some small scratches/dents which are noticeable on a laminated white surface. Furthermore, one of the hooks is not cut out evenly, leading to visible angled and not a straight cut when the hooks are not in use. For 30$ hooks, I had presumed that the company would pay a little more attention to detail and quality control. Overall a nice unit but some QA need to be fixed. Update*** Bought another for living room and love the quality, the wooden / walnut color with black hooks is beautiful.",4
123725,I think it should have the Bluetooth selfie button included,4
157809,"Purchased as a gift for my mom, she says it’s very easy to use but doesn’t heat up as fast as she would like but over all she really likes it. She said her favorite thing to cook in there is chicken and it comes out really juicy. Which we all know is easy to dry out so that’s a good thing.",4
135322,The pads help and I appreciate them!,4
124002,"This is a great case for a 17.3 inch laptop which is my favorite size. However, the bag is not that padded. It would not protect the laptop well if it were accidentally dropped. I had one before that was well-padded, but had to get a new one. Overall, it is good, but I think it should have more padding to protect the laptop.",4
135608,Love the look of this suit ordered one size up a large and it is little big. Did have a snag in it but no time to return,4
152160,I like this establishment.,4

124071,Super comfortable but the waist is way too big for me. 5'6 140lbs and ordered a medium,4
157295,I love this battery case! It fits my iPhone 8plus very well. It stays charged for a long time.,4
133176,Love these sports bras and wear them all the time! They fit perfectly. Only giving 4/5 stars because the cups come out in the wash pretty easily.,4

129927,"We did a lot of research before buying this toaster. You'd be surprised how many bad things people can say about a toaster. This one has great reviews so decided to give it a try. It toasts very well and evenly. Relatively cool on the outside too when toasting. However, it came with a huge dent across the body on one side. Was going to exchange for a new one, but Amazon customer service handled it very well, as always! We decided to keep it for a partial refund, to avoid several more days of waiting without a toaster. All in all very satisfied.",4
120401,These are super cute. They look nicer in person. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are very wide. But other than that they are great.,4
158037,"Warm, heavy boot socks. Arrived on time and in good condition.",4

121839,I liked that it felt well made.easy to use.,4
124755,I really liked this book. Sweet not too over the top with the sex scenes. It was heart reaching and loving at the same time. Although I could have already predicted who did what I still couldn't put down this book. I eager to finish it.,4

159076,"I ordered set of four Mopar speakers for my JK. Order was received rather quickly but upon opening the box, I found two speakers and not the set of four. So disappointed because weekend has come and I can't update my Jeep. I have contacted seller to try to resolve this matter. Once I receive other two speakers I will change/update my review. Update: Seller sent the two missing speakers. The upgrade was worth it. Speakers are plug and play and sound so much better.",4
140632,"Sleeve offers great compression, really helps my tendonitis. Gave 4 stars because the copper healthy emblem and print started wearing off on 2nd days and looked really bad. After a few days was worn enough to peel the rest. Other than that I highly recommend.",4
137853,Saw this at a friend's. Had to get one for myself to replace the paper plate. 2 for the price of 1 with this company but they come in a bag with no marking or explanation so you may have to put a note in it if you gift it. Other than that I love it. Kept one. Gave one. :),4

127990,Very nice phone case.,4
145129,well made and good quality.,4
135348,Pay attention to the size. They are small earrings but were purchased to replace studs that were damaged. These are tiny. I would not recommend for primary earrings but they work well for graduated studs in the lower lobe.,4
123184,"I own 3 of these in different colors. Good binder, suits the needs for my Star Wars Destiny cards as good as the other X brand but much better price. Thicker band is nice, and just like the other brand, I can fit comfortably 2 cards each slot, front and back. They slide around slightly, but not enough for it to be an issue or even fall out of their pockets.They will also fit sleeved cards as well, will be tight and possibly stretch the pocket if you try and double them up sleeved though.",4
130951,"It is a little bit smaller than I thought it would be, the size of a fat marker, but it works great, and it is just what I needed. It arrived on time, and just as described.",4
142521,This is a cute shirt to wear with my jeans.,4
158864,I will be using this with my teardrop camper. I’m excited since it is much easier to set up and take down than a canopy. It would be nice to have a wind shield door as well since I camp in cold weather as well as heat. I could also then use it as a changing tent.,4
124836,"Heats well, muted but audible whistle, holds a reasonable amount of water. Watch for steam getting under the handle, but otherwise it's great. Also, I love the color. :) We drink a LOT of tea, and also use it to boil water for rinsing out the drain.",4

154264,"As advertised, no surprises.",4
126571,My 4 1/2 year old really likes it.,4
155287,Gave this as a birthday gift for my sister. She loves it. Easy to follow directions. Fun game for mixed audiences.,4
151418,"I like it. Nice texture, well made. Fits my leather love seat that has big arm rests, wasn't sure it would but it fits nicely. It comes out of the area between the back and seat easily but the little plastic rolls help with that.",4
138513,Works great in my Kohler low profile toilet. Used it to replace the original fill valve which never worked that well and did not fit well in the tank. Only negative is that this does not include the fill tube which seems like it would be easy to include.,4
157348,My family loves soup. This ladle is great since it can separate out the solids from the liquid for the picky ones who only likes to drink the soup or those that enjoy the solids with the soup. It is stainless steel so easy to clean. The one negative about this ladle is that it is larger than expected and therefore hard to store in my kitchen supplies drawer.,4
154836,This very large version of the game really helped me due to my low vision. I can actually read the letter tiles without magnification help which I need on the other versions. But it took two tries since the first game I got came with over half the alphabet missing. Had to send the first one back. Check out the letters before completely unpacking.,4

140218,This is a brand new book about SEO and I successfully complete reading this book. This was very easy to read and learning. Every topics is discussed by marked pictures so there no chance to fall in confusion. From my personal opinion I like this book so much and I will use it when I need to do SEO. Overall I'm satisfied.,4
129214,"I really enjoyed this book and could hardly put it down. Hillerman writes tightly plotted mystery stories which make for great reading. He also, through his main characters and the settings, gives us insight into Navajo culture and beliefs. I love great reads where you also learn about other cultures.",4
129168,Well made! Next they need to come out with one that has a charging pad for the phones. But it’s cute and stylish!,4
130343,"Really pretty and well made, except for the clasp which is so small and oddly placed, it's impossible to put on by yourself, without turning it around.",4

129460,"I bought the blue print and the print covers up the fact the suit is a little loose in the bottom for my slim hips. But not loose enough to make me return it. I'm 5'6"" and weigh 130, with a 36C bust, 30 inch waist and 38 inch hips. the medium works ok - the small would be too small in the bust. For the price, this is an excellent suit. If I tighten the straps I get pretty good support. I love that it shapes me a little without feeling like spanx!",4

121348,"Not only functions as described but even better. Works better then similar more expensive products This is a quality, well made product that should be an addition to every older mans' collection . Keeps things happening. In addition to the better and stronger erection it increases sensitivity and overall enjoyment. Although the instructions suggest using for 10 minutes at a time, you need to work up to 10 minutes . Use lube as recommended.",4
131071,Service was good case was cheaply made,4
158536,The socks shipped fast but they were definitely way smaller than the “one size” fits all. Be cautious if you have larger feet.,4

154020,"My son is 6 feet and weighs approx. 165 lbs. The large fit him much better than the M. He wont really zip it up, and this is great for that.",4
158844,"Overall an enjoyable read that kept me guessing. You can tell a lot of research has gone into this, which, however, makes it disappointing that some of the German terms injected into sentences are incorrect or spelled wrong.",4
159513,Very interesting reading. Great characters. There is good and bad in each of us. I recommend this author's work. Enjoy,4
141621,they are very comfortable,4
140877,I got my product and I love it. I’m still learning how to use it. I gave four stars because it didn’t come with any adapter. Only a short usb cable. I had to get one from the store.,4
123839,"Paid for itself in first use. I resized about 5 watches in under 2 hours and did everything from replacing spring bars to watch bands. Didn’t use battery removal tool because I read on reviews this didn’t have a piece to compress the watch backs after opening and indeed it doesn’t! But for $12 it’s worth the price. The quality of the tools is 4 stars, the 2 pronged pin punch broke on one side but other than that it’s worth it. Only one broke and I didn’t really need it so it’s a steal at this price. Do it!",4
149633,"Not disappointed. Read the reviews and knew the pine scent wouldn't last very long. And, that's ok. Wanted it mostly for the ""big fellow"".",4
150646,I really liked the fit and the sturdiness of this product!,4
138466,"This was pretty much as expected. It works well enough for what I need (power a hot wire foam cutter) and the instructions are relatively clear. I didn't like that it requires you to jump it manually to adjust some of the settings, so I knocked it down a star, but that is really the only bad thing I can say about it.",4
137704,The quality is what you would expect from a 20$ watch but it's actually pretty solid given that it's so cheap. It's unique and I get a lot of comments when I go out about what my watch it.,4
120113,Colors names difficult to read even w/glasses. Shiny. Just saying...,4
137599,Perfect for camping and occasional use. Better than some restrooms.,4
129040,"These wireless ear buds are a great value. Turning them on and off are a little finicky because you have to hold the touch button. Other than that they work great. Battery life is okay, but that’s to be expected from a wireless ear bud",4

153485,"I like the reflective strip in the front, but when it’s opened wider in the front to accommodate a larger dog, it doesn’t seem as comfortable for the dog. The side of the strap that lies against the chest has exposed Velcro that can rub.",4
157709,Would have been five stars - appearance and quality both extremely good. Two minor gripes you should be aware of if considering these - both noted in other reviews. My wife loves heated seats which are not nearly as effective in our Wrangler with these covers on. Other issue is minor shifting / sliding on front seats in particular. Three kids and a golden don't seem to have any problems in the back but both front seats require a little shifting when you settle in. Could just be the way you climb into a Jeep. If you're looking for a summertime cover from the elements - these are perfect. Subtle and sharp.,4
139481,I've been using this for years. I put it on every morning just before my socks and shoes. It works well temporarily but doesn't help my heels long term. It's really the only thing that helps though. I have tried tons of foot creams and this works the best.,4

126028,"This playset is larger than I was expecting from the Polly Pocket line, but it's well made and lots of fun",4
135732,"4 month update: My fix was still going strong when someone at work decided that I didn't need the thermos anymore and gladly swiped it from me. I guess they saw how much I liked it and decided it was easier to steal than buy one themselves. So here I am back to buy another one. Going to use the same O-ring fix I described before on this one to keep the silicone piece in place. Seriously, try it if you are having that problem. It works good. Original Review/fix So when I bought this thermos, I read a lot of reviews that people were having problems with the lid. Where the silicone piece would get loose and the lid would fail to open when you push the button. I read that a lot of people were buying new lids from the manufacturer because the silicone piece was not able to be purchased by itself. Well I'm not sure if the silicone piece just ended up getting loose over time, but the problem with mine was shortly after I bought it, that silicone piece started slipping off the lip that is on the cap. So I was trying to figure a way to keep that from happening, and this is what I came up with. Go to Lowe's and buy the delta o-ring set for repairing a faucet. I included a picture with the model number. It has four o rings, they are the same diameter but 2 are thicker. Well I took off the white silicone piece that seals the lid, and I put the two thicker O-rings over the circular area and pushed them down so that the silicone piece that opens the lid cannot slip over the lip. Then I put one of the smaller O-rings at the top of the other two to keep them from moving up. Pictures are included to kind of show you what I did. I've been using it about a week and so far so good. Now if that silicone piece that opens the lid gets too loose then I imagine it will eventually stop opening the lid but my solution fixes it from slipping over the lip. Hope this helps somebody else out there.",4

123863,"My husband and I recently laid sheet vinyl ourselves in our kitchen. Being the complete newbies in DIY flooring we are, there were very noticable seams in the floor where a new sheet began so I wanted a rug big enough to cover them up. I wanted a 4 ft x 5 ft rug because that's how big my space was, and this was one of the only ones I could find in the material/colors I wanted in that size. Our flooring is true white & gray hexagon sheet vinyl. I read reviews that said that the rug was definitely off-white instead of true white, but i loved the print, the size and the material seemed perfect for a kitchen. Since our flooring is so stark white,by comparison it makes the rug seem even more brown than white. But, we plan to paint our lower cabinets black and install butcher block wood countertops so I'm thinking the colors of the rug will match better (the off-white/brown colors in the rug will pop with the countertops). So, to summarize, PROS: -I LOVE the pattern of the rug -the material seems very easy to clean in a kitchen (or outdoors) -it is pretty soft (not plasticy or scratchy like some rugs) considering it can be used as an outdoor rug -the size fits perfect in my space -THE PRICE IS AMAZING. BEST VALUE! CONS: -if you're putting the rug against a stark white floor or furniture, the rug will appear to be BROWN rather than off-white",4

The parts did not fit together tightly and one of the dividers would fall out of place. I just took a little loctite super glue and ran it along the joints. Now everything is nice and sturdy.

I removed the protector with an Xacto knife and it works now. Kind of sucks though since now I have to spend $10 for a glass screen protector.

4560,"I purchased this one after I found out the 2 others I purchased from an on-line pet store were going to take 3-4 weeks to get to me. With a new puppy I needed one asap. So I purchased this one. What a disappointment! The ""mesh"" net was thin and easily ripped by puppy claws. There were NO directions with how to place it. The wall mounts were weak and fell off after one day. I was so upset thinking that the other 2 were going to be the same way and couldn't imagine why this net was highly rated. WELL when the other 2 came they were of much better quality. The mesh net was strong and solid, the wall attachments were big and once I stuck them on the wall there was no getting them off! There was a nice 1 page explanation of how to place the wall attachments to assure the gate worked best. WHAT a difference! The puppy has pawed at it several times and has not ripped it nor has the pressure he placed on the mesh torn the wall attachments off the wall - BOTH of which happened with this cheap version.

I purchased this stroller to make the trip easier however after having used the stroller a week before traveling the wheel some how got cracked and caused it to wobble and not properly maneuver the stroller. I realized the cause for the maneuver issue at the airport, and I wish I had saved the money and just stuck with my jogger/stroller since it is a LOT more sturdy and that wouldn't have happened. I also did not realize the height of the handles being an issue until had had lengthy use for it, i am 5'6 and the handles are a bit short for me. Update: I got in touch with the seller and they reached out to the manufacture since they are not the ones to keep parts on hand. I received the new wheel and replaced the broken wheel, however it is still struggling to maneuver properly and it is really frustrating because I'm not sure what to do with it",1

34156,"I regret buying this product. HISTORY: I listen to my iPhone a lot in my car. This was no problem with my iPhone 6 and my 3.5mm cord. When Apple decided to remove the headphone jack from their phones, I had no way to play my music in my car. Enter, AUKEY. I purchased an older model in the summer of 2017. It worked really well: press/hold to turn on, press/hold to turn off. Very often, I listen to videos on Youtube which conveniently has a speaker option so I can verbally say what I want to hear and it will pull it up. One year later, my old AUKEY was dead. I bought THIS model - an upgraded model. It seemed to be the same (albeit rectangular instead of square) and used bluetooth. It connected right away. It turns on with no problem and I can play my phone's music through my car speakers. HOWEVER. Using the AUKEY prevents the speaker function in Youtube from working, entirely. Without the connection established, it works every time with zero problem. With AUKEY turned on, it simply breaks this function of the app. I have no idea why that happens. Second, when you try to turn the AUKEY device off, IT LAUNCHES SIRI. You can't turn it off! I've tested this at least 20 times over multiple days and each and every time, it pulls Siri up on your phone. You have to disconnect Bluetooth from your phone to turn off the AUKEY device. I went from someone who pressed one button and spoke outloud once in a great while to someone who constantly has to fiddle with her phone. I'm shocked it breaks a function of an app and concerned it's launching Siri and not turning off without significant interaction. I never had this problem with the old model - my biggest problem there was it only lasted one year. This one is possessed by some anti-youtube ghost who refuses to let the device shut off. It's sad, because I can't use it for the reason I bought it.",1
39595,Not impressed. Came in a big amazon box with a few bubble for cushion. Did absolutely nothing for it. Bounced around box. Because All the edges crushed n had a big crack.

Someone could easily walk off with the rack and all the bikes by simply undoing the hi-lo from the car. The only other solution is getting a long enough cable to lock the bike rack to the trailer hitch. This is definitely a weak point in security. Doesn’t give me any peace of mind. You might say, why not just get your own hitch lock? You can’t. The holes are threaded and only receives the provided bolt.",1

These are not rubber mats, but are recycled plastic(must be cheap to make, and high profit).

10624,"UPDATE: the first fountain I received was a lemon. After over a month of trying to get Amazon and/or the company to respond, the company finally responded and send a replacement pump. This one crapped out in 36 hours. Amazon is so big now that they don't know when they're selling knock offs and lemons. The ratio of good products to lemons is shifting in favor of lemons. Old review: This is a great product when it works, BUT: We purchased this item a little over one month ago. We set it up and began using it about three days after it arrived. Within the month of purchasing it, it has broken in different ways six times. The first 5, my husband was able to repair it himself. However, the sixth time, the necessary repairs are beyond the scope of our ability. So I checked on Amazon how we could exchange it for a model that WORKS. Sadly, we missed the window for which Amazon is willing to replace the defective product by about 10 days. This is extremely frustrating -- almost as if it's built only to last during the warranty period, after which it irreparably breaks and there is no possibility of exchanging it for a model that works. We invested plenty of our own time and energy repairing it ourselves, so we believe we have been plenty generous in terms of holding up our end of the bargain. Now it is entirely useless and we can't return or exchange it. To put it another way: THIS PRODUCT IS A RIP-OFF. THE BUYER PAYS FOR A LEMON, AND IN RETURN, AMAZON SAYS ""TOO BAD, NOT OUR PROBLEM"" WHEN THE PRODUCT FAILS. THE BUYER IS OUT $$$ BUT AMAZON DOESN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELLING A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME AMAZON HAS RIPPED US OFF (THE OTHER WAS A PAIR OF WIRELESS EARBUDS PURCHASED DURING THE AMAZON PRIME DAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST THAT NEVER WORKED AT ALL -- AND NOT JUST US -- BUT SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT AMAZON ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN THE REVIEW SECTION MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WARN OTHER BUYERS OF THE SCAM) We have been good customers of Amazon from the beginning. However, the customer service is getting worse and worse every day. Now that Amazon and Bezos have more money than several small countries, not to mention the VAST number of consumers who have placed our trust in Amazon, purchased probably THOUSANDS of their products, and contributed greatly to the company's wealth (which, according to their hardworking employees, does NOT trickle down by investing in the employees who actually do the hard work). Compare this to a friend of mine who bought a Fitbit many months ago and decided she didn't like the design and Amazon didn't make her jump through hoops or pay shipping/return charges, they simply sent her a brand new one in a style she liked. That Fitbit cost about 5x more than the two products I've tried to return, but our customer service experiences are vastly different. Part of Amazon's game is to make returning a defective product such a hassle that the customer ultimately gives up and buys a new product, eating the financial loss. AMAZON. DOES. NOT. CARE. ABOUT. CUSTOMER. SERVICE. ANY. MORE. So what am I paying the ""Prime"" membership for? Being a Prime customer is getting more expensive, yet the ""services"" covered under #Prime are eroding to the point that there's virtually no benefit to being a Prime customer. Yes, I've talked more about Amazon's business practices than the lemon product I should be reviewing here. But how can I review a product that has spent more time not working than working? And if Amazon doesn't have my back when I'm spending tons of money on this site? Who has MY back? Amazon, I'd love a response.",1

192985,I purchased this just prior to Thanksgiving. My husband loved the fried turkey from Popeye's each year but they were getting more and more expensive and they didn't taste the same as the first year. They didn't even say fried anymore so I wanted to find something better. He was nervous with the oil of the turkey fryer's so I thought I'd try this. It was the easiest and best thing ever. The turkey tasted great! The skin wasn't real crispy like you would expect for a freshly fried bird but we don't eat the skin anyway. All I have to do was put the thawed bird (already seasoned and cleaned) in the cooker and turn it on. 2 and half hours later it was done. No more late nights or early mornings up cooking turkey all day. Clean up was easy too. It was well worth the price. I just used it to cook a turkey New Years day and it was delicious. I will be using this more often. It already paid for 2 turkeys from Popeye's.,5

179612,"My wife wanted a light, dark colored backpack for when we travel. This backpack was perfect. Also, you can put small travel locks to secure all items in their pouch and when your done you just fold it up into its' own bag. If you travel and want a lighter backpack to carry all your items, this is the one for you.",5

177028,"I see negative reviews that mention the air gap after shipment. From what I have read, this is extremely common during shipment as they would not be kept vertical. H-B's website has a video that shows you how to use a flame (I used a common lighter) to move the liquid into the upper bulb (be careful not to fill it as it could break the glass), at which point the air bubble easily disappeared for me. I used an oven mitt to hold the thermometer. It took all of 1 minute. If the gap was towards the bottom, then maybe dry ice is necessary? Mine was towards the top. I suppose the only way around this issue is to not order from Amazon, but in a brick and mortar store so you can inspect for gaps and where they probably kept it vertical at all times and probably removed any gap themselves before putting it on the shelves. Tho it does include a pretty case, the plastic container it was shipped in seems fine as a holder for the thermometer and that is what I am using. The folded instructions are still inside, but I see no need to remove them. I cut open just the top to be able to extract the thermometer whenever I want to use it.",5
172610,hold it well... good for tennis,5
174511,"Easy to install, fit great on my kitchen ! Like the way how it make! Only thing is I had too much plates and bowel, little too small ! But great quality!",5

Works as designed, company’s website provides detailed installation and device handler enhancement information for smartthings integration. If you are looking for great products and support, Inovelli should be your choice!",5
198114,"I really like this device. It does all the work for me and does it correctly the first time. Eggs peel easily as long as the cook uses the egg piercing pin that is part of the egg holder. After the egg is pierced, nothing leaks out. I make sure the pierced end is upright, on top, when cooking the eggs.",5
195935,Good quality and fast shipping.,5
185598,This ties into the bars to hold things when walking with the walker. Not a lot of room. Maybe a few papers or cell phone.,5

193753,Purchased for travel needs and have not had a chance to use yet other than to test out in my home for tablet and cell phone charging. Works find at home so will see what happens later when using in another country.Fantastic adapter!!! I loved the usb ports and the variety of different plug-ins for different countries. Great buy for traveling or even home as it can fit ports and a plug in all at once.,5
184942,"Well built RC car. It is big and fast, arrived one day after order, just right for the holiday fun! The size is bigger compared to other toys, it is really hobby category instead of toys. Full tires have their own suspension and work well when running surface bumping. It can jump from small slope giving a little accelerate. Control is easy and responded very well. Battery change/charge is very convenient which does not require any extra tool for the car. The remote handle does need small screwdriver to change battery (which is provided along with the car) Highly recommend. I believe it is the best that this amount of money can buy now.",5
178442,Used this on a 2006 Yamaha 90 2 stroke. The adapter fitting isn't exact but did not leak or hurt the threads of the existing plug. So much easier than squeezing the gear oil container into the lower unit.,5

193913,Great buy! Came very fast and hold so much! Perfect for a beginner that needs make up storage!,5
180979,Well made. Good heft to it.,5
181158,Works great! Simple to use. Since I had neglected my waterstones since I bought them it took a little time to flatten them. Just shows how important it is to maintain their flatness as I had good size divots in all my stones. Nice product,5
173845,Was worried about buying this one for compatibility issues. Many laptops get picky about their batteries with all the smart tech. This one went in easy and works great,5
168331,quick easy waterproof connection. When something is designed right you can't help but smile when you use it. That's exactly my reaction while up on a 12/12 pitch roof hooking up my panels with these cables!,5
165562,granddaughter loves the outfits.,5
188745,"great for bathroom items, also candles, etc.",5
163423,These crackers have saved my salads! I follow a strict AIP diet and these crackers have made it so much easier. They do need to be toasted before eating. I toast them in a toaster over but you can also do it on the stove top. I personally prefer them on the more toasted side. They do dissolve pretty quickly so I wouldn't recommend them in a soup. Very good! Highly recommend!,5
186042,"I am very happy with my baby food maker, is easy to clean and easy to use. It has been almost a year so far so good! The money invested is worthy.",5
182881,The color printer ink works perfectly. (I have not yet needed the black.) the three-pack price is excellent.,5

178997,Feels better than OEM.,5
195899,"I'm impressed by these clippers. They're well made and the rotating steel spring makes it easy to use and store. They are durable, meaning they can be run over by an F-150 without damage. They are very sharp. Not gonna tell you that story. For the price, you can't really beat it.",5
160484,The product came as ordered.,5
175222,We bought a used S5 on social media but once activated it wouldn't stay charged. We definitely couldn't get a refund so we prayed it just needed a battery. This battery worked better than expected.,5
199392,Received tons of compliments about this hair! no frizz!,5
161222,"This product works well. So well in fact that I thought it was going to suck the skin off of my face! I didn’t use steam to open my pores up and it still pulled junk out of my pores! I have always had blackheads pretty bad, and this tool helps tremendously!",5

198933,Best way to order replacement bags and never run out or have to search for the proper size in the store!,5
173273,I like this silicone oven mitts and pot holder. Silicone is waterproof and left no greasy stain on it. I think it is more durable than the fabric kinds,5
166372,These do a great job of eliminating light. Our friends had super light curtains and it was always an early wake up when we stayed over. We bought these for their house and now enjoy slightly longer sleep which is now interrupted by a toddler rather than bright morning sun,5
183750,Excellent Product and prompt delivery! Recommend.,5
184129,Great product! Love how my key is the pink color and my husband has the black. Makes it a little easier to know which key belongs to who,5
170346,MUCH better tasting than the other C4 flavors. Gives me an additional rush of energy at the gym. This stuff really had helped me with my lifting goals.,5

171858,"Good value, arrived quickly.",5
191797,Very pure and fresh. The price is amazing for the quality. I have purchased essential oils before for a much higher price and they didn't even smell like real peppermint. This is lovely in an essential oil humidifier. I also apply a drop or two on my neck when I am feeling overheated and stressed. Highly recommended.,5
183707,It is what it is it qorks awsome,5
162579,"For years, I've wished that DeOxit had a built-in straw - my wish has come true! This makes this product flawless. Use it on anything electrical that's being disagreeable - bad switches, corroded wiring points, scratchy volume pots. You name it!",5
168412,"Concept, not quite ground breaking, but near it. Acting, very believable. Characters, truly relate able. Just an overall wonderful experience with acceptable flaws and inconsistencies. The attention to detail is much appreciated. Visually pleasing, yet subtle enough to feel plausible. I enjoyed the ride and was very impressed by the obvious passion put forth. Please watch this film in an uninterrupted setting. It draws you in. 4.5 STARS!!!",5
168647,"My first dehydrator and it's working out really well.works great, easy to clean, great price。 The trays have been easy to clean so far, but I've only used it with apples, pears, and bananas -- might be a different story with other items. I keep it in the kitchen and run it while doing other stuff, watching TV, etc. Not terribly noisy, easy to ignore. I ignored everything in the booklet about pre-treatment -- I'm the only one eating my dried fruit, so I don't care if it's less attractive. I've also ignored the advice for long-term storage (letting the fruit ""sweat"" for a week to get rid of any remaining moisture), because I end up eating all of it within a couple of days!",5

198593,"This knife doesn't disappoint. Such a good value, I use this knife for just about any veggies and it stays super sharp.",5
188141,"I have another, similar holder, but I find that this one is better on the whole. Rather than a lever clamp, it has a screw sleeve that tightens it up against the vent. It is more secure as it doesn't wiggle loose. The only complaint I have is that the little arms that hold the phone on the bottom can pivot out of the way, but I've always seen when this has happened and just put them back in the correct position. I can only imagine that they designed these to swivel so that phones/devices with off-center ports could also be charged easily.",5

186513,"This is the best laptop stand I have ever owned- and I have owned plenty over the years. I wish I had had it on our last overseas trip. We travel a lot and I have never found the right size travel stand until now. It is well made, sturdy, compact, and also very lightweight. I work with my laptop on my lap on my couch with my feet up (I'm too short for my feet to touch the ground in a chair). My laptop gets so hot. I needed a stand that was light and airy. This one more than met my expectations.",5

186844,"I ordered this because I was experiencing achilles tendonitis. I am only using it on my right foot. When I put the brace on, I was immediately struck with how supportive it felt. It is supportive without being too tight. I've worn it for about 5 days now and the difference is amazing. I've been wearing it from the morning until I get home from work. The lump/swelling at the back of my heel has very noticeably gone down to where it is almost non-existent. I do feel an occasional twinge of pain if I try to walk to fast or stretch too much, but the constant pain I felt while walking is gone. I am so, so glad I purchased these socks. I would definitely recommend them to anyone with a similar malady.",5

The nicest thing about this product is it is made for people with sensitive skin and has NO awful perfumes.

I search for the older model agitator washers that you can actually fill up with water and completely control the wash cycle.

178545,Great diffuser. Though it's small it definitely can light up a room with the light it emits. Wish it came with oil(s).,5
182527,So far it has worked great. Super easy to install and glad I’m protecting my eyes while it is protecting my screen.,5
170247,"This case is awesome! It is sturdy and protective but relatively light. It comes with an attached protective film for the front which I figured I'd probably have to cut off (I noticed reviewers who do). However, it easily went on and does not interfere with the touchscreen at all! I even placed it over my tempered glass protector. It even lifted up and let me remove a cat hair (lol) and settled back down perfectly. There is only one little spot where there must have been a speck of dust but it is not noticeable when the screen is lit up. It works any which way - even at an angle (don't ask). I even use it as a handle to carry the tablet around although I didn't expect to. It took a while to get used to not having a case with a cover but, after all, that's how most phone cases are a d my screen is doubly protected (ymmv)! Pros: sturdy, protective, works at any angle, works as a carry handle, attractive. Cons: none",5
181232,"I love these pens. I have the colored ones too and I purchased these for when the black that came with those ran out. On that note, they do run out after a few months if you use them heavily. If you only use them every once in a while, they last much longer. Other than that, the ink is great, not much bleed, if any. They write beautifully and are great for bullets journalling. I would recommend them for paper that is a little thicker than normal, if you tried to use these in a notebook they would probably bleed badly. In all, great pens that I would definitely recommend!",5

I was a bit worried about using a safety razor at first, but once I started it was awesome!! I just held the razor gently to my skin and glided it across, leaving a smooth finish behind! I also love that it’s double sided so I can flip the head before having to rinse and repeat! Cleaning and changing blades is super easy and affordable!",5

170072,Looks just as cute as the picture.,5
170482,"This bracelet is a close replica of the original famous-name-brand, which is far, far more costly. It's beautiful! I ordered the plain stainless, and when I received it I placed an order for another in rose. Mine did not come with a red box, but I don't care about that. It is engraved inside. The screws that fasten the bracelet work well, and I was able to put it on myself with no trouble. The only thing I worried about was which size to order. My wrists measure about 6 1/2"" around, however I personally prefer bangle style bracelets to be a bit looser than link style bracelets, so I ordered the 7"" bracelet and it fits exactly how I like it, just a little room to spare and move around my wrist a bit. The places on the inside of the bracelet where the screws are do not bother me at all. I wear it next to my steel watch and it looks fabulous! Since receiving it, I have slept and showered in it and have had no issues whatsoever. I will probably order the yellow one next, just because I love choice and the price is reasonable.",5

193038,great colors good build quality and bokeh. flaring very well controlled. good glass gives film like quality. if you wanna slow down and be patient with your photography this is a no brainer. 1 caveat. the focus is good but you have to be dead on as it doesn't give more much leeway. you have to be very precise. otherwise a great lens for the money.,5

I checked out the ones advertised on TV... for a small fortune and then found this type, which I didn't' even know existed! I began reading reviews on Amazon and chose this one. It was a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it! No more stress over opening a bottle of wine! He has fun and it is so fast! It 's fun to watch, as well! Cool blue light.
