84660,"I‚Äôm giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn‚Äôt realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn‚Äôt. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don‚Äôt know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.",3

106473,"I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus.

The gate is purposely agape to adjust to the tightening of the tension screws. You tighten up until the door meets the latch. Right now, I have it fit sort of kitty-corner between the two walls which is not ideal as I can't keep it at the proper tension.

100033,"I have a turtle beach headset for my xbox one, so it was a no brainer to get one for my recently purchased PS4. However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else.

Seriously there really wasn‚Äôt anything I didn‚Äôt like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that‚Äôs honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don‚Äôt read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets. It was a quick read for me, but definitely not a reread.",3

I'm used to high-waisted swimsuits, so I keep wanting to pull these higher. The mesh lining is poor quality and oddly attached only on the front of the shorts. Worst of all, the outline of your bits 'n pieces are visible through the shorts! I cannot emphasize this enough. It's cameltoe city with these!

111629,The case adds character and protection to my Switch and I love the whole design except the case for the joy-cons. The small pieces to hold the joy-con cases together are small and fragile. They broke off after a couple of months when I was trying to put it back on. I can no longer use the cases for joy-cons but still kept the case for the console on. Overall I like this case.,3

I cringed everytime my neighbor shot his 40 cal. Even my 9mm was a tad louder than it should have been. Now I need to buy ""indoor"" protection. Also found their manual confusing. It comes in 27 languages, and they give you this confusing image. (See my uploaded picture.)",3

106562,"Pros: not a shiny thin party store wig, held up to heat. Cons: wefts are layered in an odd fashion - making it hard to section off areas to cut properly, this same issue makes it difficult to maneuver it to cover your actual hair, the hair on the clips aren't long enough to cover the stretch cord underneath, the wig cap is very tall/long which makes the fit even more awkward. Additional details: the pigtails are not nearly as full as in the image. The color of the hair is far more saturated. The wig hairs are thin and silky, making them stick up often during brushing. I don't recommend purchasing this wig if you plan to style it in any way. It's a wig, it's what I have so I have to make do, but it's altogether a hassle to wear. The odd wig cap means lots of readjusting.",3
88221,Decent case. Stand piece is super cheap and isnt held in well.,3

102088,I wasn't super impressed with these strips. it seemed the edges would lift or only a small portion of the strip would show color. There's nothing like peeing on a strip and getting dark red results. Never got that from these strips - did a side by side comparison with a different brand. Just wasn't super impressed.,3

Everything is plastic and does not fit at the same level on the windshield as the original. The OEM blades I replaced have multiple metal supports and springs and are much more substantial.

81830,Great packaging; unlike any I have seen for tempered glass. Too many bubbles because cut too big. Had to remove case because protector was literally edge-to-edge and still not sit right. I guess I got that one bad one in the batch üòï.,3
110728,Doesn't keep water out. Did not come with ear or nose plugs as advertised.,3
102635,My dog has noooo interest in this toy. It smells horrible of rubber. After cleaning it with water and airing it out for 3days it still smells to my nose. I tried adding a yummy cheese to entice my dog to play tug with me but nothing. If your dog is a heavy chewer than he might love this. For medium chewing dogs like mine even with me trying to turn it into a great game he has no interest. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the rubber smell as he will play with his Kong‚Äôs just fine.,3

104874,"Use caution when buying this piece. Despite the mix reviews I decided to order this for my 29 gallon freshwater tank I‚Äôve been working on. I really liked how the castle looked with the small cave and the dementions were perfect for what I needed (about the size of a soda can). After reading some of the negetive reviews before ordering I decided when I received the castle I would soak it in water for a few days to see what would happen. Guys it‚Äôs been soaking in a clean cup for 4 days and already there is a chemical smell coming from the water. I don‚Äôt doubt the resin used to mold this is safe. However, this paint they are using on the castle is definitely dissolving into the water. Not only that I don‚Äôt think the paint is eco safe either, it smells....wrong. I think I‚Äôm going to continue soaking this for up to a week alternating between sanitizer and clean water. After that I might coat the castle with some acrylic gloss protective spray paint a few times to hopefully seal it off before placing it in my tank. Besides the failure with the paint I love how this thing looks. If you do buy be aware you will have to do something about the paint, you don‚Äôt want this junk in your tank with your pets.",3
105456,They are ok.. not my favorite,3
107870,"It's definitely works and makes my small pieces of ice to crunch on I love it! I'm pretty concerned about the after taste, it leaves the ice tasting like the plastic which I can't imagine that being healthy.

65426,Well it‚Äôs looks and feels okay but it most certainly does not have 4 pockets that‚Äôs a lie it has 3 so that‚Äôs pretty messed up to say it has 4 when it‚Äôs only 3 the fabric is super stiff hopefully after washing it will be better,2

I‚Äôm almost 4 weeks in and it‚Äôs not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I‚Äôm off my feet because I don‚Äôt wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you‚Äôre not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times.

If the paint wasn‚Äôt chipped, I‚Äôd give it 5 stars. *Install note: It is possible to remove the stock knob without destroying it. Just pop the lower chrome collar loose with a trim removal tool. Once that is free, the knob slides right off. (Same thing for the 4 Wheel transfer knob).",2

I sat on it then fell right off. I really think I am missing something. My 12-year old had trouble staying on it as well. We left it next to the tent that night and must have gotten rain because in the morning the thing had water in it...actually inside the liner.

I believe that the intent is for the reader to join the author's online forum to compare and discuss solutions there (I hope the author will clarify, if I am wrong about that).",2
57992,Very inconsistent in connection.,2
40287,"Would have liked directions. No clue how to attach loose strap and whether to use, when, and how.",2
78583,"I hate to write a product review because the balls themselves were fine. The are smaller than the average ball pit balls( like the other people said ) but are as listed. My issue is my product did not arrive in time. After an hour on the phone with Amazon I was instructed to order another set, because they could not guarantee delivery of the late ones. I was told if the other balls arrived I could keep them and be refunded the money for my inconvenience. I have not been refunded my money. So my review is for service not the quality of the product itself.",2
79982,After installing this my washing machine worked just fine. After 2 months it quit working again. It could be my machine but since it worked fine for a couple months I have to assume that it was the drain pump.,2
75374,Poor quality. Did not bend around nostrils very well,2
73440,Smelled really bad. Ended up returning,2
65141,"They didn't last long. They stretched out, lost their shape, and lost any strength in their structure. They were basically wonderful socks that had to be hand-washed. They turned out to be a great disappointment, because they were warm and felt so good when I got them.",2
50027,I bought the double pack and only 1 cartridge worked. My canon printer won't recognize the second cartridge.,2
69732,"The speakers I purchased for my system are somewhat cool sounding in the mids so I bought this pre-amp to warm them up and give them a more full sound. Taking this little guy out of the box it felt very well built and sturdy considering how small it was. I LOVE the feel of turning the nobs, it gives you a very satisfying click click click as you adjust them. The sound quality out of this didn't significantly change the sound but it's possible I needed to let this thing burn in a little. The treble and bass adjustments worked well and provided a noticeable difference in sound from min to max. Sitting next to my class D amplifier with the cool blue lights on and the gold finish on the nobs looked very cool. Unfortunately when I plugged these in line between my source and my amp and powered it on it gave the speakers a large pulse which made sort of a BOOM sound. When I turned the preamp on and off I kept getting the boom sound which made me feel like it could be sending too large of a signal into my speakers, potentially damaging them. Since I spent good money for high quality speakers I didn't want to run the risk of damaging them with a cheap little pre-amp so I will not be using it anymore.",2
72835,The smaller bits snapped as soon as the started to cut in. From about 1/8 and up worked fine but I had to go to Lowes and buy some cheap standard right hand bits to start with.,2
61204,Was missing the crayons,2
43700,"My chickens love this, but packaging failed. Seeds all over the inside of the shipping box.",2
63792,I have ordered size 11 for years. This is the only pair that was way to small. I guess it's back to shopping for shoes the old way.,2
64894,These are more like regular napkins the the normal guest towels that I normally have bought in the past. Can't wait for these to run out. They are rough and not soft.,2
75000,"Purchased several boxes of these to replace our townhouse rental bulbs throughout. After spending countless hours reading through hundreds of reviews and scouring Amazon and the net for good quality and high lumens bulbS, I decide on these. As LED‚Äôs are not inexpensive when first replacing, and you only experience money savings with usage down the road, I was disappointed to find 1 of the bulbs did not work immediately out of package. Would have given 5 stars, if this were not the case, as they are bright and efficient, and to find LED‚Äôs in this shape with this many lumens is difficult. Disappointing.",2
69811,"The dress is perfect size when worn without closing the fleece for leg and hands. Moreover although the cloth quality is good, it was dirty. Looks like it is a used product.",2
59690,I bought this hoping to get my dog to stop pulling but it doesn't stop her. Maybe works on dogs with lower pain tolerance.,2
44218,"This came in a small, flat white package - paper thin quality. I snipped the top of the package open with scissors and low and behold I unknowingly snipped the top of the belt off, rendering it useless. I tried taping it back together but iit can‚Äôt be really taped back, because then it bends when wrapped around the finger. I can‚Äôt comment on the effectiveness of the belt but the wrapping? A product so small, flat and light should be seen in a bag that‚Äôs transparent - so mistakes like this could be avoided.",2
75221,"The fan looks good and works well. However it didn't come with the bulbs. I bought the bulbs separately from Amazon and when I tried to screw it in, the bulb holder thread broke off. Now one of the lights don't work.",2
53573,"Only dislike because the light did not work, and had to send back. The slides went in and ejected great, however. I was greatly disappointed, since this was the 2nd slide viewer I had to send back for the same reason.",2
45222,"The header says this is 100% feather and down, but the description says down and ‚Äúdown-like material. This down-like material does not form like feather/down does. The non-feather material stays fluffy and doesn‚Äôt allow you to customize the pillow to your sleeping needs. We‚Äôve had our pillows since April 2019, and I constantly have neck pain.",2
50131,I used it and it really didn't work for me. Maybe I will use it again on another polish thats better.,2
72895,There is enough of that in real life. Do we really need it in a cozy mystery? That whole episode about the two men saying she was too pretty and could not be taken seriously was extremely unnecessary.,2
42259,These were great for 3 months then they all stopped working at the same time.,2
40661,There is a center internal divider that limits how you place your BroadHeads.,2
44074,Do not like this shirt. Looks like a box shirt.,2
53876,"The cable had some problems with the resolution. The company sent me replacement, but the new one has this issue aswell. I think this cable is faulty because it doesn't correctly recognize my LG 4K display. It displays it in wrong resolution and it shows that the display supports maximum 30 hertz while it is 60. I recommend buying a different brand to connect MacBook Pro to 4K monitors",2
53310,The screws broke when I replaced the battery.,2
78482,I ordered an 2xl and it was not true to size,2
52419,"This is rather poor quality; the outer shell that 'sits' on the post is really thin crappy metal that cracked with the slightest tension from the screws. In addition, the glass panels fit rather loosely and do not sit securely in their 'slots'. I would definitely not recommend this item.",2
66109,"The lumbar support piece broke off after a few months of use, for the price I would have expected this chair to last a lot longer",2
75452,"I rarely write a review but I wanted it known that the product above has straps that are at this point stretched out and broke. I tend to carry purses for longer than a few months and expect them to be durable and last. I ordered at the end of May 2018 and it was stretched by July and broken now in August 2018. Very disappointing as I loved the size, look, and feel of the purse.",2
69970,"Worked well for about a day. Application was easy & flawless. After a day or two it starts to lift off the screen, making it hard to press the icons you need to. It came in a 2 pack. Tried both, had same experience.",2
60054,"These are easy to assemble, fairly durable (particularly for the price), and just the function and profile I like. I've had several. One of these last two arrived damaged, with a significant dent in the base, although the box was undamaged and everything appeared properly packed. I have no means to pursue amends except to return the lot, and leave this review.",2
71049,"ModMic is decent quality, but my main annoyance that I was hoping wouldn't be a big deal was the two cords and the magnetic attachment. The magnet connection is weak, and the mic gets knocked loose constantly. I'm also a bit let down there is almost no actual movement for the mic in terms of the length of it, its hard to get it positioned in the right spot angled towards your mouth while also being comfortably out of your vision and out of mind. Any sort of adjusting, of course, knocks it out of the magnet connection and leaves it frustrating. It sounds good, the idea is good, but functionally there are some annoyances that makes me opt for my older headset that I was hoping to retire.",2
46452,"It's a typical Master Lock. Thing that frustrates me though is they advertise a blue one and like others I see on here they sent a PINK one... Seriously? I HATE the color pink.... I think if they have different colors, people should be able to CHOOSE the color they get... Yeah, this is what caused the 2 star rating.",2
48569,Cheaply made. One zipper broke immediately.,2
55208,Bought it as a spare for my switch but it doesn't work because of a recent update. Not really the chords fault but I bought it because it was advertised as a possible spare for the switch.,2
63663,"I bought this for my baby shower and I didn‚Äôt even get to put it up. When it arrived, the package was ripped, so the straw to blow it up was missing. We tried to improvise and use another straw but the opening seems to be fused together, and I believed it ripped after multiple attempts. I would pass on this one.",2
77161,"The light seems nice except that the 2,400 lumen description is completely bogus. Not even close. It's no brighter than a 400 lumen headlamp. Otherwise, it would be a great product only if described correctly.",2
58872,Very light compared to what the chart shows. Doesn't go on easily.,2
48103,After the first warm day the stickiness was lost. Also a bit bulky looking. Cool concept and when it worked it was nice.,2
57671,"The tape is fine, although the rolls are smaller than I expected. However, it took a month to arrive. I did not like that when I placed my order it was listed as Prime and then took so long to arrive. Check the seller before you buy.",2
70969,They dont fit properly I try both already it seem too small for this phone,2
53926,"Used one time, went to use again and the locking mechanism is broken so I can't open them anymore.",2
57617,"I‚Äôve had these sheets for just over a year now. Over the past few months they‚Äôve started to tear in small places, which turn into huge holes. I‚Äôll never purchase these again, as they are not durable at all. Very disappointing.",2
70025,Part is ok I just got sent the large wheels which won't work on my dishwasher. Make sure you order the right ones.,2
42277,"these are okay, just be advised really short, and may rise up in between your legs.",2
47731,"We had a Crate & Barrel heavy duty stainless canister for our coffee for the last 12 or so years & the (plastic, but heavy duty) latch finally gave up. So we bought this as replacement - decent reviews on AMZ. THE GOOD: It‚Äôs at least a good size to hold a whole 16 oz. bag of ground coffee. (Our last one only held ~14 oz). THE BAD: Super thin stainless steel - I have yet to drop or bang against counter accidentally, but if/when that happens, it‚Äôs gonna dent easily. THE UGLY: Rubber gasket is already falling off regularly. Gonna add a drop of clear silicone to hold in place. The latch is crap. It‚Äôs hard to get the ‚Äúhook‚Äù to align on the cruddy ‚Äúcatch‚Äù part & feels like it‚Äôs gonna break off in my hand every day. Just cheap-o. Caveat emptor!",2
61738,Not a good fit. I wear a size 12 US. They do not stay up. Way to small. Would not recommend,2
53099,"The texture and the overall product didn‚Äôt live up to reviews. Didn‚Äôt get rid of bruise any faster. Figure I can use on bottom of feet,now.",2
61757,Didn't like the flavor,2
62483,Not a daily wig!!! Way to thick and heavy. It was great for a laugh at least. Thank God I didn't spend much on it.,2
53746,The products worked great until one of the bags ripped open on a seam. They will be returned shortly and going with a different brand. Disappointing because i have ran this type before with no issues. I cant have questionable product on the vehicle these are going on this time however.,2
65737,"So I've used this thing about 6 times to hang pictures now, and 5 out of those 6 times I have had to re-hang my picture. I am doing all of the things it tells me to do and when I put the points against the wall I make sure the bubble is right smack in the middle of the level before pressing into the drywall- but 5 out of 6 times it has gone wonky. To be fair- it might be because the floor isn't level. But it could also be because the mechanics of the product aren't quite lined up, so read the other reviews before you decide.",2
72479,"I like the stand but the rubber broke only after a few months use :( Since there is no warranty, can the seller send me the rubber replacement ???",2
70583,"This harness is great when it comes to the looks and the velcro. It looks simple yet better looking than a regular harness. The velcro makes it very easy to get it off and on the dog and they usually don't seem to care about it when I put it on which is great. However, the harnesses I got didn't really last for me. On one of the harnesses I ordered, the buckle part snapped off with a little bit of rough play. As for the other harness, I put my dog on the leash and he started to run just a little, but when the leash tugged on the metal ring it was attached to, the fabric holding that piece just ripped apart and detached from the harness. Overall a good looking product and I still like how easy it is to put on my dogs, but probably not the best choice for dogs that are just a little rambunctious as it probably won't last.",2
53220,Didn‚Äôt give my lashes the lift I thought it would!,2
49685,"I‚Äôm reviewing based on the fact that I have received the wrong item. I cannot speak to the quality of the matt itself since it is not the item I received. I was very excited to try this matt out and ordered it twice hoping to get a different outcome. Each time I received a red matt with round circles missing the ear loops. The first time I ordered pink, the second time I ordered blue. I‚Äôm hoping that amazon and the seller can get this problem resolved since I‚Äôm still interested in getting the product that was listed and would look forward to trying it out.",2
62201,"The coffee is delicious, but the spigot drips constantly and makes a terrible mess. I wish it didnt have a spigot at all.",2
49081,The coating has nicks and scratches. I didn't have enough free time to send it back.,2
55102,Cheap quality. Gauge clip fell apart within a week of use.,2
55853,I like these dishes except it did not take long before at least one of the sides not to stay clamped shut on the lid. I don't like the fact that the rubber seals are removable because those types seem hard to shut (which these lids are) and they get lost. The dish itself are fine I am just having problems with the lids.,2
70357,More cheaply made than I expected from the picture.,2
71450,Hate this. Looks cheap. Regret buying this.,2
158154,Really cute mug. I would have given 5 stars if it were a bit bigger.,4
134858,"Fairly thick material, so the poncho should be good for multiple uses. It's VERY large, so if you're small in size don't expect it to be fashionable. I'm 5'3"" and it covers me from head to calf. Definitely gets the job done in keeping you covered.",4
132467,Super cute and very sturdy set. Looks great on my desk.,4
142133,Nice looks like picture,4
156518,Seems to be working for my older dog. The vet recommended this brand.,4
130690,"Love these. Bought a total of 4 now. Over time they seem not to stand up like they did brand new, but still like them. Easy to carry up and down stairs, durable, and fit more than a full load of laundry.",4
132176,"Its perfect for my purpose, its lite weight is perfect, and so soft and warm. I stopped using an electric blanket because this one is so much more comfortable.",4
129625,Some of the designs are hard to recognize.,4
129464,"Very nice quality and incredibly soft. However, they are very thin so you need to fold them in order to wipe more easily, or you need to completely soak them in makeup removing product. It's fine, unless your product is a bit expensive and you only want to use a little, like me.",4
142387,"Since I have just received this product, I haven't had time to know for sure how it will benefit me. So far, so good.",4
142234,"Love them, but the volume is low. I can't hear them without speaker phone.",4
139136,"Ordered 18 of these lights to replace aging halogen outdoor landscape lights. All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.",4
150191,Easy to install and worked to pump fluid to my windshield.,4
128744,"A very solid watch band. A little heavy, and a little hard to adjust the sizing, but a good band.",4
129878,4/5 from a satisfied customer. I saw a similar product advertised on Facebook and searched for it on Amazon. This was the same product I saw and cheaper. It performs as its supposed to. Unfortunately the size of the glove is too big for my hand.,4
145012,"Great case overall, it's very hard and protects the phone very well. Only thing I dislike a little is the buttons are a bit hard to press, but you get used to over time.",4
134552,Warm and dry. Good fit around ankle for support.,4
146321,They are sticky but probably because of the heat -- they were in the mail box and we had high temps in AR,4
137859,Helpful on my trip to the UK. The computer chargeing ports are a nice extra,4
143390,Bought these to cycle through a newly bought shotgun. Did not jam.,4
145114,It was ok needs jewellery to make it look great.,4
153367,"This is my second one from Oh La La Cheri because it fits perfectly, is actually open crotch in the right spot, is comfortable and made well enough to last a while. My fianc√© loves it.",4
146279,"They‚Äôre great, durable and fit well. I do recommend setting them outdoors to air out for a few days until you put them in your car.",4
138794,"These are plain pitted prunes, on the small side and a little dry, with excellent flavor. You may need more of them than usual to create a laxative effect. But they are easy to eat straight from the package and absolutely fine with oatmeal or yogurt in the morning. I ordered them when my local grocery was out of prunes for some reason and was glad to be able to get these from Amazon.",4
123495,"Writes smoothly and cleanly. Does not dry up and clog between uses. I use it for drawing. I have the extra fine and just ordered the medium. It arrived with the barrel snapped in three pieces. It was shipped in a flexible bubble envelope which probably got bent during shipping. This item is not returnable, but when I contacted Amazon, I did receive a refund. So I am going to order it again and hope it arrives undamaged.",4
126838,Good screen for the money - looks good. Just hate that it uses most of the GPIO pins which keep them from being used for other things. Otherwise pretty nice.,4
121244,"Tree is beautiful and lights are the perfect brightness. Sadly, the first windy day the tree broke off of the base. Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base. I solved the problem by creating a new base using 18"" long 1/2"" black iron pipe to push inside the tree's metal tube, then attached that to a 1/2"" black iron pipe flange. This flange was then welded to 4 legs of 2"" angle iron, each 15"" long. The base is then held down with 2 sandbags.",4
141312,"Very nice keepsake box, Purchased for a gift.",4
122529,"I was stunned by this book held my interest throughout. The relationship between the two lead female characters was an unexpected, but welcome development. Although I received the book from instant freebies, I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.",4
147696,best buy is at Costco or Smith&Final,4
129028,I found it easy to set up but it is a little tricky getting it to lock in place so you can use it. I haven't placed it in the dishwasher so I can't say that it's dishwasher safe. It easier to use a bottle brush and clean it with soap and water. I love having two bottles. Great for the price.,4
159377,The antelope color is not the same as I expected it to be. Looks different online.,4
142051,"looks better in person than online. somewhat hard to tighten the band by yourself, also can be uncomfortable if you tighten too much since it is not a flexible band.",4
152038,Great quality for a reasonable price. I used this at a baby shower I hosted and everyone was impressed! SO pretty!!,4
120595,"I got these because i saw them featured (not this particular brand) on a talk show. They are nice, and will keep out the sun from damaging your eyes and causing wrinkles....very cool!",4
141969,So soft. Just watch the stitching,4
155349,Is OK but runs small,4
140993,"I ordered a size up because my butt is larger than the rest of me, and like every other pair of jeans/shorts I buy, the waist is too big. You can see my underwear in these if I don‚Äôt have something underneath. They are good quality though.",4
140570,I just wish it would save the names.,4
121773,"Great knife for the money. As other reviews have noted, this is a bulky knife. Not something you‚Äôd want to carry in your pocket everyday. Blade is nice and solid/thick, and sharp, but the action is not as smooth or lightening fast as I was hoping it would be. Overall, solid everyday work knife for sure!",4
152848,They are comfortable except hard to get used to with the controls ..... buttons in odd places,4
134683,"Overall good product, except for handset screen could be brighter to read",4
149023,I like the colors and the staying power of these glosses. A good value for my money. They are a bit sticky so only 4 stars.,4
141647,This a great case for the price. It looks great while also providing the protection that I need for my iPhone.,4
126670,Excellent product - feels great and very therapeutic. My massage therapist recommended this for reflexology.,4
147138,"Let me first say that this mouse was the perfect shape, weight, and in my opinion the ideal mouse for any FPS. It just isn't compatible with the microsoft surfacebook 2. It freezes and jumps around every so often.",4
138412,It was the perfect gift for a family member who enjoys handheld poker electronic games. My reason for 4 stars is that it has a small screen.,4
129241,Only complaint is that it's battery operated only for the sound machine and vibration. Both were much needed for a newborn. Very disappointed that it didn't come with a plug option. Otherwise it looks great and great quality.,4
155995,Cute and a great piece to wear for any costume,4
146735,I like these bands! Colors are bright and vibrant. My only gripe is the two holders for the excess band slide too easy.,4
155058,"Pretty easy to assemble. The quality is decent I just wish it was taller to watch movie while sitting in chairs. The screen is pretty short. Originally I put it up for movie and it fell back cause of strong winds, good thing it came with stakes and rope to stake it down for stability.",4
155395,Great info from a history buff,4
149807,"This is a great purchase for the price. Works great, speed is great and i appreciate that it comes with the extra blade replacement pieces. My only complaint is that it does not come with a plug for the USB cord, thought that was odd. But considering the savings, compared to $15 for most electric sharpeners and the fact that most items we have use USB cords, we are fully stocked. That was the only reason for 4 out of 5 stars",4
157289,"I was skeptical about ordering this, but thought anything had to be better than what we had. We got it out of the box and into the camper. We have not slept on it yet. But we have laid on it for couple minutes and so far I am super impressed. I am debating on replacing our bunk beds as well. Well worth the money. Only reason I‚Äôm rating it 4 stars is because we have not slept a night on it yet.",4
128657,Cute his and her keychains. Very sturdy,4
134853,"They are pretty cool, but don‚Äôt drop them. Very easy to dent the metal ring.",4
142262,The Bottoms Did Not Fit My height,4
130936,We like that it‚Äôs insulated and we like that it‚Äôs unbreakable. It Is hard to press sometimes though. I don‚Äôt know if this is because the grind we are using is too fine? It is aesthetically pleasing. Overall we are very happy thank you.,4
140064,These were perfect size to go inside the ACE bandage I was wearing. The sleeve kept it from direct skin contact but allowed the cold through. These were somewhat difficult to activate but this prevented accidentally breaking the inner bubble.,4
157959,"I loved the variety of colors and craftsmanship of each bow. Beautifully made. The clips, however, will not clamp onto the hair causing the bows to fall off of the hair.",4
141982,"Be careful when tightening the fittings, especially the fittings in the Tankless heater, ensure you use a wrench to hold the fitting there not to twist off or damage the copper fitting piping inside the heater. And use the right size wrench and not pliers or channel locks, because you can damage or round off the the edges of fittings. Phasing the fittings is easy to get the alignment you need.",4
137110,"Nice headphones for the price. I love the rich rose gold color that matches my iPhone and accessories. The sound is really good and everyone can hear me clear as well. The music clarity is good and has a nice volume level. The only thing is the distance of the headset to the phone is a little short for good reception. It even announces the caller by name or number. Overall, I like this product.",4
143244,The story is gripping and it really draws you in. My only complaint is the author seemed to bounce around a bit and didn‚Äôt explain who was whom very well.,4
142791,"I was hesitant on these, my wife bought them. I installed them and am very pleased with the look and function.",4

157925,"Easy to assemble and sturdy, light enough to pick up and move, and the speakers sound great. However, this chair is far from comfortable. you sink into the chair for lack of cushion, and you can feel the front board in the chair on the back of your legs. Also, the curve at the lumbar portion of the chair arcs your back and causes pain after a short time. Recommend extra padding/lumbar support if you get this chair.",4
136872,Too small for my dog,4

147163,Is not what I expected. Memory foam too thin.looks nice.,4
159189,"No assembly was nice. Made in America üëçüèª Arrived in open box, one bent stake which I managed to straighten, no packing slip (probably due to completely open box) Perfect addition to the garden. Would purchase again.",4

149499,"So I thought I would be getting some type of a ""minty orange"" lifesaver....(I wonder why? Look at the name of them!!!) WHen I tried my first one....Nope...NO ""mint""! It's more of a bright orange flavor....Don't get me wrong...it's good, and a nice ""bright"" flavor over ""Mint""....but the description is a little misleading. (Wow....ask my 22 year old self if I would be reviewing LIFESAVERS later in life, and I would have finished my beer, then laughed at you!) I think these are good!

141513,"Dock is solid, clean, cheap, and easy to install. However, after looking around I would consider buying a different shell that is compact enough to fit in a travel case (This one is slightly too thick to fit in mine), or a larger one with more features. For example, I would have liked to use the spring-loaded cradle and the power LED from the original dock. When I get a second dock I will be looking for a shell that includes these features. However, I have no problems with this one and I use it all the time on my TV. When I take the switch to someone else's house I put the ac adapter and the dock with the switch in a larger bag.",4

I read other reviews that mentioned how thin they were but didn‚Äôt think it would bother me so I ordered them anyway. Well, I‚Äôm not sure I would have ordered them if someone had mentioned that they are paper thin. No joke they might be thinner than paper!

144645,"I bought the kitchen shears for preparing chicken for Asian dishes. We enjoy free range chicken on the bones so I needed to have shears that can cut through breast bones. These shears have comfortable handles and is very sharp. The shears can also be used to open bottles and can scale fish. I like the fact that the shears can come apart which makes it easy to clean them. The shears come with a magnetic sleeve to hang them on the fridge, but mine was warped so it did not stick on the fridge.",4

153723,"This tent is perfect for my wife and I. Set up is crazy easy and our tent was up in seconds compared to our friends who have traditional tents. It is spacious and left plenty of room even after our queen size mattress was in it. The only downside is that if you want any privacy you have to have the fly on because the whole top of the tent is mesh. If your not in some shade, with the fly on its get pretty warm pretty quick when the sun is shining since there aren‚Äôt really windows to unroll and let a breeze through. Usually you camp under some trees however so this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem too often. Overall we love this tent! The blue color is a plus too because it really stands out and looks beautiful!",4

136135,"The kids are great. I bought them with the stands to start sprouting with jars. They worked fine. Honestly though, I would have liked something simple like a cheap plastic jar tipper...but thought, at the time that more fancy was better. Not necessarily true. You dont need to be able to tip jars at unlimited angles...just far enough to get the water out without clogging the holes.",4
136303,I love the idea of these bags and I use them to keep food fresh in the freezer. My one complaint is that it can be hard to get them open and closed.,4
123350,So good for hanging tools on. Clip could be slightly tighter to prevent it lifting up when removing tools.,4
120678,the product is definitely versatile and good idea to keep around for any family accident. keeping ours.,4

127161,Great fitting earpiece that was really easy to mold. Would have been 5 starts if they had provided a second adaptor so you could have both a right and a left earpiece in at the same time. Price is a bit expensive for only one fully functional earpiece.,4

152118,"Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.",4
124030,Really nice looking in person. Keeps everything at temp.,4
121615,Not bad. Beans are better than grounds if you have the tool to grind it.,4

I bought 2 of them: wine red one for me and black one for my mom. Too bad they don‚Äôt offer different sizes in this band. I was very disappointed at first because I love how slim these bands are! I was going to return them but then I decided to buy a tool to make holes instead and I did, spent only $7 on it and it worked perfect and we are both very pleased with our bands! We made 2 MORE holes on each band!!! (With the same distance between holes as original holes). These smart watches are meant to be kind of tight on your wrist, well not tight, but touching the skin all around, so it can feel the heartbeat, track your exercise, track your sleep at night, etc, so having them even a little loose is useless to me.",4

130641,works ok but are smaller than i thought they should be i guess that is why they don't sat they are for tractors,4
148864,I ordered this product a size larger than I normally wear and it was snug. 2 sizes larger would probably have fit perfectly. The fabric is soft and breathable. These are easily dressed up for work or to be made more casual.. very versatile,4
133785,Works great around your nails for clean up. If you use it as a base to keep your nails from being damaged it takes forever to dry.,4

131209,"4.5 Stars for Lie With Me I love the Stonewall Investigation series and have from the very beginning. I was so glad that author Max Walker didn't stop the series but opened up more offices across the nation and spending time in Miami with the boys. Loved Oliver and Beckham together. I have to say I was shocked at the twist at the end, for the life of me never expected it. That's what I enjoy about reading a Max Walker book, the suspense, mystery and the romance. This is the trifecta for a good read!",4
133046,"I ordered a size 8 and it fitted true to size. The shoe is cute and very light. The rubber soles are nice for walking around the office. It has minimal cushion support, I suggest getting an insert if you plan on being on your feet for a couple hours.",4
140006,"I love the shoes - they are super comfortable. I ordered a size 8 Wide (which I sometimes wear along with size 8) because they didn‚Äôt have size 8 and it is a little too big, but I‚Äôm going to keep them since I already wore them.",4

I am so disappointed because it truly is a beautiful piece of jewelry and so versatile! I may consider trying it again and hoping the second one holds up a little better.",4
124333,"This is a stunning table and perfect for spring and summer patio furniture. Everything folds to store in the garage during the winter. The quality is fairly decent, especially for the price! I would not expect very large people to be comfortable in these chairs, though. The arms do not fold up and the chairs are built for small/ average weight people. Giving it 4 stars because it was a total pain in the rear to put together, and the instructions were awful (no words, and minimal photos). If you aren't good at assembling furniture then do not buy this table set.",4
131206,Do not take the advice of other customers and order a size larger. Order your regular American size...,4
136778,The vibration is a bit loud but I like the spontaneous play at home or in public. The vibration speeds are average. Overall decent by if u r just looking for a little tease,4
129510,"This is a very short movie, a kind of ""Who dunnit?"" thriller where women with disabilities are being murdered by a psychotic killer whose identity is revealed at the end. Black and white photography and acting are very good. It's a low budget production and the story takes place inside a house. There are almost no exterior shots, if any. Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film. Blu ray transfer is decent considering the other black and white films from that era. Pros: Good thriller. Cons: Short movie (it feels like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Hour)",4
148326,"Not quite like frying in oil but without the mess and expense of oil. Certainly healthier. But be prepared to adjust your recipes and taste, and you will be thrilled with results.

141499,Enjoyed the detectives. Plot less compelling. Ready for 2nd of the series,4
121687,I now own these in 4 different colors. I gave it 4 stars because on one of the shirts the stitching was a little loose but over all a good buy. They are long enough to wear with leggings and cover your back end. The colors are just like pics.,4
130065,"They are a bit loose. The toe kept slipping off when she kicked around, so I'll have to make some alterations. Other than that, very nice colors.",4
149337,"Much larger than I expected, and well-constructed. The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles. It really helps with our portable mini washer which requires constant draining, spinning and refilling to wash and rinse clothes. It's easy to forget which stage the laundry is at, and the indicator saves us guessing.",4
126483,"Seems like it will last a while, as long as it is used for the purpose to which it was designed.",4
156911,Helped play in the steering wheel slightly. Adjusting the gears on the gear box worked much better to reduce play. Also bad wheel bearings can cause excessive play in the steering wheel. I broke off a bolt inside the frame where the sway bar attached and had to weld a rivet nut to the frame. Just be aware when installing.,4
156754,The fitting was not comfortable and the mask was heavy.,4
124893,"Stronger than I thought so I have adapted the dosage for my needs. You will have to test it for yourself. To much puts me to sleep. I use it a lot at bedtime.

123540,It is soothing and may help retard the onset of cataracts. If that could be proven I would give it ten stars.,4
142849,I like how it helps stand-up. I don't like how to put them on. They don't really help with the knee problem i have. I've only worn them once and look forward to wearing them under and on top of my pants. It's just a little hot now.,4
144859,"Pros : cost, obviously. This is a cheap item but it still works as it‚Äôs supposed to. Cons : only one temp setting, hot. So you will need high heat oil / spray etc or it will burn your grease for the waffle and it will taste nasty.",4
125447,"Work well! They are a little slimmer/flimsier than ones I‚Äôve used in the past, but that did make them easy to slide not only on the key but also on the key ring.

151925,"I‚Äôve had a few sets of bunk beds for my twins. By far this one has been their favorite. It‚Äôs very compact and leaves a lot more room in their room. I got the Black and it‚Äôs in great shape. I will say this took my husband a few hours to put together. Lots of parts!! The ladder going up was my only issue. The metal hurts my daughter‚Äôs feet climbing up/down. I tried a few different things to make it better and then I found my saving grace. A mega pool noodle!! Not just an ordinary one, mega. I cut one precisely and was able to get it perfect! Now she can climb up and down with out it hurting her feet!",4

142485,"it's still in wraps, but looks like a quality toy from the looks of things.",4
121056,"The older design was better, it provided more coverage of the screen as a whole. The new design leaves the glass above and in between the front facing camera and speaker exposed. This was my go-to screen protector, but I may need to find another.",4
142739,Smells great! You don't need to use very much and it's good as a setting spray.,4

138696,"Comfy like what I expect from Crocs shoes--can easily wear for 4-6 hours. But as they day goes on & my feet expand, the strap closest to the front of the shoe starts digging into my pinky toes. Nice neutral color--was not gold bling bling sparkle so it matches well with my summer dresses, cargo pants & jeans. Easy to clean/rinse since I wore them on the beach. I have ankle issues so all of the straps & backing on this shoe provided some support to where my ankle didn't swell to much at the end of the day.",4

135104,"The costume is great! I'm very pleased with what I got. Being an adult M i wasn't sure if i was going to need the next size up in order for it to fit. Thankfully it fit perfectly. Unfortunately the zipper gets stuck so bad. Last night I need help to get the zipper up, today no one can get the zipper up. It's not a size issue it's just the zipper. Ruins the look if the zipper doesn't zip!",4
125927,I was a little disappointed in the quality of these. The magnets work well and the size fits with the other name brand ones I have but the plastic is definitely thinner than the name brand ones. Overall good buy for the price!,4

129943,"IT IS FINE, NO OTHER COMMENT TO MAKE AS IT WAS SIMPLY A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE I SMASHED AT MY DAUGHTER'S HOME.",4
137942,"We've had this thing for a long while now. I have pulled off evidence of a many drunk drivers. Once or twice I pulled to show off some other dumb move someone did. However, today, when someone tried their hardest to kill my daughter and I while we were driving back from school, I go to get the footage, despite their being a huge sudden stop that should have triggered the emergency recording, let alone the constant recording it should have been doing, and yet, not a single frame of it was recorded. I have nothing to hand the police about the [censored] person who showed know consideration for the safety of other drivers and came within inches of T boning our car. I gotta say, I've been a pretty staunch Anker fan for years, but this is supremely disappointing. I even mentioned after getting it, ""You know, if this thing fails, we're not going to know until we absolutely need it"" and I was absolutely right, I just didn't expect that time to come before only having it for maybe a year. EDIT: Anker customer support reached out to me after I posted this review. They were very kind and understanding of my situation. They got me squared away with a solution. I am updating the review with a better star rating, because they did such a great job with customer satisfaction. Their products are extremely reliable, and outside of rare situations like I was presented with, they are definitely the brand to buy.",4
147283,Some of the reviews mention the kennel only comes with plastic nuts and bolts. The nuts are plastic but the bolts are metallic. The nuts molding quality is not great so the bolt's thread does not engage properly in some of them and they cannot be tightened. They supply about 5 spare nuts and bolts so you eventually find enough pairs that work together to assemble the kennel. It is easy to assemble but I only give it 3 stars because at this price you'd expect higher quality fasteners that work right first time.,4
137331,Fits more than I expected given the size of the opening. Seems to be good quality and comfortable to wear.,4
127891,"I bought this product for when I‚Äôm on vacation and away from home. With it being small it is very discreet and easy to tuck away. The one thing I was not 100% satisfied with was the app. It works decently but I feel it could be more user friendly/easier to use. Every once in a while I struggle to check it while away from home because it isn‚Äôt saved as yours. It is easiest accessed when on the same WiFi network, otherwise you have to put in much information to find your camera. Overall it is a really nice thing to have in my home because it gives me peace of mind.",4
121763,It is perfect. Shipping was on time. No issues with it at all.,4

120914,Great price. Screw holes slightly off but unnoticeable once it's on. It did come scratched so that may bother you. I figured it'll get scratched when playing anyway lol. Again you can't beat the price.,4
143417,Being my first product like this I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. All in all it‚Äôs a decent toy.,4

Unfortunately, the flash drive runs very warm, hot actually. Uncomfortable to hold! This gives concern to its reliability in the long term. Be sure to have adequate ventilation. If used as an internal USB boot drive, it's recommended to have it in some form of air flow pathway within the chassis.",4

134833,Nice looking bird house,4
131144,"Love these flip flops!, The little ""bumpers"" take some getting use to but once you do, it's a great feeling of a massage while walking. Great for fatigued feet and legs. They're also very cute with the earth sole! I would suggest sizing up because they are narrow.",4

155172,"Ordered size 14 for this shoe, overall the fit and quality seemed good, however, as I walked around the house to try them out, I realized the rubber that wraps around the toe ended up pressing into my big toenail. And they are a tight size 14, and I knew when your feet swell a bit with hiking they would not be comfortable. So I reluctantly returned them Sadly, they don't carry a size 15, and there are no free returns for the size 14, I am out $12.95 for return shipping with nothing to show for it and hope I get a refund soon... :(",4
135115,"I am 5' 10 and 165 pounds and purchased a medium. VEry nice product. Nice to have the full back covered so you do not see the bra fat rolls. I have this one in nude and got another in black. It makes you very shapely. The only draw back is the straps right at the arm pit cut in a bit so it is not great for wearing more than five hours. it is not a design flaw, it is jut the way it needs to be fitting to give you that slim look. Worth a try for sure and if you want to walk around in a fitted dress and get rid of ALL your rolls this is the product for you.",4

I wasn‚Äôt really sure what I thought about trucks as a subject matter before but now I am pretty on board. I wouldn‚Äôt go as far to say I am now a truck enthusiast but I do now look at trucks in my everyday life through a new lens ‚Äî one that appreciates trucks more. I would not recommend playing Trucks (and other games) at the workplace! I was let go because I kept playing Trucks. Though I'm not too worried about making rent this month because I‚Äôve saved up quite a bit of cash this winter and I recently sold my set of banana slicers which brought in a chunk of change. But if you want to help, I am still selling a few other items which you can check out on my Etsy page (mostly wicker items). I did try to use the pages of the book to press and preserve some small leaves, clover petals, local dirt samples, etc but the book does not weigh enough to do the job well.

Not obnoxious and doesn't bounce around the water bottle openings on machines. 2 small improvements would make it perfect - the lock should be off center and open diagonally. It sticks up a bit and you will hit your chin if running while drinking (see photo), and the strap is material and doesn't come off, so it will be wet after rinsing or washing. Also great perk that it comes with extra seal. I wanted a new bottle because a lot of them have silicone seals you can't remove and they get mildew underneath with no way to get it clean.

127205,"I dry brush my body and have had amazing results. I figured it would do the same for my face. I wet the brush as suggested for my first use and I did not like that. It was way too soft. Now I only use it dry. I started off and actually continue to dry brush every other day. The first few times my face turned burning red a few hours after the dry brush. This lasted for maybe 2 days. It felt like I had applied retinol to my entire face or got a sunburn. I kept going. I got a few pimples. I kept going. My pimples have healed and now my skin is dry and peeling in some places. Exact same reaction as I had to retinol. (Prescription retinol cream). I started to use argon oil on the peeling skin and that has helped. My skin is so soft and when the peeling settles down and it will my skin will be new and lovely. I no longer get red from the dry brushing and I am not getting pimples. It‚Äôs probably been two weeks of use. I don‚Äôt see much of a difference in my pores, (I have a magnifying mirror). My face feels tighter yet softer. My goal was to nix some of the slack in my skin and maybe help loosen up some wrinkles. I see improvement in my laugh lines but not forehead wrinkles. Pretty sure the skin is now leather on my forehead so that may take some time. Also gently working on eye wrinkles. The goal is to just get some blood circulation to that area. As a result my under eye area has seen less fluid accumulation ie bags. I love the idea and this brush is working well for me. It‚Äôs the only Facial brush I have tried so I have no comparison. I think the stiffness of the brush dry is perfect. Wet it was too soft for my 45 year old weathered skin.",4

Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating.

For Brazilian front and back, the front was ok I still had to go over with a razor and the back didn't really work I had to just shave.

Instead of the ball lip, all you can ""grab"" is the sloped ledge inside the ball, which with a LOT of persistence and side pressure might eventually get the insert to let go.

His recommended dosage was 5 tablets. There was no way I was going to give him 5 tablets to start with. I gave him 2 tablets on the first day and the second day gave him 3. On the 3rd day he started to vomit bile and it was uncontrollable. He is healthy as can be. He is 1.5 years old and we took him to our vet and they suggested that we stop giving him these tablets as it was the only new thing introduced to his diet. He lost his appetite the 4th day but continued to drink water. Sure enough the next day he was back to normal after stopping these tablets for two days. Stay away!,1

This product worked great for the first 3 weeks but even after routine maintenance and cleaning I don‚Äôt believe this product is worth your money. This product does assist in cooling a smaller space when ran on cool and packed with ice or the cooler packs provided! You do have to replace either option fairly quickly to keep the temperature cool. However I completed the 2 week recommended care but by ‚Äúclean out‚Äù they really mean that you have to basically take apart the entire product (10+ screws) to get a thorough cleaning in. I‚Äôve had this product for about 3 months and even with the completion of the routine care, it still stopped working! Unlike many amazon products- the return or exchange policy is very short- 1 month. 1 month of owning the product is not enough time to fully allow the cooler to run and determine the quality of it! I recommend not purchasing this product and spending a few more bucks on a quality brand!! Very disappointed for the amount of money I spent!",1

I understood those directions very clearly. However, you have to FORCE the bolts to go into place. It took me 10 minutes to do all the steps, but it took me at least 45 minutes to do the last one. And I still didn‚Äôt even do it correctly. The back of the chair is too far in, and I really cannot lean back. I wish I could return this chair. I regret spending $100",1

Nor should you have to be when buying a toy like this for a kid. Once you do fix this, the hoop is actually pretty nice. Just know, the screws will 100% not fit when you buy it.

Also, there is no PDF as promised in the description, although I have noticed now that they have changed the description, so I'm guessing there were other complains.

I assumed it was an fluke or an error on my part so I adjusted the blade attachment to the tool to connect to the unbroken part of the blade. While doing so, I noticed that the abrasive was failing but there was enough left to keep going. This time it broke within 20 seconds. I was going slowly to avoid putting stress on the blade, letting the tool do the work and not forcing it. Here is the second blade that failed by breaking at the connection. The first I threw away assuming it was my error. But when it happened again, I realized that I had wasted my money on this product. Please don't make the same mistake.",1

17024,I just got it and it's broke,1
13324,so far the bits I have tried were pretty solid sturdy Little Things but the tool itself I'm very disappointed with. the bent that you can see in the pictures happens the second time I used it when it barely tapped the edge of a finish nail and it through the heavy duty grinding wheel off and it just about went through my safety glasses. Also the first time I use it immediately it was almost impossible to tighten the part down that holds the collet in. also the flex hose I'm assuming must have been very poorly made because it basically fell apart the first time I used it. I'm very disappointed and I wish that I had waited and saved the money to buy a wen rotary tool or Dremel because I feel very ripped off. Will not be buying this product again ever.,1

180308,"Not much to say here other than I'm a huge fan of Micron pens. I don't recommend you use alcohol markers over them, but if you are just inking a drawing, sketching, or using them with watercolors, it's great. I think I have 6 in various sizes, and this one is awesome for fine detail work or sketching.",5
185448,Like how easy it is to install batteries and to fill with salt and peppercorns. Grinds really well. Would recommend buying this product.,5
175018,"These are very nice, makes me feel like a real biker dude! HaHa. Anywho they fit my palms as expected but are to short in the fingers but that is a common problem for me so I then ordered the extra large to get the finger lengths correct. For about 30 bucks I‚Äôm impressed with the quality. Made in Pakistan.",5

199926,Work great and good quality,5

177399,"This tray has saved me so much time. I left some solid frozen ground beef on it to defrost while I go do other things, and I was shocked at how fast the beef defrosted. The time was essentially halved. Great item! My family and I totally loved it!",5
185306,Works great for my Deebot!,5

166036,As promised...it works!,5
172161,A friend recommended this screen to me and after seeing his set up I purchased this screen. Very light easy to set up and just as easy to put away. I was worried that there would be creases in it even tho they say it‚Äôs foldable but there were none. The hooks and other accessories they provide make it really simple.,5

168380,"When we first plugged it in once we received, we saw that the spiders were still around and that the device wasnt working. Now that the repellent has been plugged in for within 2 weeks i‚Äôve seen no mice or spiders. I realised that on the product description that it states that the pest may increase at the beginning while the ultrasonic waves start to kick in. Since I plugged these in I‚Äôve seen none! Absolutely none, I can‚Äôt believe it. I am very happy with this product which has prevented bugs from invading my home. I have small children so the bonus is, it is chemical free, just plug in and it goes to work! I highly recommend.They really work! I would definitely buy more but just give it a few weeks to see the difference. Great repellent!!",5

166171,Well worth every penny.,5
166031,"The bag was delivered on time. I didn't know what to expect, but I'll say I was pleasantly surprised. The material is a little thin for my liking, but so far, it appears and seems to be very sturdy. I'm a truck driver, so I spend Sunday night through Friday morning on the road. It's large enough that I can take 6 outfits, underwear and socks. I can also use the pouch on the inside for my toiletries. The shoulder strap isn't very comfortable, but it'll do. I would recommend.",5
166582,Working well on my arthritic left knee !,5
174222,Works great on my electric guitars. Bought the Chrome one also as it seems to work better on my acoustic guitars. These are the best capos made as you adjust the tension perfect for your guitar.,5
196258,"This is one of those stories that could have taken a page out of every action movie ever and just focused on the car chases and shootouts at the expense of having actual, relatable characters. This story doesn't lack for action, but I ended up actually liking some of the characters by the end of it. The protagonist comes off as kind of the opposite of Indiana Jones, but by the end of it, I kind of took a ""wait and see"" attitude on whether he's really so incapable of being a hero. As others have mentioned, the character development seemed to not be as deep as it could be, but maybe the author was assuming that readers of this book had already read the first book. I'm kind of looking forward to the next book.",5
164273,This works well if you need the extra usb ports for a computer. I didn't have any problems with it at all. I plugged it in and it worked. We use this in a couple places through out the house so guests can plug in their devices for charging. Guests that are concerned about conserving energy like the fact they can turn off individual ports when not in use.,5
184489,"Good price, does it's job",5

175242,These are my favorite,5
164046,Worked as advertised. Not much else to comment on.,5
179165,The air filter cleaning set works great. The cleaning spray would be better with a hand trigger instead of the thumb mechanism. The aerosol Spray is easy to use and goes on evenly. Will definetely buy more.,5
