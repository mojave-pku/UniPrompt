127138,I’m used to Chicco brand so I’m kinda already spoiled. I didn’t want to spend an arm and a leg and i wanted pretty so i went w this one. I’m glad i did.... i can tell it’s made a little cheaper than the chicco... but it’s also cheaper in price. I would buy again. It’s great for the money!!!!,4
154940,I bought this to replace my Nexus 6 due to Google not supporting security updates after April 2017. So far it's working out really well and I expanded the storage with a 64 gig micro SD card.,4
132781,Not as good as others,4
154004,These filters were very competitively priced and easy to get delivered thru amazon Prime.,4
156618,It is a really nice skirt and it fit well. But I looked like a tub in it and there was no way I was going to wear it. I would have to weigh 10lbs. less to be comfortable in this skirt. I returned it.,4
130365,"Charges find, but batteries do not stay charged as long",4
128117,real good product except for the wey that in the bottom of bag .walmart may have a better price depends on the day ?Walmart has this same product a dollar cheaper,4
156480,"Reason for 4/5 is that, opening on bottom, only fits flat, lightweight cords. Any heavier duty cord, you'll need to carve out some of the plastic with a knife to make the hole bigger to fit cords (power strip cords, bases of phone Chargers don't fit, etc. )",4
146020,"little one loves it! Directions could be a little clearer, and be prepared to spend some time putting it together, it is not a 10 minute project.",4
153345,"The writing is to small for me (I probably over looked that in the description), but other than that it's great. I use it as a go to Bible around the home.",4
142602,I have really enjoyed these markers. The pigment in each marker is beautiful. My only wish is that the larger end were shorter so that tip was mor controllable.,4
159970,This is a cute little pan.,4
150480,"Bought two, one for the car and our truck. Both Fords, the car a 2012 and the truck a 2007. Took less than 1/2 hour to set up works as advertised. Good manual and it even came with a trim tool as promised. Nice form factor. It doesn't stick down into your line of site. Pros, As mentioned easy set up and works fine. NIce optics and the app is really good. It's easy to view and pull down videos to your phone. Cons, The aforementioned copy to your phone takes a long time. I recommend taking the Micro SD card out and copying them off with a reader to a laptop. Glare. At night the angle the camera screen sits at on the windshield reflects the instrument panels lights back at the driver. I'll have to get some stick on anti-glare for both cameras. Auto Shut off, The camera in the car turns off when I shut off the car...after about 30 minutes. The truck not so much. After shutting it off the camera chugs along all night long taking video of the front of the garage. For the truck I'm going to hard wire it to a switched circuit in the fuse block. I've orderd the kit and I may do it for the car as well",4
125300,Beautiful case and feels protective.,4
156495,"The included wall grabber mounting system really is a failure, but if you aren't going to hang it, it's great. I like the matting; it's actually two separate pieces with about a centimeter in between, providing a little depth. The tabs on the back and the stand seem solid, and... yeah other than that it's a frame and it does what you'd expect",4
143730,We're great!! Nice and bright.. I do see moisture come and go from one of them.. But it still works good!,4
140308,"Charger has worked fine for my needs. The fan is very loud as is the end of cycle beep but noise aside, it's great.",4
141553,"Lightning male plug fits well through iPhone case, but the microUSB female port seems a bit shallow (my cables plug in about 80% of the way). Also, these adapters are quite small, and can easily get lost ... glad they came in a 5-pack.",4
142428,Product is as expected.,4
129429,Arrived in good shape. I don't like the little metal strips to hold in the cheap cardboard backing but I made it work. I should note that the plexiglass is highly reflective making it difficult to see the whole photo in a brightly lit room.,4
157496,Each bag was nicely wrapped and came with a dust bag. Unfortunately the tote bag has 2 scratches on it but Amazon ordered a replacement with will receive within 2 days. Updated to follow.,4
135201,I like how this charger is a stand. It works perfect,4
121334,my only concerned about this problem is that the hinges are on the top instead of on the side like a book it would be a whole lot easier for me to have it open from the side and I feel like the product would be more stable in terms of latching. Outside of that it's able to hold report sheets and has a nice place to hold a pen on the bottom which I store an emergency pen because in healthcare pens disappear just as fast as pain medication :),4
151682,"I found the story contemporary and realistic. I thought the characters had many dimensions and I cared about them all. Nicola Moriarty is a great writer, this is my 2nd book by her, and won't be my last.",4
138462,Good product for the money! I bit thinner than I expected but overall good purchase.,4
138223,"looks great, but have yet to use them......as long as they last, I will upgrade the review later.",4
135209,smell good and last averagely long.,4
156374,"Unusual circumstances bring Allie and Slater together. Attraction keeps them connected in this slow burn romance where Allie discovers she can take care of herself and others. She and Slater are destined for great things, and fate seems to draw them together at a time when they both need more than a friend to lean on.",4
143074,"Pleasant story about a strong-minded lady who Is almost on the shelf and a not so pleasant gentleman who learns a thing or two by the story's end. Enjoyed the heroine's use of reverse psychology to get her adversary under control, a concept unknown at the time but one that I surmise she intuitively discerned because she was a pretty smart cookie. Good characters in a somewhat unusual variation on the bluestocking spinster trope. Glad I purchased this one and will likely reread it in future.",4
153628,"So excited to use this enema, very to use. If you want more info to assemble just check the website. Easy to clean too.",4
132550,"Product is good, but the rectangular magnets are not cut evenly. They are clearly different sizes.",4
138625,"The amber turn signal brightness is decent but not as bright as the stock signals. However, the red brake light feature iIS bright and the fact that it flashes a couple times before going solid red really draws attention to the fact that you are stopping. Very nice. The running lights on the front don't really increase visibility but do add a little style.",4
120218,Everything they said it would be. Some were better than others but overall they all were good.,4
145697,"My son is an intermediate illustrator and this tool works perfect for him. Along with the software available, this drawing pad is very helpful!",4
156001,"As describe, but the rubber part that holds the fuel lines in place is way to big to fit in the hole of the fuel tank. I was looking for that part as well as mine is dry rotted from the ethanol fuel used.",4
141196,Good for more energy but I'm want more sexual energy.,4
124872,"Highly visible, but reflective material on palm wears quickly. Great if you don't handle objects. Great for traffic control.",4
130591,"I think the added fiber with seeds make it different, I did get used to it fast. There are also different flavors in this brand that I plan on trying.",4
151751,If you enjoy reading about mail order brides you will enjoy this book. This was a good clean Christian book with excitement and suspense.,4
130891,A wonderful book filled full of stories,4
140023,"An excellent keyboard stand as described. Extremely sturdy and I never fear that my keyboard will drop on me while playing. However, the assembly instructions were a little hard to follow but not impossible as there aren't many parts. Overall, the assembly took 30 minutes instead of the 10 after I figured it out. Definitely an affordable, worth-it investment for anyone that needs a keyboard stand.",4
152869,I really like the mild flavor and how fresh it leaves the mouth. It also seems to have less junk in it then most mouthwashes. The bottles are small however.,4
121151,The controls are a bit confusing so read the directions but I'm sure it's made that way so that your kid won't mess with the function...but then second day I couldn't get it to the timer mode so I am a bit confused..otherwise I am continuing working on this with my toddler but he likes to take it off so I wish there was a way to make it more secure..otherwise the alarm is a little song...but my toddler does know it as the potty watch!,4
153241,Elegant and simplistic dress. Runs larger than expected. Great price. Would definitely try brand again.,4

138899,I am enjoying this new program and hope that it is renewed for another season.,4
148309,"I was expecting them to be a bit thicker and I assumed the print was embroidered, but it is more like a silk screen print. I haven't washed anything for an long period of time. I just hope the ink holds out.",4
126902,These were very very beautiful glasses. The couple we bought them for absolutely loved them. The first set we bought arrived broken- both stems! But Amazon was quick to send us a replacement. I would give them 5 stars if it wasn't for that!,4
147104,Could be larger and also the creases won’t fall out of fabric.,4
157501,Exactly what I ordered. I only gave them four stars because they are so cheap but it was exactly what I needed. I have had no trouble handing them out at work to the Millennials that need to feel appreciated. For simply showing up and doing their job no more no less they can get a sign of appreciation that they are needed. It really seems to boost their moral to know there is a reward for participating in their job.,4
159259,"I loved how fitting the case was to my IPhone 7 Plus. It’s really lightweight, yet durable.",4
135297,My daughter liked this set.,4
141095,Sounds awesome! Bluetooth works great. Glad I purchased this.,4
153956,Pictures shows product perfectly! Made of high quality metals.,4
131522,Very nice embellishment for my nose. Easy to change in an out and hide post.,4
142655,"This mirror was a great replacement except it did not cover the entire surface where my old mirror used to be. It doesn't seem to be the same shape, but it gets the job done and that's all I was looking for anyways.",4
148139,I did not use this item. It did not work for me.,4
156717,Shane and Larissa have history but it was just one weekend. Now they have a daughter and sparks. Where will this lead?,4
139666,It was smaller than what I wanted but that was my fault .,4
149000,They look exactly like the picture,4
140001,I am size 6.5 so I ordered 6-7 size and it fitted me perfectly. These shoes are very comfortable that I want to wear them while going out too. Perfect shoes to prevent feets from cold.,4
128627,Not my favorite summer dress but it looks very good and is well made.,4
149887,Cute ice cream set for my daughter. The pieces are made very well. There is a magnet on the cone to he the scoops of ice cream on. I would have given it 5 starts if they made the container large enough to store all of the pieces!,4
159075,Even thou the package arrived a bit damaged nothing was missing so that fine.,4
139667,I use these to store games as I do not have enough available shelf space to go that route. I had been using DVD storage boxes and found these to be better suited for my purposes. Being clear and stackable allows me to find the game I'm looking for quickly. They don't get a lot of abuse but seem to be durable.,4
121150,Easy putting together. All the parts were there.,4
157958,Not bad. I've seen far worse.,4
144065,Loved the characters and story line.,4
133402,Pouring slowly allows fluid to run down the side of the container - a problem with large glass container without a specially designed pouring spout on the pouring lip.,4
155532,"Quite heavy, but durable and very happy with these",4
126064,These worked well for DDD but we did use 2 of them on each side as they were thin,4
121443,Use on my Porter Cable heat gun to concentrate the flow of air. Works great!,4
124724,Love it so far. Feels sturdy and blocks the sun from a big area but that's more to do with the type of sunglasses. Haven't had time to test out polarized part but will see.😎,4
138175,"These high waisted pants are wonderful. The color is super fun and they are beyond comfortable. I am a big fan of high waisted work out pants vs regular waist line. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that I would have liked a bit more compression, which is what I was expecting based on the name of the pants. However, these will be perfect for my home workouts and running errands.",4
152414,The short chapters made this seem like a very short book. Yet I felt I knew each character well by the time I finished.,4
122341,It set up pretty easily,4
158871,Costume quality lightweight chain. Not much else I can say about it.,4
156463,"I can never get a comfortable hang, but that is just me. Seems durable and well organized. Perfect day bag for short hikes, park visits, etc Plenty of room for water, small first aid, kit, snack bars, etc.",4
134408,Really good n easy to use,4
152761,Works great so far. I like that the beeping isn't loud and the tip is flexible. My only issue is the button itself to turn the thermometer on is difficult to press and the screen isn't backlit so it's hard to read if it's darker. I take my temperature when I first wake up and it's still dark and I don't want to wake up my spouse by turning on the lights.,4
134483,was hoping tit would be a bit bigger. aside from that it is very well built,4
151927,Just like I would buy at the hardware store (don't stock any more). I wish it was not so expensive - otherwise I would rate it 5 stars.,4
158148,"Love the look of the bell, BUT the ring is very dull.",4
136584,"Good table and chairs for price. However, be prepared to tinker with the chairs. The back pieces are tricky.",4
147708,"I ordered this to attach to my frig to post calendar and other such things on -- it was WAY TOO HEAVY!!!! Must weight five or so pounds! That's okay for some uses, just not mine. It appears to be a good quality cork board. Just be aware that it is also very heavy.",4
148679,Sound quality is good. I have been told that when using the phone its a little difficult to hear my voice by the person I'm calling. Works as described though and they recharge quickly and hold the charge for a good period of time. I would recommend.,4
147092,It works. Pictures turn out clear. I like it. Was the best bang for the buck (pun intended)!,4
126716,"Overall, a good family movie. Recommended for good family fun.",4
122217,"Beautiful color, arrived earlier than expected, slime was cold and hard from being in delivery truck (broke apart instead of stretched). Once the slime warmed up it was more pliable and fun to play with.",4
148748,Great product for the price!!,4
139764,They actually look really good I love the dramatic look if you do too then these lashes are for you period.,4
134644,The foot on these is very short so anyone with mobility issues could have a difficult time removing them at the end of the day.,4
145799,Mints are effective treatment for dry mouth. Wish they were longer lasting.,4
150067,"Number 1: this thing REALLY works. It attracts flies like no other. I'd wager there are thousands in the bag I hung just a week ago. HOWEVER Number 2: It smells like a rotting corpse. Hang it as far from your house as you can. Stench carries on the slightest breeze! Number 3: As the bag gets fuller, the flies aren't dying as fast when they get inside--I guess because of the pile up of floating corpses, the aren't exposed to the liquid as quickly. This is giving them a chance to lay eggs. And there are definitely a few dozen maggots crawling around on top of the carnage.",4
134634,It’s nice and I am using it but it’s smaller than I though and a little pricy,4
149828,"Lifelike and cost. However, somewhat hot and limited vision. First place Kentucky Derby novelty contest at local club.",4
134637,Sturdy as advertised. Folds for easy storage. Large step,4
131155,"UPDATE: after using these once, they were much easier to open! I also received 4-5 replacement kids after contacting them about missing two with my order! They came within a couple days so I was very satisfied. :) I just got these and I’m sure they will work great but I broke a sweat just trying to open them. Which says the seal is good I guess. And then I began filling them and realized I was short 2 lids. 😒 Now I get to try to figure out to get two more kids.",4
132560,Very useful and handy,4
130743,"The oils are fine and the bottles are small. It's not the best value, but I wanted the bottles to refill. Makes it easier for me when I'm making my oil blends. I won't be repurchasing, but I do recommend for anyone who is just starting out. It's a good variety. I did purchase both pack 1 and 2 and the only duplicate is the grapeseed oil.",4
125852,There are totally cute. Not for long term use but fun for occasions.,4
127113,Perform as function well but cover could fit better,4
141538,With Solutech some colors work great and some colors are very brittle like in th case of lime green color.,4
146834,Dress was a bit too small but we made it work. My niece looked so adorable!,4
159419,Flattering style and functional. Nice material and comfortable.,4
144043,"*UPDATE* Almost as soon as I posted my first review, the seller reached out to me to see how they could help me be satisfied with the product. They shipped me new cases in different colors to see if they would help me like them more. I received a black, gold and clear case. The gold is shiny, not brushed like the actual watch is, so it's not totally something I would pick, but it does look a lot better than the clear. I used it all weekend while camping and 4 wheeling, and it did a great job protecting my watch, with little to no dust or dirt getting underneath it. Its annoying that you have to take it off to charge, because that opens up opportunity for dust to get under it when you put it back on, but I can live with it. The seller really wanted me to update my review to 5 stars, but I am still not there yet, as the gold is not a match to the watch, and therefore I dont think I will use it very often, and dont care for the black or clear, but otherwise, I think these are great cases. Original review: Punchline: I sent these back for a refund. Details: These cases will likely do a decent job protecting your watch. They cover the screen and metal on the watch. The cutouts line up nicely, and the touch screen works well with it on. That being said, it looks like crap on. The bulky clear case makes the watch look cheap and tacky. I'd rather take the risk that I might get a small scratch than have this make my watch look ugly for sure. See my pictures of my watch both with and without the case on to see what I mean.",4
136287,"Nice product though some articles can slide under the expandable parts. I use it to organize the kids bathroom drawer (toothbrushes, closers, hair ties, hair brush etc). Bought for konmari tidying.",4
126055,I have noticed a small increase in my libido. Also a little more energy,4
149455,The product itself is beautiful! Beautifully made and absolutely soft. It just doesn’t compliment my body- that’s not the manufactures fault so gave it 4 stats for exactly as described just didn’t work for me!,4
141576,"If you're looking for the cutest, funnest way to waste half a loaf of bread, this is it! The packaging was unusual, in that it was written entirely in Chinese, and it wasn't sealed very well. I can't read Chinese, so I had no instructions to go by, but the cutter was easy enough to figure out. Just put the panda head piece inside the black square, with the little rounded handle poking through the hole in the square piece. Then fit the black into the white square with your sandwich in between. Don't be afraid to press very hard on the handle to the panda head, because if you don't press hard enough, you won't get a face on your sandwich. Upon opening the sealer, you should see the sandwich is mostly cut, but you may need to cut/pull away some of the crust from around the edges before removing it, so it isn't still hanging on. The resulting panda sandwich is very cute, and went over wonderfully with the 3-6 year olds at my house. I just dabbed a little peanut butter on the outside of the eyes, nose and mouth to highlight the cuteness. It would be cooler with something black in those places, but I'm not sure what that could be. In any case, my kids ask for a lot more sandwiches now than they did before we bought this, and it wasn't hard to hand wash. Really the biggest downside is the amount of bread you waste when you make sandwiches in this, but I froze the crusts as another reviewer here suggested, and I'm going to try making something with them later.",4
128361,Perfect fit! Definitely makes the car look more sporty! Everyone with a 10th gen si should get these.,4
149501,"I purchased to help with skin tone. The good thing it is tasteless, mixes well in my coffee or water.",4
124910,I have used this on my cat because the nubs are softer and do not hurt his skin and fur as much. It can remove fur easily and also can easily be pushed out for easy disposable. The tool works most of the time and has a nice grip to it.,4
133125,"A bit challenging to assemble, but otherwise worked great. Helped out a lot with my ankle surgery.",4
151475,"My girlfriend got this for me for my birthday, and I absolutely love it. It spins nice and slow with a fan in the room and is a lovely addition to my gaming PC. My only slight annoyance is you can't turn off the lights, this is only a test issue but would make it a much better product to me.",4
124407,I'm a recreational user and for that use this scope is pretty good. Have taken it to my local park a couple of times and had fun learning how to use it. The phone mount is a bit fiddly but usable. Focusing at high zoom seems hit or miss. I’m guessing that it’s some combination of my old eyes and the phone camera trying to focus on the object image at the eyepiece. Need more time to sort that out. Probably could have spent a lot more $ but for me that was unnecessary. Excuse the focus in some of my images as it was my first time out using the scope and phone mount.,4
151997,I purchased three. One cob size for my mustang and two regular size for my quarter horses. I like the mesh and the fit a lot. My only suggestion is the Velcro straps at the bottom could use a better system. I had other masks last year that had a three part mesh system. One on the mask. A strap over that and another to close over the second strap. It make it real hard for my mustang to pull the other's masks off which he loves to do. All in all a good mask . the better closure system would just make it better,4
157625,product was what I ordered and delivered when said the wrong part is the review part,4
133794,"Fun, great to use when snow kept us indoors! Nice art work, busy, but real!",4
145273,"This product fits and is compatible with the models listed. It works well! The biggest downside is that a full charge is only worth about 3 hours of usage, but this is typical for older model laptops.",4
129157,Easy for my son to put on over other clothes. Great buy for classic Halloween costume,4
140257,"A little stiff. Had a good lining and was medium weight, but I returned it due to the stiff feel of the fabric, especially at the collar.",4
159372,"The mouse is light weight and compact. It takes only one battery and the size fits my palm (I am 5'9, btw) quiet well.",4
128856,I found these dented very easily when tapping to release the bath bombs. Otherwise simple to use but do not clasp or lock.,4
126461,"Very well made brush but would have preferred stiffer bristles, perhaps at the narrow end.",4
141467,"The are very nice jeans, not quite at waist or below waist just different, fit just a little snug but ok. I would buy again",4
146564,"I recommend for older kids. My 5 yr old had trouble using the small tool and taking the time to actually dig these out. Even for me, it was time consuming. I would recommend for kids who actually want to sit and do this for 15 minutes each egg. My 5 yr old just wanted to cheap plastic dinosaur in the middle.",4
147141,Works well and easy to clean but unnecessarily large. Heftier size wastes storage space. What breaks on these things is usually the wires which are still flimsey thickness. Wish they'd use blades to cut instead.,4
127516,Great shampoo and conditioner that have improved the condition of my over-processed hair. I only with that the conditioner was the same size as the shampoo.,4
135947,The hitch is very heavy and heavy duty. Not sure I like how the ball rotates to the back for storage. I prefer to just take it off the truck and put it under the seat.,4
120173,"This is a nice set for the price. I bought it for our guest room. I marked it down one star because the 2 little decorative pillows were squished when they arrived and despite attempts to fluff them up, they look too flat.",4
123547,I enjoy word games. This one not only makes you think about where The word is but what a word could be with the titles.,4
153750,"This is an overall great buy if you are looking for a carry mug for your hot or cold beverages. The elegant stainless steel design is combined with an excellent build quality which feels premium and is very sturdy. My hot or iced coffee which I bring on the go stays at the right temperature easily for 4-5 hours, however I have also used other carry mugs which can offer insulation for up to 6-7 hours. Moreover, the narrow and tall design does provide a good grip but a textured grip would have been more effective to prevent any accidental drops.",4
149355,"Most of clothing from Amazon don’t fit curvy girls,sorry the American,nor Asian sizes fit me.Please I need help.I love your clothing but they rarely fit me.Don’t make me shop at the store,",4
148376,These have worked well for me. It's best to just leave them on the boat rather than screw on and off as that takes its toll on the clinch.,4
128181,It works pretty well but is not as comfortable to use as I thought it would be.,4
157881,This is my go to wallet. I love how low profile it is and it’s easy to fit into my pocket or clip onto my lanyard. The clip did come undone and fall off my lanyard once but I recommend attaching the chain to something sturdier.,4
140942,"I need a reliable way to connect to the internet and my computer doesn't come with an ethernet port. This one does what it is supposed to so I am satisfied. It also comes with 3 USB ports that I use to connect to external hard drives, cellphone, and camera. It would be great if it has a USB-C power pass-thru port so I can charge my MacBook Pro as well.",4

143160,So far so good. Enjoying this. It's good for the brain.,4
154283,We love these pull ups! They are pretty absorbent. The training pants sides can be a little rough. They are bearable if you tightly fasten them. My son and I wish they only came in Cars characters though.,4
158811,"Noce star, good size for what I ordered and was expecting. Color is nice, but the material feels kind of cheap. Feels more like plastic. Would give 3.5 stars if I could.",4
134399,"The shampoo and lotion cleared up my dogs skin in a couple weeks, which allowed her hair to grow back. I have spent so much money on different products and I’m just glad I finally found one that works for her. I just wish it wasn’t so expensive since I have to bath her once a week and I use the lotion daily.",4
153017,My son loves it and works perfect for when we go out. The suction is really great but at the same time I can barely get it off the table when he's finished lol,4

149461,"It didn’t work for me, but I thought it was worth a try",4

143196,"These are very comfortable. These are not glamorous or sexy and I don't think they're supposed to be. They are great for work and great for working on the farm with the animals. I've lost weight so I wasn't sure what size. I could have gotten a 10, but the 12 is fine.",4
120370,"So soft - and such vivid colors! My grandson loves it - his big sister has a mermaid tail that made him just a little bit jealous, so now he's set with this ""macho"" one! I even got him a soft orange astronaut helmet to wear with it - it's perfect! (Gramma Scores!)",4

123207,I love the keyboard because it actually works and I use it day to day. The only complaint I have is not being able to put it into a case when I'm done. I use the box it came with instead but it looks tacky. I haven't had an issue with the keyboard other wise.,4
132948,I like it. I wish the range was a little better.,4
140563,"**Revision** This product was messy for the first 4-5 applications, but after that it stopped leaking. It is easy to apply and goes on smoothly with very little color (big bonus for me). It seems to prevent sunburn, is smooth and goes on light and easy. I really do like this product and am using it every weekend at the moment. I think the product works just fine, but the packaging is awful. I opened the package and powder was EVERYWHERE! I thought maybe it just got shaken up in shipping, so I carefully used it, pulled the sleeve back up and stored it in its' box, sitting upright on my bathroom counter. The next time I used it - powder everywhere again! I really want to like this product, but if I lose it all on the counter each time I use it - it is not worth the time or money. Maybe I got a flawed applicator?",4

134627,"Love, love, the shape and small size of the diffuser. It heats up immediately. The only thing I was questioning was the oils. It was suggested to use 2-3 drops, but that did not produce enough of a smell to appreciate it. Used twice the amount and the aroma was perfect.",4
125162,Bought this for beauty regime and it works great. I do not know about the taste as it is just used on the skin but it smells fresh and feels great.,4
159931,I stopped buying Logitech products a few years ago. Their gaming keyboards were crap. But I took a chance on this wheel and I have to say I'm quite happy with it. Maybe Logitech step their game up. I use it for Euro Truck Simulator and it works great!,4

131136,Bags work very well. Much better than used plastic grocery bags! Great to have two different sized. So far so good!,4
158760,These are super cute and super innovative. I really like having one in my purse and it works for me when I want to sit at my able with a low light (while everyone is watching a movie) and read crochet directions. It's good for digging in my purse to find something on a dark night. BUT this is not the brightest bulb. It's not going to shine a directed light like a flashlight. You won't be walking through the woods saying 'oh let me pull out my lightbulb light'.,4
128283,Great little lamp. Gave it 4 stars since the shade was slightly damaged when it was packed it in the box. Luckily we have the lamp in a corner so the damage is not noticeable.,4

125096,I tried to use unit right out of box and only flashlight worked. Then I charged and still same issue. I was preparing to return unit and I noticed the safety pin loose on my counter! The unit now works properly with safety pin IN the unit when firing. I give only 4 stars because this is something that should not be loose and should be attached to unit. Perhaps it was attached to unit and I am going senile and took it out! BTW: There were also no safety pin instructions on directions but perhaps I missed it because the fine print was too small!,4

120331,Super soft and a great fit.,4
124931,I should have looked at the fabric (it's polyester) that makes this garment hold in body heat. very uncomfortable for me. But this caftan is well made. It has nice stitching. maybe I will re-gift it.,4

I did not attempt to clean and reuse pad. Im pleased with the longevity of this pad due to the type of material being applied.,4
121476,"An Excellent Movie! Animation dated, but the storyline can live on forever. My daughter found this on Prime used to watch it, she said 100 times, so I know it was a lot. I watched it to remember, but I didn't. Still, the kid that lives forever in my heart enjoyed it and was so glad to have watched it, whether the first time or 100 times.",4
124397,"The outside of the box was very scuffed up and crushed when it delivered so I was worried after reading some reviews, but the inside was packed well and no damage to the unit. It assembled easily enough, only one side didn't match up perfectly but the mattress covered it up so not a big deal. I added felt tabs on all the bottoms to make it easy to change the sheets. My 11 year old is happy with it and it does look nice.",4
159737,"Cute set! I was able to put this together on my own during my kiddos 2 hour nap time. I like that the cushions are thicker and firm. Hoping this will last a while in the Florida weather. Will be looking into a cover for it, but overall sturdy and just right for our patio.",4
157371,"had to change out the suspension rods in my washer, worked for lubing the attach slots",4
159182,"The product was packaged securely and arrived in new condition with no shipping damages. All advertised contents were in the shipment. The primary wiring harness for the light bar was provided but there was no wiring harness for the spotlights. Purchase of additional wiring for the spotlights is necessary. In addition, electrical wiring connectors and zip ties are needed and not included. Installation took two people about two hours. The pre-drilled mounting bracket holes aligned perfectly. The existing screws were removed and were re-used. The light bar works perfectly and casts a very bright white light. There probably are some differences when compared to more expensive lights. However, this particular light is good quality and provides good value for an affordable price. My only complaint is the wind noise at higher speeds which would likely be the case with any light bar.",4

121004,When the mattress pad came it was unzipped in its original plastic packaging. It was dirty. So I washed it and put it on the bed it definitely has a cooling effect to it. because I have a TempurPedic mattress it seems to hold in the heat this. my husband seems to think that it has made a huge difference for him. The fit for the king size mattress was perfect and it washed great?,4
150957,Product lived up to expectations,4
121524,Good product has been a month and feel like it’s been helping! Ordered more.,4
124119,My daughter loves it but I will mention that the wire throughout the tunnel hurts the knees when crawling through it.,4
137190,"Work well, good quality, nice to look at. My only complaint is that it has a button rather than a switch, so it is impossible to tell what mode it is in when it is not dark. I wish it had a switch of some kind instead of this weird button that is hard to tell if it is activated or not. I also discovered it has three modes, on with motion, off and then on always when dark. There is no way to tell which mode it is in when it is not dark, and you have to cycle the button on and off again to switch. I found this rather frustrating, but otherwise the product is great.",4
121028,Works great on the series 1. The microphone holes don’t line up perfectly as I assume it’s designed for series 2 or 3 but haven’t noticed issue. Other than that it fits great and is well made and a good look. Only issue for me Is it is REALLY tough to push the band release button so if you change bands often you might be disappointed. It definitely works just pretty tough to get it to release the band.,4
122767,The case is nice and probably saved me from dinging the remote multiple times. The strap piece of the silicone ripped however so I can't use that anymore. 5 stars if the silicone didn't rip.,4
140126,Good app for toddlers,4
136283,Wouldn’t say it’s worth 40 bucks.... missle won’t shoot and the slide is cheap and falls off but my son loved it so I guess that counts for somthing. 40 bucks tho 🤨,4
143712,"It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but it was cheap and works decently well",4
124087,Didn't realize that the cutting edge did not go all the way around. It is a beautiful die and I will use it.,4
129032,I love it so far. The only thing is I wish some of the accessories were a little heavier steel. Other than that I'm impressed and will begin to seriously look at everything Tacklife produces. Heavy duty cord heavy duty casing and I have never owned a heat gun with the digital settings before. Only time will tell but we are using it right now at my daughters so it will continue to get a real work out! The more I use this the more I am impressed. We even used it to start our charcoal for the grill!,4
121318,works good but need to inform people that it is a slide on blade replacement,4

152137,Works great. Not the best for writing or drawing but great for navigating iPad and avoiding prints. Tip it’s too thick for that but it serves its purpose as described by seller. If you want to navigate and some writing. This is the pen for you.,4
135307,"I do love the playtex bottles! But the drop-ins itself have a little more to it. The 8oz drop ins are a little harder to push all the air out if your not filling the bottle or if u have shorter fingers. They can break if you apply sharp force, like a finger nail. & They are not advised to be put in the microwave. In all, its to be expected. & Worth it if your little one has any tummy issues.",4

138011,"Initially, these slippers felt a bit stiff, but were still comfortable. After walking around in them for a while, the memory foam created an impression of my foot. The impression seems to make a custom fit. If you accidentally put the slippers on the wrong feet, the foot padding feels stiff and bumpy. I might purchase them again, but I prefer a memory foam that’s a little more fluffy.",4
157587,Very sturdy and a good height. I would suggest getting the extended though. I got the regular and wish they were longer.,4

136336,"Does what is supposed to do, but not for long wear, it irritated his groin area. He was sensitive and in pain for a couple of days.",4
123010,I wanted a pair of leggings that I could wear while working out as well as for an everyday look. I absolutely love the material. It is not thin to where you can see through and they are super soft. They are warm to wear outside in the cooler weather. They are great to move with your body when you move. I also like that they are high waisted to hold it all in. I ordered a size medium and they fit great. The only issue I have is that the inner leg seam (crouch area) is not reinforced very well. I like more of a wider material are rather than just a single seam.,4
158539,Soft big a bit high in price,4
121560,"All Black, fit great even with mods. Wish I didn't have to sand of the bottom bump to remove mods.",4
154850,Worked out very nicely.,4
130979,Its pretty big but it works fine,4

138938,"Really good, comparable to Green Mountain and Starbucks.",4
123696,"It would be nice if Stanley would make a smaller set, and a larger set. Instead they try to meet many needs which adds to price. I use the small punches (along with a set of roll punches) for simple gunsmithing. I don't need punches to disassemble cars.",4
152316,"Beautiful form fitting dress though it still hides my small post baby bump. I did need to have it altered to my height, it needed the zipper moved up to hide the back of my bra and keep the sleeves on my shoulders. Other than that..... perfect.",4

136720,Just pushing upwards those buttons ( volume and channel ) is not easy but not a problem. still like what I bought.,4
145165,"These are ok; I mean, they hold stuff, which is the point. Nothing keeps the sides standing up other than fabric stiffness, and putting more stuff in there will help them out a little, but they look pretty slouchy.

138925,Would have given it 5 stars if it came with a tempered glass screen protector.,4

129332,Cute but did you ever try to get a 5 year old into tights in this HOT weather!?,4
153077,We love it. The extra cushion is perfect for my 5 month old who is still a little wobbly sitting up on her own. She is really comfortable in it. The plastic phone holder fits my s7 with a thin case on it but it's tight so it wouldn't fit anything much bigger. She loves sitting in the cart where she can see everything vs the stroller where she can't. We use it often. I only wish it was easier to carry along with us. It need it's own travel bag.,4
135074,"Exactly what I needed, Priced was good, arrived on time, well built, will buy again if more are needed.",4
145928,"I knew what I was getting before I ordered online because I tried the shoes on at a local shoe outlet. Some things like shoes I'd never buy online without seeing or trying on elsewhere. No surprise on the fit or color or anything else. Basically I ordered through Amazon because they were $9 cheaper than the sale price at the shoe store and qualified for free shipping. No brainer. They look good, fit well and are comfortable for me anyway. Edited two weeks later: I still like these shoes from the standpoint of fit and comfort. However I have an issue with the color that was not apparent till I wore them in bright sunlight. They are the dark brown color which is fine in shade, artificial light, and at night. However, it bright sunlight, they have a definite dark olive green tint to them which I don't really care for. I hope that it eventually fades. Cut score to four stars.",4

128105,"For what it is, It is a great little drone for beginners. I have used it to teach my 6 year old how to fly drones and he loves it. Photo quality is not bad for what it is. You can shoot usable photos from it but do not expect DJI quality photos. I think I like the durability the most as it is very durable. Many collisions with furniture and things outside learning to fly it and it still flies well without damage. Only con I can think of is the battery life. I wish it could be more that 5-7 minutes. Range is limited but for my purposes, It is not an issue. I think we got it 200 feet without any signal lost and around 20 feet off the ground. Will be flying it more this summer to really get an idea on its longevity. i do like the App too. Very similar to DJI but seems to connect quicker.",4

3330,"I have Lutron Caseta throughout the house and have been running it for months - the automation / connectivity reliability for Lutron is rock solid in comparison to this manufacturer - was looking to integrate this device with HomeKit automation of my lights. This is not ready for prime time: 1. Pairing is sporadic. Device is active, but sometimes presents itself to be paired, other times not. Attempted pairing on multiple devices, different iPhones and iPads thinking maybe it was just my iPhone, it wasn't. 2. Device updates are very delayed / latent - as in minutes, sometimes as much as 10-15 minutes. This is supposed to be a sensor that operates in near real time, not sure what the deal is? 3. Automation in Homekit is unreliable. Set up a very simple routine, when it senses movement, turn on the lights. The sensor would blip that it picked up motion - half the time, it would not trigger the automation routine at all. Other times, the latency to trigger the lights would range from 10 seconds to as much as a minute. What's the purpose of that? I'll just turn the lights on manually if it's going to take THAT long. This can't be with Homekit, it's got to be with this manufacturer. With my Lutron set-up, when I turn on the lights through the Homekit app, theres almost imperceptible lag time and 100% reliability to trigger actions, as it should be.",1

People couldn't hear me when I used them to talk on the phone so the dual mic didn't work well.

I contacted the company and explained the situation that I just need the pants sent to me. They basically said oh well, you can return for a refund. I don’t want to return for a refund.

It sprays uneven ... leaving wet splats on your face, it expels too much at a time, the spray is too wide . I'm going to put it in a different setting spray bottle. I don't think my makeup really last any longer when using this. I wouldn't recommend it. It was $12 for two bottles so it's a decent value but I'd rather pay more for a better product. Update:",1

9641,"A nice idea that is undone by the poor quality. The batteries are a clamshell construction of some brittle plastic. Within a week the two halves had separated. This is likely to occur since when they are inserted into the heel of the insole, there is just a little indent to grab it with your finger, right along the seam. There would be a little tab that allows you to pull the battery out of the insole They replaced the defective pair and the same thing happened with the replacement. I tried to glue the batteries back together but they continue to split. It is also hard to tell if they are working. There is a little green light that flashes when turned on, but it is hidden when inserted. There have been times that one turns on and the other doesn't. Now I have four cracked batteries and no functioning insoles after spending nearly $100 With a better design, better engineering, better materials, and some quality control. this could be a good product.

1547,"Beware of the misleading information about tis protection plan. They will do everything to get out of actually protecting your product from offering false information from the time that you call to file a claim for a defective product to the time to offering reimbursement. I purchased the protection plan for a defective keyboard and when I called for replacement options, I was initially told that they do not replace items but instead will issue a refund of the full amount to your bank account. Acting on this information, I went ahead to repurchase a new item to ""replace"" the item since I will be receiving the refund of the value. A couple of days later, I receive a phone call from Asurion changing their statement to state that they would instead offer a gift card instead of refund to my account. When I tried to explain that this defeats the purpose of replacing the item since I would have no use of the gift card, the customer service rep on the phone went ahead to school me on the difference between insurance and protection plans all the while avoiding a key mistake that an employee of theirs made by providing a different information earlier. Its not worth the headache! Choose a different protection plan",1

Imagine my surprise to find that the box had been delivered to me in the shape of a banana and with hundreds of shards of tempered glass floating around inside. I didn't even have to open it to know what was waiting for me. Poor protective packing? Poor handling? Probably both. The worst part about this is now I have to deal with the pickup process and wait another two weeks before I can get a replacement.

It can be glued together, but this was a gift, so a little embarrassing to gift something that needs repairs before even being used. On the plus side, the dominoes are nice and thick, feel like good quality (aside from the chipped piece). The train station is better quality than many I've seen.",3

I love the feel of the matte finish, also how writing and drawing with the Apple Pencil feels kind of like on paper. However, I ended up taking it off because when viewing anything on a white background there’s like a color dot pattern that interferes with whatever is on the screen. If drawing, I can’t see the detail of the drawing even if I zoom in because of this pattern. Doesn’t happen if the background is black though. Anyway, it was too distracting and I just had to remove it. Bummer.",3

116778,The story is cute but it is so small. I have gone back and looked and I still do not see where it says it is a miniature book. I did not read the reviews like I usually do so I was very disappointed when it came. Tiny books are cute but they are hard to keep on a shelf.,3

97620,"I bought this item on a Black Friday 2018 deal, so got a major steal. I keep the case in my everyday carry bag in the event I'll need to charge my phone on the go. In my opinion, the case is too bulky to be an everyday case. I wanted to put it to a real test, so I recently let my phone battery drop to 1% and then plugged it into this Mophie case. With minimal device use during charging, this Mophie case was able to charge my iPhone up to 86%. In my opinion, this is disappointing given Mophie's claim of ""100% additional charge"". The case does make charging on the go a little more convenient than a spare battery/lighting cable set up, but like I said, it too bulky to be an everyday case.",3
116643,I like this dress but I don’t love it. My biggest complaint are the shoulders look like they have shoulder pads which makes me look like I have man shoulders. Major disappointment! I naturally have broader shoulders so I avoid puffy sleeves and shoulder pads like the plague. I didn’t realize these have more of a puffy look in the sleeves. I wear a jean jacket that helps but would have been nice to be able to wear without. The other thing I don’t like is the tassel rope isn’t removable. If you like the look of the rope dangling down then this won’t bother you but for me I ended up not liking it and wished I could just remove it. I’ll cut it once I find my sewing kit and remove it without damaging the dress. For now I just tuck it in so it can’t be seen. Overall it’s a nice pattern and material is comfortable.,3
111038,Very small. Half the size of a normal pillow.,3

116419,"Was expecting a lot from this product based on the reviews, but unfortunately not as effective on my hair. Did not see any difference in the time it took to straighten my hair or in the controlling frizz. Overall texture of hair was more dry and wild when compared to the usually sleep look I get when I straighten. I do have thick and coarse hair, so that may have been a factor.",3

119327,"Kind of unsafe in that I have to hold this in one hand and force my very sharp knife into the guard. This isn’t like a sleeve that I could just slide the knife into and is more like a pair of pinched plates that I have to wedge and force my knife into.

I have been using it for a while and I haven’t seen any sparks but if there is no noise (almost impossible in my house 🤣) you can actually hear a very soft sound coming from it, I don’t mind that, but it does not charge my iPhone as fast as my Apple iPad block so I use the block and my 2 younger children use this to charge an old iPad they use.",3

109848,"I bought this for some new wrist/arm pain likely carpal tunnel related from my office job (undiagnosed but it runs in my family). The compression offers a bit of relief which is great while I’m working because the band itself allows me to move similarly to how I do when I’m not in any pain. The hand, however is so loose it doesn’t help much and my thumb is the same as before. Also, I highly recommend AGAINST sleeping with this sleeve on. I fell asleep around 11 and woke up miserable by 3 because it had rolled down my arm and cut of most of the circulation to my hand. My fingers couldn’t bend and were swollen to twice their usual size. If you need a sleeve/wrist band for pain relief at night, use one with a splint.",3
112923,in the day time they are fine and I have 3 of these. but you have to find just the right spot to put it. not much rotation once you secure it down. one of mine is in a window with a screen in it. and its video quality through a screen is horrible. It only takes a small clip of what it is. I pick up lights so far away it makes it take a small click of that frame. and when it gets closer it doesn't come back up and video when That car actually get's close to the house. I put a small memory card in it and there is still not any more run time on the objects once it picks it up far away. I have seen people walking down the street then it shuts off the clip and when they get closer to the house I have no idea if it's for here or not. because it doesn't come back up.,3
87791,"I ordered a 4 tuner Recast prior to it's release, receiving it on November 14. Overall, I really enjoy the unit, and it's relative ease of operation. It has a couple of ""glitchy"" things going on. For instance, when pausing live tv, often times the playback will jump a few frames for no apparent reason. Another interesting thing that I have noticed on a couple of occasions is when playing a program from the DVR, if another program starts recording, the program being viewed will stop. To continue viewing the program on the DVR, you have to go back to the DVR menu. Luckily, it will pick up where it left off, but a glitch none-the-less. The most disappointing thing I just yesterday discovered is even though I have the 4 tuner box, I can only watch 2 streams at a time, regardless of what their origin is (tuner or DVR). This means you can't even watch the same channel in 3 locations. I'm not sure what the reasoning of this restriction is, but the advertising of a 4 tuner box is a little misleading. Overall, I like the unit. I hope my observations above can be addressed in updates. Ken",3
98213,"This keyboard/mouse combo is fine for limited usage. In my case, I just wanted them to occasionally use with my work laptop while at home. This keyboard and mouse will not be satisfactory daily, frequent usage. Both are extremely basic; there's nothing special or notable about either. They do the jobs they are meant to do, with some minor issues. The mouse is pretty small. It's closer in size to a 'travel' mouse than a standard desktop, wireless mouse. Otherwise, the button functions and scrolling work as expected. The keyboard size is about standard; I didn't have any 'learning curve' in adjusting to key spacing or size. The wireless range of the keyboard seems to be pretty limited. On my desk, close to the PC, it works fine.

109760,"These are a bit more flimsy than I thought they would be. Only bought them for my guest bathroom, so they don't get too much abuse.",3
99287,Extremely stiff difficult to install but fits proper after install,3

100038,It came cracked a little. Still works great though,3
104040,Cant use it my laptop died when I installed it. Don't want to blame it on the battery as the laptop was giving problems before.,3
81613,Came with stickers on it that I couldn't get off. I bought it for a Xmas present and ended up buying another copy to give as the gift.,3
107792,Digs in a bit with almost no stretch. Plus it’s HOT (temp wise),3
114198,"I like it fine,But would like it alot more if it was thicker .Its too thin.",3
112434,It looks way smaller than I expected. It is more for the ladies.,3
109142,worked did not last as long as the other one I had with the original machine.,3
99541,I've only had my case for 3 days and the black covering has already started shedding. I am not pleased considering the price i paid.,3
86627,"Cute boots, good fit, but one of the lace loops was broken. Returned.",3
103808,Should furnish Google's. Dangerous to face.,3
86429,The light looks cheap and doesn't have a great effect.,3
85545,"It's more runny than I expected. The last brand I used (can't remember which) wasn't quite so liquid. Pay attention to the amount that's on the brush's stick because it's so runny that if you're applying while holding the brush sideways it'll all run off the stick all over everything. Very annoying. It should be a little thicker to prevent that from happening. My biggest complaint with anything that has a brush in it is that the brush does not reach the bottom of the can so you'll waste about 1/4"" of the stuff at the end unless you use a different brush which is a total mess. This works ok, but I'll try another brand next time.",3
80724,It's a wonderful thing to have but I got it for less.,3
81408,Could be a bit larger in order to surround the ankle of larger feet. The pockets that hold the ice pacs could also be larger so the pacs slide in and out easier.,3
98653,"One of the cords doesn’t work. I plug it in and it decreases the battery instead of charging it. Of course, it’s the shortest of them, the one I needed for my car. Maybe I’ll try another batch.",3
102377,"It works as protection, but the thickness on top around the volume and channel buttons makes difficult to use it correctly.",3
95605,Not a perfect fit. But does the job,3
112671,It became discolored after one wash in a dishwasher,3
84487,"When my feet started hurting during work outs, I researched which shoes would help the most and this pair kept popping up in all the journals I was reading ...so I tried them out. They helped with the pain I was experiencing at the bottom of my feet but now I have a new issue with a blister like wound that won’t heal due to the way the back of the shoe rubs against the back of my heel. Also the rubber on the bottom of the shoe looks like it is shredding ... I would not have expected either of these issues after just a couple of weeks. I would not recommend this product at this quality, at this price.",3
99620,"These seemed to work great at first, but then the rivets started coming out. Then the boxes started slipping down to the floor. They need to make them deeper or with more of a lip on one side of the rim so it can't slip down.",3

112383,"One cable works perfectly, the other doesn't work at all. So i paid twice as much for one cable. It's not worth returning both cables when one is good. Next time i will buy Monoprice cables. Buyer beware.",3

95547,"nice small book, just to much religious stuff for me",3
107968,As events kept unfolding in this story I couldn't help but think there were too many things that went on in this ladies life to the point that it was ridiculous.,3
88028,My husband has a pair of TaoTronics so I decided to give them a shot. I was really excited when I ordered these especially since I was able to get $8 off and got 1 Day shipping! Unfortunately the ear buds are too big for my ears. The part that hooks behind my ear won’t actually curve over the top and hold it just sits there. Very disappointed.,3
105319,"Like others have said before. They are very dim, even with two bulbs in the same fixture. It’s not enough light to fill a room. There is also a lot of connectivity issues when using the Home Kit app.",3
110414,"I bought this for a Halloween costume for my kid, but it didn't even make it through the night. The gun broke in several places and isn't durable at all. It is overpriced for it's cheap design. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",3

86148,"Head and body were as described and as pictured, although the body came folded up into the head and as a result, is a bit misshapen. Legs/feet NOT as pictured. Image shows boot type. Actual is basically fuzzy pajama pants and slippers.",3
90813,The phone case is durable. It's a little to big for the phone though and it kind of bugs me.,3
87562,Smaller then expected,3
118803,"Typically, I prefer a round bottle set, but after obtaining a new pack that required to me to make changes to my kit and how I carry it, I bought this canteen set. I have not used the set yet, but have made the following observations. The handles on the cup swing far to freely in my opinion which will make it difficult to manage heating and cooking in the cup around a campfire. Probably less of a concern or issue on stove? The cup when it nests on the bottle of the canteen seems quite loose and rattles a bit on my set. If the set was 30 or 40 dollars I guess I'd expect things like this, but at a 158 dollars? I realize much of the cost is driven by the material used to make it and I can't complain about how lightweight the set is, but I suspect I'll be selling this set off to someone at a discount and finding another solution to carry my round bottle set with my new bag. I don't hate it and I don't love it. First bit of kit I've owned that I've been this ambivalent about. I'll admit, it's probably a piece of kit that the opinion of it is dependent on the needs of the user. If I were a through hiker on the AT or PCT and counting grams I'd probably have a different opinion.",3
111969,"Dull blade. The handle is square and uncomfortable. The sheath has a loop not a clip, which I prefer. It seems sturdy just not sharp or nice to handle.",3
118306,Cute but small I should have paid more attention lol my fault.,3
112588,The qaulity of the finish on the parts is a 10. However the gauge and thickness of the tubing and cage wire used is subpar. Many cage accessories use the cage wires as mounting points....these being very thin and wirey make mounting things very sketchy.,3
113303,"This seemed huge on my little dog, even though I measured to make sure it was the right size. The quality was very good, but I had to make a new hole to use it.",3
118985,Was cracked somewhere prior to delivery.,3
95579,"There’s no true Rewind or Forward buttons, as these are shared with the Up & Down Volume Controls. I find it cumbersome when I’m in the shower and want to quickly skip a song or replay it, but end up affecting the volume instead. Otherwise, in the last 30 days I’ve used it, no issues.",3
99886,The bag is smaller than I expected.,3
107657,They stretch and have to be adjusted to fit right leaving material to gather and roll. But are easy to put on and do help my legs.,3
108391,Nice aroma but a bit too fruity for my taste. Very fragrant.,3
117878,"I found this shampoo to be very drying for my hair (somewhat thin and curly), but it definitely does clarify. Also a little pricey in my opinion.",3
98609,"All good, but I don't seem to use them much.",3
93792,I like it but it causes some irritation on my skin after wearing for a few days.,3
96548,Loses color and dust sticks to the cover.,3
85770,Great underwear and lasts. Somewhat true to size. I always order a size up for kids underpants no matter what brand. However one of the reasons I chose this product was the colors advertised. I received totally different colors and prints but the size and style was correct. 3 stars due to the colors not matching what is shipped.,3
111978,Fragrance is great. Shampoo doesn't strengthen/thicken as well as other products available at the price point.,3
83503,They don't stay up like I was expecting. The top will roll down as you move around during the day.,3
99869,"I love that it's made in the USA. It was not effective for my cavalier with muppet-feet. Not enough room to scrub her feed, and very messy. Awkward to get her feet in there. I prefer to stand her in the tub and wash each foot - quicker and more effective for me, unfortunately.",3
111113,Tastes delicious and mixes with almond milk well using a mixer ball. The bad part is the chai flavor meal replacement shake did not take away my appetite and I'm starving an hour later and if I eat this shake for both breakfast and lunch by dinner time I'm soo hungry. The other types of shakes by this brand did a much better job at keeping me full all day without being hungry.,3
84278,For the cost expected something more regular solar crackers are cheaper,3
97723,The weight is great. The color is great! Just know they aren’t teaspoon size.,3
110047,"Too thin, doesn't go far",3
100764,I bought this for my dog. My vet recommended it since I make my dog's food.,3
96333,Not extremely sturdy feeling. Handles jiggle a little. It will still get the job done I guess. I still wouldn’t recommend though.,3
111501,Not sure why there needs to be a hole at the top of them. Have to make sure you place them up right every time or you loose the milk.,3
113903,Quite a bit bulkier than I was expecting definitely durable not bad to write with but it does feel larger in your hand,3
81617,The application runs too slow on 3 year old Amazon Fire 7!!,3
83059,"Loved the colors, and great value. The lasting ability was not as good as others, but for the value, it was great.",3
97673,There are many VPN apps. This is defnitely one of them.,3
80666,"Looks good, easy, easy to assemble. Instructions and parts w/ Hex wrench included were shockingly easy to use and assemble. Overall solid parts, arms a little flimsy. Quality overall is very good. Head rest may prove to short even when adjust to it's highest position for people with broad shoulders and 'normal' torso length. Arms not very sturdy, not adjustable (I missed this in the description--my issue). Overall, for the price, will work for the time-being. Comfortable enough, but not a top tier product--quality = pricing so I'm happy.",3
104037,Not the best tasting but it’s nice to try something new.,3
88152,I need a very thin pillow due to neck damage. This pillow is very full of stuffing and does not fit my idea of a slim pillow a slim. I am not able to sleep on it. I cannot answer the other question since the pillow is brand new.,3
114575,I really like this one but I see a tear on this cushion seat from normal use. I don’t know for how long it’s going to last.,3
83734,This thing stays wobbly. Nothing has fell but the wobbly nature of this even adjust is less than desirable.,3
105780,"I have purchased this in the past and it was great. But this batch is bad. The thread pops in the machine all the time. I spend over half my time re-threading the machine. Colors are great and bright and shiny, But HATE the thread breaking all the time. I most likely will not be buying again.",3
98265,"Fit the bill. We're trying dance with our tot. Didn't want to spend a fortune on ballet slippers in the event she didn't care for dance classes. The fit was just right. Ours did arrive with a minor blemish when taken from the package (see pic.) And, we did not receive the pair that is pictured in the listing - ours has one strap versus the listing picture with two cute criss cross straps. Overall, I'd recommend these if you're looking for a budget pair of ballet slippers for a little beginner.",3
114321,"This was a very good story, well written. Riley's phrasing drew pictures. I really did enjoy the basic story. What got to me was the firearm details. So much back and forth between the two guys. The first half of the story really seemed to drag on. I knew there was more coming so I kept reading even tho I almost quit twice. The second half was much better. As I'm writing this, I realized there was not much emotion coming thru. It was written but I wasn't feeling it. I did go ahead and get book #2. I'm hoping it's better.",3
115123,"Enjoyed it for what it actually was..a short story, but decent to read. Going to read #2 next. Fingers crossed",3
102773,It would be a 5 star but they sent the product with incomplete materials. They send 4 bolts to connect the pieces but didn’t include the 4 nuts to secure the bolts. I contacted both the seller and amazon and was told they can’t just send me the nuts... I would have to do a full return/refund and re order it. How SILLY!! So instead I went to the hardware store to purchase the nuts. The product itself is a 5 star but I didn’t buy online to have to still go to the store to get parts for it.,3
81150,"This is more the first part of a book, establishing characters and motivations but lacking real substance. Clean prose (no major spelling or grammar errors) and well written dialogue. Depressing, since it only establishes the main character’s situation. It’s not bad, it’s just not good. I will not be following this series. I prefer my novels to contain a full story. Even a novella should have more story than this did.",3
114410,"These are just okay quality, but difficult to find this size so using them for now. Might be better for lighter weight fabrics; my drapes are a heavy velvet.",3
103159,"Cute shirt, but it’s shorter than I expected and it shrank up after first wash. I’ll try it on again, but it might be going back. I’m sad because I do really like the lace on the chest. It is a comfy cute shirt I just wish it was longer.",3
93414,"There is a lot of conflicting information about whether these were different than the factory speakers, these were the same for me, and sound equally horrible.",3
108953,It was an interesting concept but didn't really come through for me. It was enjoyable but i just thought it could have been so much more,3
84737,Computer doesnt work once installed but dont know if it's the product or me,3
87628,I really wanted to like this pillow. My neck was hurting for weeks. I read other reviews that had this complaint. My husband likes the pillow. No neck pain for him.,3
96779,The feather part doesn’t feel like it is down compared to the comforter I bought but is very comfortable.,3
98565,It works fine but it's really loud and it's on all the time.,3
88998,Bought it as a gift and my father thought it was too small for a tennis bag :(,3
85439,The hanger is very pretty & I liked the design. It looked just like the photo. However when I asked my boyfriend to hang it he was worried about supporting the weight of the instrument with only one screw. If you will be able to hang on a stud it may be fine but we were only going into drywall. We also felt the angle that it was held out from the wall may warp the neck over time. I ended up returning it & getting something with better support.,3
117965,this fragrance and the Gain were both a bit too strong but I am trying others.,3
85398,Looks great but hard to remove from lashes even with eye makeup remover,3
116739,"I viewed the product as it was an actual throw pillow, not cover. That is not the impression these pictures of the product. It ended being better wall art also because it was a very pillow like fabric. Burlap or hemp or something like that.",3
116530,Chair is really nice but the bag has black stuff on it like it was rolling around on the floor or in the back of someone's pickup truck,3
91611,"I liked the function and options, What i didn't like are: low quality materials of remote control, need specific software in order to work, cant modify the darkness or size of magnifying or size of pointer",3
97881,Same style and set up as my last one and I love the pocket options and decent storage for more than 1 baby. The original I bought from a different company is now twice the price as it was when I bought my 1st one so tried this company since is was the same style. This one seems like material may be cheaper and not as durable. One of my zippers have already broke! And things seem to fit a little more snug in this one,3
90617,"The product doesn't smell good but the seller packaged the item very well and shipped very quickly. Unfortunately, I realized that I'm not a fan of this product at all",3
106564,"Disappointed that this mattress pad doesn’t feel any cooler or more comfortable than any other mattress pad I’ve purchased. I was expecting it to be cooler when sleeping, as described. Sadly, it doesn’t do that. But not worth the trouble to return it.",3
105442,Super cute. Can’t reallt put weight on it and cheaply made. One came broken out the box but I super glue it and it’s fine,3
118241,Very tight around the neck making it difficult to put over your head,3
81593,The box came completely destroyed. On a difficulty scale from 1-10 of how difficult it is to prepare and apply this henna is about 5/10. The results only lasted 2 weeks. Will not buy again. UPDATE: Within 3 weeks the henna came out of my hair. I only wash my hair once a week. Barely changed the color of my hair. Still...won't buy again.,3
110976,"The elastic bands need reinforced right away, otherwise they are worthless. The pockets are truly deep up to 18” so that’s a plus. Nice fitted sheet for the price, minus the elastic stay bands.",3
99833,Hi is there an answer key? some of these games require answer it would be nice if I dint have to google the answers. Giving this product three stars because of this issue otherwise pretty paper.,3
81412,"Flavor is so-so. Not bad, but definitely tastes artificial. Tastes better when It's not the dominant flavor in the drink. I've found SF dark cherry of this brand to be much better than the strawberry. SF brown sugar cinnamon is the worst.",3

At first she avoids him, but as he keeps coming around, she starts spending time running with him. When he asks her out, she's excited to go. But the damage from her research may already have happened, and she might not just lose Seth, she may lose her life. I enjoyed the story. It wasn't the most amazing thing I've ever read, but I was excited to continue reading the series.",3

116795,"The watch is nice, but since I received the watch it slowly get's off time. I kept thinking I most have bumped into the knob that let's you change the time, but that was never the case. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do to fix this. It frustrating because the watch should have never come like this.",3
114746,My boyfriend loves using this on me. We use it frequently but the problem is that the fur started to get detached a bit since he likes to put it in and out of my asshole.,3
105459,"It's effective -- you can put things in the basket and carry them around, but the basket doesn't sit flat against the front of the walker. I even ordered a Drive walker thinking it fit *only* their walkers, but nope, still does not sit flat against the walker. This means the basket isn't level either. It is easy to put on, lightweight, and will carry things. I just wouldn't put any liquids in there without a lid or anything that you need to remain flat. So if you need the walker and need to feed yourself, you cannot transport food or beverages easily.",3
94175,"Purchased gate so my mother didn't have to step over the Super Yard. I guess it works, its just finicky to get it to all align and close properly since the plastic gate structure isn't rigid enough.",3

108284,"I really enjoyed this book. I would have given it 4 stars, but there were so many grammatical mistakes that I downgraded it. Get a decent editor!",3
92884,Like the dress and material but too short and neck and arm are tighter then i wanted.,3
93855,"The mat seems to be of fine quality, suctions-on to the tub fairly well with some minor floating-up. The weird thing is that if you relax on it for a bit the spaces/pattern of the foam mat will actually imprint on your skin. It's like it gives you tiny hickies all over your back in the grid foam pattern. Very weird and a little upsetting. Also, you can feel the hard suction cup structure through the mat in some positions. Those criticisms aside, it's sturdy and of good quality and I like the pillow aspect.",3
113487,"I like the rubber coated gloves, however, the small size purchased fits as a medium, which in my case are too big. It is difficult for me to find small size work gloves, so I have to settle for medium sizes. As a package handler, it is important to have gloves that fit well not only to handle packages but to operate computer devices as well. Disappointed.",3
101733,I like it and used it quite a bit then the piece you push down to make the dimple for the stuffing came unglued. It’s a shame I really liked it.,3
83103,Why end a book in the middle. I get you would want to split the book to make more money but please at least finish the scene. It is very annoying to many readers (I am one) if a book ends like this one has in the middle of a scene. You can leave cliff hangers to keep readers wanting to come back but this was not a cliff hanger this just stopped in the middle of a fight. Urgh...,3
118458,I didn't realize the (demensions) size would be so small. I thought it would be full size like what i have gotten at BestBuy in the past.,3
101813,Monogram was disappointing,3
119060,"Will leave a trace of the cover on the screen, very tasteless design",3
88108,The place where you put your pencil in a little small. It’s the perfect fit if you take off the cap. I just took a sharpie and made it a little longer and wider. Don’t make it to wide or too longer where the pencil will fall out. If made to wide you can just simply super glue a piece of ribbon or elastic.,3
98864,Was a little disappointed. This book didn't suck me in like the first.,3
92444,You get what you pay for. Not so good quality.,3
87507,"UPDATE- I messaged the seller and was issued a refund Adorable and functional, but it ripped after just packing and boarding my plane. The rest of the straps seem fine, but super disappointing. At least it wasn't crazy expensive",3

87724,it wouldn't stay in my mouth!,3
85038,Clips that line up with the mounting locations are a bit too big. Transfer the clips from the old headlights in order to install.,3

Mine are just over 1 year now, and this wheel simply is not rugged enough to handle them.",3
81543,Obnoxiously long. I returned.,3
94435,It was ok but remakes of classics have to be really good to impress me. I'm a tough critic. I loved the book. The original movie was great. This remake changed some key things that I wish they didn't. If I never read the book or saw the original movie I might have liked this more.,3

114053,Ok but did not stick on corners long,3
110036,"Packaging was horrible. The plastic and cardboard were all dinged and ripped and the plastic wasn’t even attached to the cardboard. My niece was interested in the doll, but it looked like it fell off the back of a truck and was run over. The other doll I ordered arrived the same way.",3

191875,Great for collectors/gifts for animal crossing fans,5
162647,I am so excited to get this sweat vest! Fits great zips up easily. Fits and stays a lot better then a normal sweat band or waist trimmer. The smell of the material goes away as soon as you soak it in water with soap. But all and all great product.,5
175714,Works perfectly to attach a large propane bottle to your MR. Buddy heater,5
185089,I bought these for my twin 5 year old daughters! They absolutely love them. They love they are designed for little girls. These are high quality and I love that they come with a hair tie!,5
170741,Great smell and product feels good in the beard,5
167627,This thing is just as good as the high dollar ones! It doesn’t snag in your hair and your hair is super soft when you’re done. Dries hair quickly and cuts down in time since you won’t need to straighten it after!,5
160209,I bought one like this for my stepdaughter. She liked it so much as it helped her with her back pain I decided to get one for myself. I am very impressed with this. I am walking tall and not slouching. My back feels good. Thank you for such a great product.,5

I installed them, adjusted them, and went out for a test drive and they worked great. I then went on a forty-eight hundred mile trip thru the north-western US and they worked perfectly. I've tried some cheaper brand brake pads/shoes a few times in the past, with sub-par results, and I have always gone back to Wagner products.

163627,It is colorful and makes it easy for me to locate my Kindle.,5
188280,"Easy to assemble out of the box without instruction. Fits together snugly and disassembles easily even after use. The mesh bag for storage is heavier gauge cordage than you'd expect and it's roughly the size of a small camp cooking kit with room to fit fire starter and lighter in there as well. To light I used one cotton ball and small twigs, piled on larger ones. Started easily and, even with damp wood it worked well with a minimum of smoke. I tested it with a standard size camp coffee pot about two thirds full. It took awhile to get the rolling boil, expected given the amount of water, and probably about the same as a gas stove. Once a rolling boil was achieved it was easy to maintain feeding a few occasional sticks. Letting the flame burn down to the coals produced a simmer. No mistake, you do have to feed it frequently, about every two or three minutes but easy to do with the opening for that. The flame was similar to a gas stove once the flame was established. A little less uniform than a stove but controlled. Once the fire is out it cools fairly quickly and leaves only a fine cool ash that is easy to disperse in the woods. At a bit over a pound I wouldn't take it back packing but it has a place on every canoe or car camping trip. It's sturdy enough for cast iron on flat, solid ground. The base is broad but there are no stabilizing legs on the bottom to further guard against tipping. A few rocks around it would do well as long as it doesn't block the air flow from the base. All around highest ratings.",5

I've been using it in both our diffuser and our humidifier. It brings such a relaxing and fresh scent into our rooms and I swear it helps so much with coughs and colds. When buying essential oils, I'm extremely picky, so I'll only be purchasing this brand from now on. Just 2 or 3 drops is more than enough. The eucalyptus is my other favorite from this brand as well. You can even throw it in the bathtub for the kiddos when they are sick or place a single drop on the bottoms of their feet at bedtime. I can't say enough about Art Naturals. They've definitely got me hooked!",5

187594,"I've had this for a few months now. My everyday wear is high-end handcrafted expensive Spanish or Italian dress clothes. I can say, it even looks good with them, and anything else. I'm very particular to my purchases, and I am 100% happy with this one. I am an average sized guy, normal arms and wrist. Face is sized very nice and accordingly. This watch displays everything necessary, with a not too bright light that enables you to see in any condition. Good for nighttime so as to not blind you. I like the contrast of the shiny face casing and smooth matte stainless steel band. When clean, the face has a shine that looks beautiful. Also, I oddly prefer digital to any Rolex cause it gives me a different perception and feel, of time. Just the right weight and durability. I've used the alarm a few times, worked great. It's all easy to set up out of the box. I got it through here to get the real deal and avoid fakes (Which, there is a lot of out there).",5

Got them to hold off though they were crying, telling them that a better product would be coming. Got home, and these had been sold out on Amazon! Contacted Liberty Imports, and they assured me that more would be coming in the following week. They came through thankfully! Just finished a sleepover party of 11 girls, and threw these out there in the dark. No other product that I'm aware of has the retractable saber, led lit, and sound effects.

182257,"I own too many Coast lights to count... or 9, and this is the one to beat them all. Don't get me wrong they are all super bright and have good run times and functionality... but this one is in a league of it's own. Don't let the fact that it's made of plastic sway you. This light is just as tough and durable as any of Coast's other lights, if not even more so than others. It has become my new go-to light. The flood beam will light up an entire camp site and the spot beam will go further than I could ever really need it to. And the three modes are great too. High is almost too bright for indoor use and low gives useable light with an astonishing run time. Cycling through them is easy with the momentary on feature using a half press of the button and easy to lock in with a full press of the button. Focusing is also super quick. About one half of a turn is all that it takes to go from full flood to bullseye spot. What else can I say? I love this light! Try using some nice disposable lithium batteries for even higher performance. I did and there is a noticeable difference over the cheap batteries that came with it.",5

It's on the softer side so I was hesitant at first but seems to be holding up just fine. It's a little on the large side so my lab likes to play with it but fetch is a little difficult for her.

That plus the depth of thought on the nature of war, duty, and obligation. Excellent!",5
165249,"I hate those things but if you live in an apartment in NYC, you're going to have to deal with them every once in a while in the summer. Hopefully not too often. It got past me a few times but when I cornered it, I got it. Those suckers are really tough and really fast so I can say that this product does what it says it does. (It went down the toilet. Maybe I'm just a cruel, heartless person but I'm not concerned with being humane to those monsters).",5

Still, I like good quality shots that do not require editing. This lens worked great on my 60D and with the 430 EX III-RT flash. The filters are exactly what I needed to complete this set. The cleaning kit was also most useful in the carry pouch provided.",5
187878,"I was looking for something else( not for candles at all) when came across these candles, and just decided to get them. Very happy with this product, given the fact that it’s hard for me to pick the scent. First of all , the package is super cute and this set is perfect for gift. Secondly, those little candle jars are very nice too, and they could be used as little storage after the candle is gone. Each candle smells different and and the scent is very light and pleasant.",5

My kids take it for school camps and you can get all their clothes and equipment in plus their sleeping bag and a pillow. Secondly, it is well made. The fabric is thick and the rings where the handle attaches are metal. So it is useful and it will last a long time, that is really all you can ask for in a duffel bag.",5

168333,This is amazing. I have lower back pain so I thought I would give this a try. Its great at helping with the pain. It helped relax the area that is usually in pain. The heat is a great addition and the fact that you dont need any lotions or oils it a great plus. If you have issues with deep muscle pain or just want a nice massage without goin anywhere give this a shot.,5

195191,"First of all, the magnetic installation is a brilliant design. It was amazingly easy to install and I was actually really impressed at how perfectly aligned the magnets were. For such a ""cheap"" product, I had expected them to be at least slightly closer together or farther apart than the switch plate screws. When I started to apply the cover, it practically snapped into place on its own upon getting within a half or quarter of an inch away from the plate. The magnets are the perfect strength for the job--weak enough that it takes no effort to remove when you are ready to remove it, but strong enough that accidentally swiping your hand over the switch out of habit does not cause it to fall off, and strong enough that it takes no effort to apply. My fiancé recently installed a lot of Phillips Hue smart bulbs in the house and it's been fun and convenient to be able to automate our lights and control them with voice commands--the only problem is the light switch must remain on at all times and turning the switch off also resets our saved brightness defaults. We both kept accidentally flipping switches to lights on the home network, and I came across these nifty covers and ordered a couple. They don't look out of place over the existing plates and they were very effective at preventing us from accidentally flipping the switches we wanted left on. I'll definitely be ordering more since we just moved to a new place and my fiancé keeps accidentally flipping the garbage disposal switch that is next to one of the kitchen light switches. These are really handy!",5
188919,We had our first litter of puppies this year and I was so nervous about the messes in the kennel area so I purchased two of the EZ whelping pads. I bought two so I would never be without one while one was washing. This helped so much with the babies! They are amazing! They work so so well.,5

165141,I just got a new car and after spending so much on a car I wanted a good cover to protect it from the harsh winter as I don't have a garage to park it in it. This cover was deff the answer. It is super easy to put on and it folds up nicely. It also drys super quick which is nice as I like to fold it up and put it away when I drive instead of having to wait for it to dry. would reccomend,5

It tastes better than most sweeteners including Stevia brand. However, the sweetener taste is still there even though after using this brand for years. We just got used to it and it doesn't bother us at all.",5

169527,"Plenty of space. Heavy duty plastic, looks like it's sealed quite well & won't break too soon. The top where the hanger is looks to be reinforced with a stronger plastic. The two came nice and flat. I'll have to order more for my grandparents",5
177497,The feel of it is great! I have s/m and female with small wrists and it fits great and don’t have all that extra rubber left over on it. It’s a true s/m sized. Other bands I’ve bought for s/m should’ve been m/l size because of all the excess on it makes it really uncomfortable. This band does NOT do this!! Very light weight and feels good on. I would recommend this.,5
160428,I’m so excited! These actually worked I was surprised! I’ve got three kids who love to spill their drinks at the restaurants!! Momma was prepared today! It is on the cups they give u at restaurants in picture.,5
177778,my sister put them in for me and it was easy to put in. Lighter than I expected and will buy again.,5
75540,Very disappointed in the bag. It's made of thin cotton and small in size. Better off with the $.99 bags from the grocery stores which are bigger and sturdier. The sea turtle is what prompted me to buy the bag but $6 is a lot to pay for the print alone. Not worth the trouble to return.,2

The quality is subpar. It is something that would work for backyard parties. Nothing like weddings, baby showers or anything of somewhat importance because of the quality. For anything else as I said these would be perfect. Bought these to use as table scapes for a dinner party. Wasn't able to use them because they didn't arrive on time and I only received one. Which was fine, I would have been too embarrassed to use it.",2
71937,The sound is pretty good for it's size. But it doesn't have any native way to stream you computer audio. For this price you would expect to work normally with a computer. Or to have a Bluetooth option too. Only with a 3rd party software you can stream audio from your computer but with a huge downside which is video/audio not synch correctly. You will see the image first then hear the audio with a delay. This is disappointing. Sonos should have a native option to stream PC audio.,2

57291,"Bought in November. Died in February. Super cute design that looked great in my bedroom. The sound quality was not impressive, it’s not a dance party speaker, but that was ok because I mainly used this for white noise to go to sleep. Another quirk, the circular volume dial goes up and down in too many decibels with each incremental shift, which made it hard to get to the exact volume I wanted for the white noise. It was tolerable until it started turning on for 10 minutes, then shutting off. Very frustrating. Not recommended. If you care about quality, it will fall short of expectations.",2

73900,"Update: Processed the item for a return to amazon after only 3 weeks. One of the main reasons I purchased this was for the massive interactive display. Unfortunately, this screen is the only source of information for your workouts (distance/time) even when not using it for a guided training session. After about 6 uses, the screen would intermittently not capture data from the rower. In other words, I would be rowing - but the distance would not increase or change. Additionally, the rower was continually dropping connection from my network (wireless hub in same room, 15' away, direct line-of-sight.) . This made loading any workout videos or training sessions nearly impossible. Finally, the unit alerted that it required a software update, but upon continuing, the unit became stuck in a constant state of failed-updating. Even when the power was cycled, the unit would return to the failed-update screen. Upon contact with NordicTrack, they directed me to their tech support section - which was less than effective and extremely frustrating to interact with. I quickly decided to return the unit given the problems I had experienced in a short period of owning it. Oh, thats another thing... returning this thing is sort of a pain. I didn't keep the box it came in, so I contacted my local UPS store and talked it through with them. I eventually lugged this thing to them and had to pay $50 for them to construct a box that could package this thing for shipment. It was sort of a puzzle trying to get UPS to accept this, as it is near the max-size they can accept before it's considered freight. I think this unit has massive potential, but the control hub (a.k.a. screen) needs some overhaul and improvements. My original review from the first week of use is below: Original Comment: Great machine, great build quality, and definitely fun to use! -1 Star, because I feel like the massive display screen should have more functionality, a dedicated power switch, and Bluetooth capability.",2

60883,"This is not my first Phillips Norelco hair clipper. It is my second. The first one still works and I keep it for the features the second one does not have. Like a smaller clipper head for trimming around the sideburns. (But, hey, you can purchase a second clipper to do the job that the original clipper used to do...) The reason I purchased this second clipper was because the first clipper comb attachment tabs broke off, rendering the device usable but severely compromised. This second clipper - albeit lighter in weight - still suffers from the same design 'flaw' - (read: planned obsolescence) that the first one had and from which this second one will, no doubt, suffer. The problem is that the comb is very difficult to remove for cleaning and to reinstall for normal use. The plastic tabs (the ones that broke in the original clipper) are ridiculously difficult to work with. You're never quite sure they're in or out or how to hold/squeeze the dam thing to get them in or out. I do not want to manhandle this thing, but I am almost forced to by this ridiculous (but, obviously profitable) design. The sad truth is there's nothing on the market that I am aware of that will do the 180 deg pivot like this thing does, and so we're stuck having to buy this thing again and again and again... On the plus side, when it works it works well. But the piece-parts will keep breaking and Phillips Norelco will keep on selling the same old crappy design as long as the money keeps rolling in. Hey Phillips: stop selling this crap and fix your design!!!",2
67283,"I absolutely loved this little thing! It was exactly what I was looking for on my 6 day, 600 mile trip. The problem was the mount on the handlebars was way too weak and it fell off constantly. By day two a bump in the road sent it flying down a cliff and I never saw it again. If it were attached better, though, it would be a steal.",2
53582,"I'm surprised at so many good reviews of this speaker. This is supposed to be a 20 watt speaker, but I didn't think it was as loud as a 10 watt speaker I have. It didn't have much bass either, an important factor for me in a speaker. I didn't keep it long enough to know how the battery was, nor the water resistance of it.",2
49099,"Why is Amazon sending me out of date tomato seed? This seems kind of shady. Please update your stock or Let me know ahead of time that I'm to receive last years seed. That way it can be by my choice to try it or not, but at least not have to return it. Would like to hear from amazon about this.",2

53609,"The product tastes great. It’s one of my favorite Atkins bar. But they are always sold out in stores so I ordered three boxes online. Like another reviewer said, the caramel was squished out and stuck to the wrapper leaving it impossible to enjoy as designed. All three boxes were the same. Maybe ordering outside of summer will help but I’d definitely look in stores first.",2
51025,"It was really cute and I was excited but I ordered the XL and it fit like a medium or small, especially considering it’s supposed to be flowy. The shorts were quite short as well. I normally wear a L or XL so I was disappointed that these were so small since many of the reviews said they fit true to size. The material was really nice. I ended up returning them because they were ultimately too small but wish they were bigger because I really liked them.",2
60339,"This is the first type of screen protector I’ve used on a phone. I struggled a bit with touch sensitivity on this but that’s not the biggest issue. Today, just 2 weeks after installing this protector, I noticed that it cracked. I’ve never dropped the phone or sat on it. I bought this as I plan to sell my phone in just a few short weeks. Just testing the iPhone Xs and I need to sell it like new. The phone has been perfectly cared for. How terrible that this cover breaks in two after just a few weeks of normal use. EDIT: Contacted the seller and they are shipping me a new package, no cost to me. This is great customer service.",2
41913,Was not even close to the color blue advertised. Wanted a neon blue for summer toe polish and it's not even close to that. It's a dull baby blue or dull sky blue. It's hideous.,2
57947,The problem with buying from a picture is not knowing how it will work when you get it. This cam without the proper screws so we had to improvise. Also the way the legs are set that only children can fit between them. The cushions are also inadequate and the glass top is dark and if it is exposed to the sun the table is unusable and dangerous to touch. I would not recommend a purchase and ours is going to the Goodwill.,2
77921,My son loves this car but the amount of time it runs before needing to change the batteries again is going to make this the most expensive toy we own. It’s really ridiculous how quickly it eats up batteries. I think we will find a different one.,2

62389,"Described as a wood sign. It's pressboard with a wood frame. Welcome and wood grain on sign are printed on.

43959,Could not pick cherries with this cherry picker. Better for picking pears or larger fruits.,2

46937,Had to send this back as it was completely see-through.,2
79450,No a very good movie. Tom Cruise was boring and the plot was weak. Story line was under developed. I did like the actress that played the Mummy. Wish the movie was more about her character and less about the predictable Tom Cruise character.,2
75069,doesn't fit all pots and very flimsy not easy to clean at all.,2

73517,"The unit is powerful, charges easily via a USB cable and seems to run well and consistently. But, I dread using it as it seems to occasionally grab hair and tries to pull it out before it cuts it. It's quite painful. I'm a guy who is fairly pain tolerant. However, I'm looking for a different model to replace one I've had for decades that never did that. I should have tried to return it, but it's too late and not worth the effort. I am surprised that I'm the only review I've seen with this issue. Perhaps I got a rare defective unit.",2

40089,"The Bluetooth reception is rather good, but there is a very loud and constant static when pairing that is not there with a wired connection. I tried cleaning the aux output and then resetting the device, which made it unusable altogether since it is stuck blinking red and blue lights. I initially got this because I was impressed with the different capabilities of the device, but after using it, I am unlikely to purchase any product from the manufacturer unless I am in the market for something that flashes red and blue lights on a five hour battery.",2

55622,Easel is too flimsy to stand and hold a canvas painting. It is difficult to figure out how to set up with no instructions. I am returning this.,2
45367,Every battery came pre-charged. The charger seems to work fine. That is the good news. However at least 4 out of the 10 batteries can't recharge! I am not particularly optimistic about the rest. ONE set has. At least that is something.,2
59950,I would rate higher but the screen protector does not fit and cannot be attached. Will need to return.,2

63151,"This did not work. At least not for the couple times I used it. It just scraped the top of the ice and never got it off my windshield. One thing that I have to say is great about it is that it can be used as a funnel, but that about all it’s good for.",2
45390,Way smaller than size indicated. Almost no material in the front.,2
76769,I have not worn a bathing suit in about ten years. It’s very flattering but it didn’t take long for one of the strap holders to rip and not keep the strap on. I would order again just because of how flattering it is though!,2
56914,Super cheap. Won't give you an option for valume up or down... Returned,2

74453,"The torch actually ignites the butane about one in every 10 clicks, and then it only ignites one side of the circle for an awkwardly curved flame that lasts a few seconds max before going out. I have adjusted it every way I can see to do, and it marginally affects the height of the flame and ignition rate. The torch itself is attractive and has some cool attachments, I assume for creating more of a heat gun than a direct flame, but it won't stay lit long enough to make it useful for anything.",2
44398,Doll packaging was a mess and looked opened and put back together. Very disappointing since it is a gift. Embarrassing to give to someone since it doesn’t look new.,2
62967,"It is very cute but it keeps falling on my baby face, it’s not really safe even that it’s a very light weight.",2
48618,Disappointing. I thought these would be uber comfortable... not really,2
41417,The bottom of the ring was all bent. It was okay - not in as pristine a condition I would have expected...,2
69725,Cover is way out of alignment but it didn't cost much. I guess you get what you pay for.,2
43222,"Supper cute, runs very large!",2
40121,Did not help remove the rounded bolts. In fact it just rotated around the bolt even though I used power tools to tighten this device tightly onto the bolt. Then there is the required need of extra space just to fit the device which makes using it a bit tricker in most tight spaces. I would not recommend it.,2

Edge left a sliver of carbon fiber in finger. Trying to remove it half if it broke off under skin. Had to dig into skin to get the rest of it out.

65907,Why I'm disappointed? the condoms you can't figure out what is what based on the colors. I haven't found any ribbed ones yet! I also haven't found some others. Everything so far I used was normal. It is a random pack not a pleasure pack so I will not order again.,2
55164,"I’m really disappointed because I love the way this looks and feels and it’s easy to get on and off, BUT it keeps catching and snagging on my clothes. I’ve been wearing it for a week or two and I’ve been putting off switching back to my old band, but today it snagged my favorite pair of pants so that’s the last straw! If they could fix the edges of the bands so it wouldn’t catch on things then it would be 5 stars!",2
52313,"Bought the biggest size available, which is a size bigger than I normally wear, and it was still quite a bit too small.",2
58048,"I did not like these shorts. They are almost cute, but are so stiff and uncomfortable. There is a lot of fabric in the crotch area that is very bulgy and can sometimes give you a camel toe. The back is really cute and flattering but the front is so uncomfortable I had to return them. They also don’t even go to your belly button so they are not very high waisted.",2
46172,Definitely pay attention to the other reviews as I did not. They are really small.,2
54227,"I purchased this stick in 2018 . Its a decent selfie stick which is pretty useful when you are travelling alone or with family. You can built in in Tripod and hence , you don't need to request other people everytime you want a good complete non-selfie picture. The only complaint I have with this is its very fragile and the top of the stick where the iPhone ( or any other phone) needs to be fixed is broken. You need to handle it carefully but with this price the product should be more resistant and durable enough to run minimum for 2 years. Not quite happy.",2
68850,"i was on vacation when this was delivered, and despite the dog sitter takin the package inside, i guess the poor lil rat sat outside on my doorstep way too long cause by the time i got back, it was a melted blob in the packaging,, this is more my fault than anything else. it still tasted good, but it wasn't the rat i wanted. i wish i could have another one sent for free but that ain't how it works. maybe some other day, lil buddy,,,",2

54947,"I wish they would translate the size for the US, got a pair hoping I made them too big- still super small.",2
65882,These are decent shelves if you want to store cereal boxes or other very light weight items. If you plan on storing more than 3-5 lbs one of the top two shelves you will want to go with something more sturdy. The seller lists the storage weight as 50 lbs per shelf. This is grossly overstated. I placed a 10 lb object on the top shelf and the entire shelf almost fell over. The plastic construction of the shelves is mediocre at best.,2
77957,"The product smells so bad of mold that it is unusable! Which is disappointing since it is very cute. It does look like it would fall apart after everyday use though. Going to try to get ride of the smell somehow, fingers crossed it goes away but no luck yet. Very disappointed.",2
62327,Received the product today unfortunately it was damaged,2
68834,the cushion on this seat is cheaply made and not comfortable. I also had this delivered without two of the plastic covers for the bottom of the legs.,2
59451,"It can't handle really tight lids or jars that flare just below the rim. It works fine on jars that I can open without it so it helps my wife with those. Also, the action is (by design) unstoppable until it runs it's course. There's no ""stop now, darn it"" release and reset. It was kind of scary watching it try to grip the jar and then gradually twisting itself off. We were worried it would break the glass. Anyway, we'll keep it.",2
79867,Wouldn’t even bother with them. They run too small by 2 sizes for some people.,2
58985,"I bought the black, white, grey 3 pack in an XL, the same size I wear in normal shirts. The tops are opaque, flowy, and a nice length. Unfortunately the armholes are huge and leave my side exposed from my underarm to my waist. Really disappointed in these, because nowhere did the product images (or reviewer photos!) show this, and if the arm holes were smaller the tops would be perfect.",2
59295,Works for wii u but not pc,2
52138,There is an angled plug that goes into the computer AND there is another cable that plugs into that. That secondary plug does not fit very snugly. I pick up my laptop and put on my lap - then it often comes apart. My original ac adapter was one piece - so it never came apart.,2

74300,"All of these lashes are very shiny, stiff and straight. I double them up for a fuller look. These are good lashes for photos or stage, but in person and close-up they can look cheap. Overall- you can curl and mix/match or double up with these to improve flaws but it takes some time and work. Nice to have these around but I’m still going to splurge on my ardell 3D lashes!",2

75484,Fast shipping. Outside box was in perfect shape but the actual poptarts box inside was crushed and so were all the poptarts. So the damage to poptarts must have occurred before shipping. Very disappointed.,2
53299,"Far too much wiggle room, it has the cut out for the notch but there is too much room for error length wise. I'd take a pic but it's on my phone...just trust me on this one",2
61167,"while I like the idea of a longer cord that won't tangle, the charger itself is marketed as a FAST USB charger. That couldn't be further from the truth. It is no different in speed than any other standard charger. I specifically purchased this as I have a Galaxy S8 Plus and this is highlighted for such. Again, I would not have purchased this particular one, had I known it would not charge my phone any faster than a standard.",2
65560,"Was looking for a new series and thought I'd give this one a go. However, there's too much pointless narration, implausible actions, and mangled syntax for me to keep going. Had to put it down at ""save the world!"" Two stars may even be one too many.",2

45949,"I am a huge fan of the regular soft picks they make. Found these to be too big, too thick and a waste of plastic. Yes, they're solid -- but I keep them close to my desk and if by mistake I leave one on my desk I'd be horrified if someone saw it. I much prefer the other ones as they are small, easy to hide, thin and I don't feel guilty throwing them out after a few hours.",2
72645,Material is nice. Sizes are way off. Ordered a 2x and it might as well be a large.,2
60118,I would have rated this 5 star but the power adapter that came has been stripped (see photo) and I’m not sure if this is good. I’m worried about fire hazard. I’ve emailed the seller or manufacturer if they can send a replacement but never got a response. Returning this item and most probably buy from a different brand.,2

75110,"Looked forward to giving this to my boyfriend for his birthday. He opened it today and we noticed there’s what appears to be some kind of burn marks on the knurling. $100 for a barbell is a great price especially considering how much weight this holds but I’m disappointed it came like that. Had it been some dings to the actual metal I’d just write it off but I’d like to be able to keep the knurling in tact for as long as possible, not damaged right out of the box. 2 stars.. I’ve reached out to them hopefully they make it right.",2

45145,Its more like 8ft not 50ft,2
70893,"Pros: Its beautiful. It fits perfectly in the space I intended it for. It is exactly what I wanted in a vanity. The drawer space is perfect for my makeup. Cons: It was scratched upon arrival. Very upsetting, especially since it is right on the top, and can not be hidden. Also there were wrong parts, that would not allow proper assembly. I should have considered the other reviews, because this seems to be a problem with this product. Pick a different company, or vanity. One that will not arrive beaten up.",2

I have had an issue 5 times now where the phone falls from a reasonable height onto its side and the rotating vibrate switch gets stuck down and won't turn anymore. I have had to request a replacement from customer service 5 times now. They have sent one each time, but its very inconvenient to go with out a phone case and to have to reach out for a replacement. Customer service also claims the issue is uncommon. I don't buy that, but I guess I understand why they wouldn't admit it.",2

74148,USB - C power is weak. Cannot charge laptop (tried a few). I understand it is not a full fledged laptop charger but it is really low power.

These bottles originally worked as expected, but over the past couple months have become completely unreliable.

I could see if it happened to just one, so we discontinued the leaky one, and the next one had the same issue about two months in .

78085,"These are adorable, no doubt. They look GREAT. However, for me they just didn't work. They are stuck to the back of the phone / phone case with an adhesive. I thought this adhesive would be strong, but it wasn't strong enough. The metal ring is supposed to be able to turn all the way around for different positioning. It was SO hard to turn that the entire thing popped off of my phone very time I tried to turn it. I can't use it if I can't turn it, and I can't turn it if it won't stay stuck to my phone. Sent back for a refund. Kind of disappointed, because like I said, they were really cute.",2
56334,"I love how these look and they are nice and thick; unfortunately, the condensation is not absorbed. It made the glass stick to the coaster several times. I was able to catch it the first few times, but on the last one, when I lifted the glass, the coaster was attached and then fell to the ground and cracked.",2

73040,The two largest issues that I have with this screen protector is the clarity and the loss of screen sensitivity. The center film piece is protected on both sides by clear plastic for a simple enough install. The center piece is blue and degrades the screen quality unless put on full screen brightness. It is not clear like the example pictures show. The screen also deteriorates a large portion of touch sensitivity from your fingers.,2

46459,"They were not expensive, and you get what you pay for. Two of these clips broke the first week I used them! Cute, colorful, but they didn't hold up for me. Maybe in some situation where they would get less strenuous use. Would not order again.",2

40763,I returned it. The first batch burned and the burnt smell wouldn't wash out of the item. I couldn't store it in my cupboard without having that smell permeate.,2
71330,"I used this to protect the wall from the hanging swiffer wet jet , broom, mops, dusters. It’s nice and thick and definitely clear but I put it on a little bit crooked the first time and it did pull the paint off the wall when I removed it to re-adjust. Thankfully this is in the closet. I would be hesitant to use it on my front door or anywhere the paint could be obviously ruined.",2
75986,"Well... I’ve had this vacuum for exactly a year. I loved it at first... but then... after a few months it started just cleaning on its own at midnight every night. I checked all my settings and timers. Tried to clear the issue. Nothing. Tried to contact the company... very difficult to get ahold of anyone. I think I emailed them, and then maybe a month later, someone emailed me back with no resolve to my issue. I gave up. Figured... fine, ok... I’ll just let it clean at midnight every night. Which was ok as long as it didn’t get stuck under something. I’d much rather it clean while I was around so I can clear any jams or get it unstuck from under furniture, etc... But NOW... the thing has just gone haywire. I can no longer get it to connect to my app on my phone, it doesn’t work from the remote that it came with... so when I turn it on and let it run, it just stops in the middle of my floor beeping and screaming at me for no reason. Here goes trying to contact customer service again... (insert eye roll)... there is now a number to contact them, but I just get a message stating that there is no one available and to leave a message. I left a message. But, I don’t know about you, but my time is very valuable to me. I work full time, single parent to an active, athletic kid in a lot of sports. I’m never home. So... I’m interested to see if and when they can get back to me. How convenient. In the meantime, I’m writing this review and shopping for a new vacuum. Certainly from a different company. Will not purchase from this company again.",2

46799,"I had been wearing Hanes briefs for years. Like other reviewers have stated, Hanes quality has recently gone down. I figured I would give these briefs a try since they had so many positive reviews. When I opened the package, the fabric felt divine. I took off the tags and washed all of the briefs. The first day of wearing them can only be described as wedgie city. As soon as I started walking, they would ride up. If I bent over, they would go even further up. Throughout the day, I continually had to pull them out of my ###. I couldn't wait to get home from work and get these off and go back to cotton. I contacted the company and explained my situation. They stated that since I used a pair and washed all of the others, they could not resell them. They offered me a 30% refund. I took their offer but I am not sure if this is a fair deal. On one hand, they are a small company and are not in business to lose money. On the other hand, on the selling page, they state the following: ""Smart No-wedgie Design Improved One-piece clean cut overall enables the ultimate underwear being no wedgies in the back to avoid embarrassed adjustment."" If they are stating that they have a no wedgie design, and I got a wedgie as do many other reviewers (just look at the 1 and 2 star reviews), the product description is not accurate. Update: The company contacted me and offered a free package of bamboo underwear with another cut. When I declined their offer, the offered me a free package with another fabric. I declined their second offer as well, but I appreciated their efforts.",2
45078,"They both came with dents/bends in the bottom. This has made all the pages bent at the bottom and it's really irritating. I was so excited to get these and now I'm just disappointed. I haven't tried the paper out yet. Once I do I'll update my review, but I might not even be able to use these; too irritating to have those bends in each page. EDIT: I had decided to stick with it as the paper is thick enough and nice for writing, but I ran into a problem that has made this journal unusable for me. I've added more pictures to show that the dot grid doesn't line up from page to page. It isn't this way on all pages, but it happened on one that I was using the entire two pages for a spread so it really screwed me up. I'm getting a different brand.",2

78049,"It takes TOO long (HOURS) to hatch the egg and to wake up from naps that it make almost impossible to play with it after school or after summer camp hours before time to sleep of my kid. Before it hatch or wake up, you can’t play nothing with the tamagotchi. Also, it needs more brightness. It’s too difficult to look at the tamagotchi and the small icons. Also the buttons are too small to hit. Too pricey for the same old tamagotchi. The only nice thing is that it is a toy from my childhood but it doesn’t worth for the price.",2

Already ordered 3 other cases from another supplier I’ve ordered from in the past & their leather is top quality & cheaper. This one did come in a nice well made box. Maybe they should of spent more on product quality. I feel I paid for the box, as this was $5 more than previous cases I’ve purchased.
