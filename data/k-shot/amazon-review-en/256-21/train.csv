127855,Makes greAt coffee but coffeemaker does not allow your hand to get into that coffee pot to clean it; therefore coffee residue stays in bottom of pot. I like the attachment that removes chlorine from the Warne. Auto brew timer is a great feature.,4
152307,It's everything it says it is.... Works perfect for us!!!!,4
120267,"Well in the picture it says it has 2 vibrators when it really has only one. Other than that it's light and very versatile, I use it for my herniated disc and my epicondylitis and it's great that it's wireless cos I can take it with me to trips and restaurants and stuff. I just think the publicity has to be more accurate. It wouldn't hurt if it really had 2 vibrating points, and better yet, that not only the middle part vibrated but all 3 sections we're functional. Just an idea for Homedics.",4
130126,I like this book. Glad Rebecca and Alex realized that they love one another. Sad that Heather had such hate for Rebecca that she would hurt people,4
156282,This pot is on point. Very good. No sticking.very easy to clean and cooks perfectly fine,4
133660,"These fit well and are very comfortable but are rather frail. Best hand washed or, as last resort, washed on delicate/cold water in the washing machine. Do not dry in the clothes drier if that can be avoided.",4
157316,"Not really a blue light at night, more like a yellow white light. Still, it's better than nothing.",4
141204,"I was skeptical but my better half ordered two of these. We made use of the suggestions from other people who bought these and gave them a good review. Very sturdy. We put them together with the addition of gorilla glue on the pegs. We assembled them and let them sit overnight to let the adhesives dry and do their job. The cranky comments from people who didn't follow the instructions, moving the item right after assembly, not assembling them properly, etc. are tiresome. This is not heirloom furniture but it does the job if you put it together properly.",4
153551,Love the look of this costume. My daughter loves it - good for twirling! :) Only complain is cheapness of accessories - the gems on the wand fell off after 5 minutes of trying it on. Hopefully we can glue them back on.,4
153131,It is beautiful but it slide off the table a lot.,4
141379,Basement humidity is much better using this,4
147747,My daughter got this book for Christmas. It is great to be given so many ideas of things to draw. I just wish there was some sort of instruction or a picture to copy. It is literally an empty book.,4
144727,"Nice looking, appears to be well-made. Not as lightweight as I would have hoped, but perhaps it can't serve its purpose at a light weight. The tightening screws, handles, etc., are sturdy, and legs are stable. Will work well.",4
136619,"But the metal join on one side has a small snag. It isn't enough to stop me from using them, but it is noticeable as I knit. Otherwise they're great, and I like the finish on the needles--not so slick my work slides off but smooth.",4
140855,"Thought that I would stand upright for the most part, but it kind of folds over when it is full. It is durable and lightweight for taking to the laundromat",4
128778,"as advertised, loved it",4
128391,This game is a lot of fun.,4
148765,I also bought the solar ones--love it. My advice is to get the solar and not worry about batteries,4
150547,As noted in at least one other review product arrived with no top. When I have purchased this product in a pet store it has always had a top on it. This is my favorite aroma of the other colognes in this product line; last only a day or so which is disappointing.,4
124668,Love it and results!! Only thing is it was pretty messy,4
137341,Bras are very comfortable. Perfect for breastfeeding.,4
137402,"Fast-paced romance with a little magic thrown in for good measure. Not an intensely deep story, but still a fun read.",4
155376,My dog loves these treats. Just wish they were a little less expensive.,4
120130,I love these glasses. Very good quality and they look great on me. I'm happy.,4
131492,"The window of time to return this product was one month. Although the product broke one week after that return window closed, the merchant was very responsive and was able to rectify the situation by replacing the product. I’m very impressed with their professionalism and responsiveness to the matter. They are definitely customer oriented.",4
159639,"They're a little looser than I was expecting but I think I'm just in between sizes (xs and small). Overall, length is great.",4
138131,"Loving it so far, although I do feel the suction isn’t perfect but enough to do the job.",4
131197,"The bottles says to take one, three times a day. I take one a day and lets just say that has been plenty.",4
120335,Very cute! Fits the note 9 well.,4
129935,As advertised though heavy and need larger bite.,4
136014,"Almost as I expected, the picture on the case is faded and not as clear as I would've liked.",4
123297,This movie was funny however some parts didnt play well,4
155661,"Using this in my work computer for meetings instead of those ugly and uncomfortable headsets with the arm mic. The sound quality is very good, both hearing and speaking (with the mic)",4
125507,"Great material, I have washed it twice with no problems and no wrinkles.",4
138976,Is good quality for a great price.,4
140632,"Sleeve offers great compression, really helps my tendonitis. Gave 4 stars because the copper healthy emblem and print started wearing off on 2nd days and looked really bad. After a few days was worn enough to peel the rest. Other than that I highly recommend.",4
147442,Great item. Price is right! Just exactly what I needed!!! Super cute,4
130874,Adult wipes. Larger than those purchased in 99 cent store,4
139913,Was pretty good and solid. The phone didn't work out for me so replaced it.,4
126197,Top is a little big while bottoms are a little small but still super cute.,4
141460,"Beautiful dress, just did not fit",4
151287,"I got a defective unit, but manufacturer was quick to replace it! Great for charging my Apple Watch on the go.",4
144299,"How can I replace LED, I bought this item and the light only worked for about 2 month?",4
152763,The controller functions well overall. the only negatives are that the dpad is nearly unusable and that the rubber pad on the left stick wears over time.,4
148564,"I think these are a great value if you are looking for something cute. You get a variety of cute patterns for a fantastic price, and I definitely think they are worth buying. They are made out of a soft knit cotton t-shirt like material which is just what I wanted. Just know if you want to use these to workout or just casually wear them for a long time that you may have to readjust them as they like to slip back and then off in those instances, at least on my hair which is really sleek. I also have a medium-large head so that probably plays a part. It's definitely not a deal-breaker and I am sure once I wear them more they will stretch out a bit.",4
122279,I like the magnetic capability. I wish the product came in colors. I will have to paint it and hope that it will still be durable.,4
133981,"Kind of expensive for boxes but they are good quality and shipped faster than expected. There aren’t a lot of options in this size, I recommend these!",4
140536,For indoor use only . Gravel collects around foot too much to be useful outdoors in the Desert. Insole becomes a little sticky after a few hours. Wool insole lining would be better.,4
120299,has all that is needed,4
120440,"Likes: great design, well built. Dislike: I have a tendency to want to lean slightly on the table but am afraid to with the 20 pound capacity.",4
136634,Had hubby install this weekend. Now both sides of garage roof are set to collect rain water this afternoon.,4
138637,Yes the price is steep for a print - but it is the perfect addition to our apartment.,4
155686,Good thickness to the pages but the coloring pages aren't very interesting.,4
130060,"It was cool for about 2 minutes, and then I just didn't see the draw to these. Also, if you have a wireless charger, they tend to get in the way. My wife uses them still, well, until I bought her a new case she can't use them on.",4
154537,It was a gift for my husband. He likes the color and it's very nice. Magnet isn't very strong but it holds about 10-12 bills,4
158117,"I love the ideal of stretchable lids. It goes well on pyrex glass boxes. Just make sure it is of perfect size. dishwasher safe. Do not leak but don't store liquid in container and then hope it to replace your lid. About the zip seal bags, they are ok not that great but fact that it is re-usable I have lot of use cases for organizing my fridge with them.",4
130784,"Looks nice and is good sized. However, the holder for the wipes has already ripped after 2 months of use and when you put a small stack of wipes, it does not close. The closing strap needs to be long and the magnet needs to be stronger.",4
143442,It only worked for about 3 months and stopped working,4
124522,A bit large for a size 8. But it shines so nice!! Looks great. It’s a tad brighter and lighter than my real diamonds but perhaps with wear it’ll settle in. Looks great with my real diamonds! Love it.,4
158467,"I’m 5’5 and bought a Large. Pros: the price, lightweight fabric, very breathable. Cons: top is pretty thin shows bra, stripes are more like a bright red, and the sleeve length is a little too long for me. Mine did come with the belt and pockets.",4
151715,"My end table is metal, so the magnet works great, especially when my wife goes to sleep and I have to turn off my bedside lamp. Yet to be used for work projects.",4
125100,We got these for our living room table. They go well with our decor and they are great for the price (added bonus that it comes with a holder). Bottomline - they do the job while looking great,4
140771,"This rug pad is a good value for the money. Product was as represented and advertised. I would order a thicker size next time--but that was my issue, I got what I ordered and recommend.",4
155054,"There are pros and cons to this product. Pros: it works well; I can see my kids while they sleep; the monitor let's me know when it needs to charge; I like that there is a music button, with the VOX setting, the screen turns off when kids are quiet which preserves battery life; it gives us the option to mount to the wall with 2 holes on the back; it does not connect to WiFi which prevents hackers, so keeps my kids safe; it has volume controls and I can talk to my kids through the monitor which is great when I see them doing something they should not; the monitor for my kids room can twist different ways which is great when mounting. Cons: the screen is small; picture quality is not so great; because of the piece that stands the parent up and the charging cable, it can be awkward to stand up; the volume is not very loud; even though it's given the option to mount, no screws come with it to mount; the speaker control is not great and sometimes my kids can't hear me through it; it only sometimes beeps when the kids monitor gets unplugged. I've given it a 4 because for the most part it does it's job and it's good for what I need it for and that is to be a second monitor to the one of a different brand that I already have. It's not as good as my other one, but it works.",4
122265,Super cute! Just a little smaller than I thought.,4
151095,"I bought these because I needed to keep the moisture down in a few rooms. Mold tends to grow. So far, they are absorbing the moisture and I haven’t seen any mold. I do not smell any of the lavender vanilla scent, but it serves its main purpose.",4
139497,These require that you add your own lead wires; they don't have a square pin on the back like some others.,4
139682,Don't bother with the overpriced stock filters. These are just as good and half the price. I couldn't be happier.,4
130688,"The stylus worked great for a few days. However, now when I try to use it, it does not work. I've only had it for about a week now, and I've only used it about 3 times during school. The buttons on the stylus also do not work. I do see that sometimes the stylus will work for a few seconds while I have my palm rested on the iPad but it stops working once I take my palm off. This only lasts for a few seconds even while keeping my palm on the screen. It also will not connect to my iPad anymore. The stylus is not recognized anymore when I try to pair it to my iPad. It was such a great product at first, so I don't see how it is not working anymore. Update: I contacted the seller regarding a refund and I was granted one with no hassle. I’ve had the new one for months now and it works great!",4
139942,"Not had to put it together, took me an hr, it blends well in my baby’s room",4
151488,"It's really outstanding book. Comparing this book with other book it will be foolish, because you can find the exact information in this book, I'm pretty sure that you will not find any book like this one , It will be very difficult. I highly recommend this book.",4
128998,"the taste is very sweet! the sizing is a bit smaller than expected, but it’s still pretty decent! i would recommend it to anyone who loves honeycomb! 8/10 !",4
140066,I 'd like to see the sides a little higher. We use it to play Canasta.,4
129009,"These diapers are adorable, and are a great price compared to others. After doing some research, these have been highly rated for durability. I unfortunately have not had the chance to use these yet, as they are way to big for my 7 lb newborn. We are using disposable diapers until he can fit in these, which is a little disappointing as we were hoping to avoid disposables this time around, but it's not the end of the world. I have given this 4 stars because I haven't been able to actually try them out due to the fact they do not fit newborns as advertised. Due to the size of these diapers, I anticipate we won't get to use them for at least another few months. I will update my review when we get a chance to use them.",4
127478,Item was canceled never received need credit,4
142418,"These were a little heavier than I expected but, the kids seemed to enjoy!",4
141963,This book contained many cliches pertaining to black people. All in all that didn't overpower the valuable resources given out throughout the book .,4
147697,Liked the size and that the battery life is pretty good.,4
129708,Engaging fleshed out characters. An enjoyable book for a romance. Head and shoulders above other writers in the romance genre.,4
121967,"I buy this tea for my father-in-law who is more of a coffee drinker and isn't fussy about tea. I personally find it fairly harsh and not a soothing beverage. Organic teas that cost more tend to have a better flavor and go down better, even black. Still for the price, it's not bad.",4
152699,"This dress fits well, have to size down tho.",4
147256,"Just want to thank the seller for thier great costumer service..had an issue with battery not staying changed,contacted seller and they send me replacement battery right way...so now laptop seems its working as it should. So super duper happy with the purchases...thanks",4
132762,"When I purchased this I didn’t see the disclaimer about it not fitting some coffee makers. I have a Bunn and the filter is too small. However, I decided to try it anyway and so far it’s working just fine. I hardly ever make a full pot, so the grounds don’t over flow and there is very little sediment in the bottom of the pot. I’m satisfied.",4
156161,Good product. Easy installation. Just what we needed.,4
132246,"Great style, like the fit - only drawback is the fasteners - they come apart",4
137271,be sides the colour the jacket was all I wanted,4
156859,It relatively easy to replace and seems to be working out. I will keep you posted on the durability.,4
155155,"Works well, but you need to figure out the correct flow rate. Test these out prior to your trip for best results.",4
152795,Very good Requires minimum effort . Used only once but I’m pleased with my purchase,4
155261,Good shirt but shrinks an entire size.,4
139838,"Good One, but not his best. Make it a great one Stone wins the day with Lances help Happy reading",4
142413,"Wasn't that bad to put together, just took a bit of time. One board did come without a few of the main holes drilled though. In the end it's a decent table and gets used quite a bit.",4
136834,The smell of the wood or maybe the paint don’t go away.,4
136853,Haven't dropped my computer so can't tell you how good it works..,4
121247,"This is a sturdy ball, however, the 55"" is not good office seating. I am 5'2"" and at my desk while sitting on the ball, my chin is just above my standard desk. Going back.",4
136816,Very nice item are use it all the time,4
135006,Perfect for around the house. Must wear with thick socks tho because they feel like tiny needles without socks.,4
155525,Great product with fast delivery!,4
142571,Using to feed a beta with the small round beta pellets. Tested it out before installing on the tank. Works good on 24 and 12 hour feeding. Pellet food is very small and it was a little tricky to adjust food release. Instructions are in Chinese none in English. If I didn’t have something like this before I would have been in trouble. It is still new so we will have to see how it performs in future,4
141875,This is the second set of these I've had..and the motor has quit in one of them each time. Guess I will have to send these back too. So disappointed. Edited to add: I am going to change this to a 4 star as the seller has contacted me with an offer of a refund and replacement product. This kind of offer goes a long way with me and hopefully the new set works well.,4
158053,"This is to replace a similar product which I lost, and it appears to be equally waterproof.Tried the leak test seems to look good slight condensation around the edge at the top but I'm sure that will be ok as tissue inside was bone dry.Using for a holiday looks sturdy thanks.Tested these whilst in the garden pool and they worked brilliantly..",4
127951,Love it! Looks great and holds flower pot well just wish they had a little more room between bottom and top shelves.,4
147202,A long book but reads quickly. Writing is clear. Naval action tied to its effect on and participation in the land war. A good introduction to the naval history of the era. More photos would have welcome. Maps are clear but in tiny print in this edition. An accompanying atlas of WWII naval battles would help the reader understand maneuvers and strategy. Recommended.,4
129306,Great case trust my purchase with it.,4
138013,This was suppose to be a skull and it was wolves.,4
149785,"Small and practical, lovely shape. Simple and convenient operation.",4

142242,My son who is 11 likes it. Feels a lil bit cheap but for my son works just great. Queen size,4
150154,"The quality and concept of this product is excellent. So much better than the dial ones, cleaner and less awkward to use. The only difficulty I have is the length the bar extends can be a little can be dangerous when doing skull crushers.",4
136314,Great quality for the price. Works well with any action cam that has a tripod mount,4
123222,"These socks provide great compression. They do the job and my feet/legs feel great after the end of a 12hr shift. They are thick near the foot which provides great cushion. I have 2 complaints. 1) the foot/toe part of the socks are very wide. Which can make it difficult to fit into well-fitting tennis shoes. 2) The band are the top can be very tight. I end up having to roll it down by the ned of the day. Overall, great compression. Wide toes. Thick sock with cushion",4
150876,Product has potential to be a five star product. The only issue was the stitching along the main zipper started coming off immediately after the first use. Overall satisfied.,4
145700,"The ""but"" here is because I should have ordered the wider banded one made by the same excellent company. The thin band put a little too much pressure on my waist. I love this company, though. I own about 5 different leggings that they make.",4
158177,"Great fit on my shower door. Easy to install once I figured out the proper arrangement of adapters, gasket and screws. Could have included instructions to make it easier but not to difficult with some understanding of how the opening needs to seal.",4
125524,"Very easy to install. It is reversible, so you get much longer useful life.",4
130038,Portable little recorder and works as it's expected. Buttons make it easier to operate than just menu options like some other models.,4
131592,This bag looks amazing....my daughter loves it! The problem I've had with it is the neoprene bags do not work well to keep a cold temperature. Every day her large ice pack is melted and everything in the bag is at room temp.,4
154504,"loose on my small 250cc honda rebel. but the included buckle straps are a HUGE plus to make sure it doesn't get blown off the bike in the wind! I used to need to wrap a large bungee cord around the bike in a couple spots to keep my covers from being blown off the bike, specially in storms, this one has held strong for a couple weeks now without any current signs of breaking. this is a CHEAP cover however, don't hold high expectations for longevity of the cover. it's not super thick and will break if continued to be used as I am currently using it!",4
154261,"This works well to help organize cosmetics and jewelry, particularly given limited storage space in the bathroom. It appears to be well made and is easy to stack, although the drawers can be a tad sticky. I am using the bottom three tiers on my dresser, to store jewelry, and the top levels in the bathroom, to store cosmetics. I like the versatility that you can separate the pieces and stack them as necessary Why four stars instead of five? I wish it were a little larger, and I wish that there were deeper compartments on the top for storing brushes and pencil eye and lip liners.",4
138653,"The antennas work good, once you get them installed and set up your TV to scan channels the video is good. Depending where you have it set up, the picture quality and/or channel availability will have an impact on what is available for reception. By extending them to the maximum height or on/by the windows is even better for viewing your maximum channels that are available in your area. Does the job and the price is good as well.",4
127123,Good seller. Would do business with again.,4
146245,I love the diamond picture. Some of the symbols are really hard to make out( an example is a white symbol on a light gray background). There are 3 different ones in this picture. I am having to use a magnifying glass. Plus all the colors are really close in color. It is going to be spectacular..I was short some beads in one color and the seller was very quick to respond.,4
134130,"What I really enjoy about this duvet cover is how soft the material is and the comfort you get when you touch it. I've had some duvet covers that are simply not good, they are all crunchy and sleeping under them is a nightmare. This one also comes with matching pillow cases and I really like how you can tie the duvet down to the corners.",4
125766,Great lock but stopped working suddenly. The company replaced it with express delivery.,4
142656,Soo cute works well love the color,4
121795,This is a slick little display that works just fine.,4
126566,"The bag is cute, has average quality...it is small. I actually gave it to my niece. If you like smaller bags or clutches then this is for you. It was not for me, I need more space. Better yet, you can use it for a date night cute little makeup and phone bag.",4
156259,"My duck feet waddle off to the side, but that is probably more of a personal problem. Solid construction and definitely true to size.",4
148861,"works well, would be better with on/off switch.",4
143454,"The installation was simple and straight to the point. Putting your head under there to reach was a bit hard. If you had problems like me, a hack and pliers made it easy. My issue was that the new side markers needed a bit of force to stretch the wiring harness so that the side marker clip can lock in (the clip on the right, the closest one with the led wire+plug).",4
123753,"Wanted to buy one of the new fancy dish drainers. As if it would make washing dishes more fun! None of them fit in one side of my divided sink. Funny, but I had never thought of my sink as small. Gave up my dream of fun dishwashing and bought this drainer of old reliable design. It fits and works perfectly. Some times tried and true things are best. Only thing I would change is having glass holders incorporated into sides to keep mugs and glasses from rolling over or taking too much space.",4
152328,It’s a cute band but you have to tie it a couple times real tight because it will get loose. But other than that it’s nice. I have the black and white one.,4
150727,"Lightweight, sturdy and almost comfortable. Great buy!",4
146241,Item was as advertised and arrived in a timely manner. Thanks!,4
132893,Quality seems ok. Nothing special. No eco-drive. Bought it for my wife. She is satified with it,4
125923,"The kit was handy to get, but the fan and heat sink are too small for the Peltier device - wish it was maybe 25% larger to cool the hot side down more. Unknown water cooling block configuration internally - would have been good to know the type: posts, fins, or what.",4
134289,My 2 year old son loves shapes right now so I got this. He likes the pieces and naming them and they liked putting them in the house. Bad things about it is the door to get the shapes back open my kids couldn’t figure out easily how to open it which it is hard to open and then it easily breaks from the hinges. The door is now broke somewhere.,4
146032,"I wasn't taught sewing so I got this as a ""learn to use"" and I am glad I got it. I also bought it to sew my bfs work pants as they continue to fall apart! The instructions were hard to understand so I googled a ""how to"" mini sewing machine video and that was helpful.",4
140638,Lovely caddy bag. It’s a must kind of caddy for every parent with lil ones,4
121829,I bought two pairs of these. One as a gift the other for myself. The receiver of the gifted pair has used lock laces before so they liked. I had a more of an adjustment period of trying to figure out tight or lose to make them on my shoes and still be comfortable.,4
148273,Nice fabric. Left a lot of blue fuzz on my floors with first use. I’d suggest washing before using.,4
120194,This hand exerciser is just what I needed since slightly injuring the muscles in my hand . Just by squeezing the metal coil I can feel it helping to flex that muscle. It's like instant therapy.,4
138609,"The product was a gift for my mother. She was really very thankful and glad with the product. My father was the one that installed the faucet and said that seems very good, related to quality, but does not comes with the installation instructions. At least he had experience on this kind of installation and was able to put all as was supposed to be. He said that the installation was easy and the type of construction can be more resistant to the mold than others.",4
131799,"I have very thick/big hair, so a hair stylist friend recommend these. Pretty cool! Lots of options! Even works well in really smooth/thin hair. Loses one star because one broke after about 10 uses.",4
149065,"Good book!Easy directions and makes the best ribs, chicken, smoked sausage. All the recipes are very healthy and delicious. Recommended !",4
140706,Great bat grip that lasts. We bought this grip a year ago and it is still going strong. My son takes about 100 swings a day at least 4 days a week and it has held up great.,4
147473,Awesome game. Very addicting.,4
135917,"Great product. Be sure to order a size up. The length was mid thigh for me. I normally wear a small in this style dress, but I should have ordered a M. A little too tight for me, but it was not see through.",4
127731,"Wonderful product, easy to use and worth the money.",4

Here it is: I love how the tracker fits because it's not uncomfortable at all. I also like the colors because it's not over the top. I bought the black and blue one. It tracks everything and even gives you message notifications like phone calls and text messages but, you only see the messages once and it's gone after you tap on it and read it and if your phone is connected to the device and in close range. My only flaw really is that the battery life doesn't last for more than 2.5 days and then it'll need charged up again. The distance is in km not miles. If anything changes, I'll let you know.",4

I am not the biggest fan of the scents of the candles as they are very strong but they function exactly as described which is great. I'm not sure that there is a way for them to function with a less strong scent. I will probably keep they closed and just as cute shelf pieces instead of burning them very frequently. I would definitely give these candles to someone with a pet as a gift. They are wrapped very nicely and look very professional.,4

The two included remotes already have batteries installed. So, you'll need 18 AAA batteries which cost roughly $15 USD to purchase.

158503,I got these for my mom who likes to watch TV before bed but always complains she doesn't sleep well. I'm hoping they help. I tried them on myself. They are comfortable and stylish and do a good job of blocking the blue light. She says they are comfortable on her nose which is a big deal because it is her biggest complaint against wearing any glasses.,4
124972,I like these little things because they're small and cute and I work in vineyards so it feels personal but they aren't perfect. if you stick the bottom point into the crease of the book hoping that it will sort of wedge itself in there and stand upright it just falls over. basically the rubber is a little too thick so it doesn't tightly wedge in there but I mean it's a place holder so it is what it is. I'd recommend them.,4

136721,"I bought the K2 to give myself additional room for at least one of my kiddos and gear. The seat is basically useless as the back has zero rigidity. I sat on the seat and just let the back side flip down to give myself and extra long seat for shifting around. The legroom is great for me at 5’2” and probably will be suitable for up to an average height man or woman. The kayak itself sit very well made and inflates/deflates within minutes. I used an electric pump so much quicker. It definitely will take a little longer with the manual pump that comes with it but should still be reasonable. The only issue Ive noticed is the the bottom portion tends to lose air. I noticed on both trips after coming out of the water, the bottom had deflated just slightly. So I would recommend taking the manual pump with you for longer trips in the water just to be safe. This is the only reason I’m giving just 4 stars. Overall, I’m very happy with this kayak. I’m new to kayaking and this is a great one for beginners or leisurely paddles around the lake.",4
150265,"At first this product didn't seem appealing at all. It feels very greasy when you put it on your skin and it does not smell good.

I am looking forward to using it for DIY projects. This product doesn't give off the best first impression but it really does work as a moisturizer.

126331,I usually don’t write reviews but felt the need to share my opinion on this one. My 6 year old broke his elbow requiring pins and a full arm cast a week before spring break. We wanted at least one beach day... even if it was just playing in the sand and not the water. I purchased this product but was really nervous at first telling my son to not submerge his arm completely under the water- well he listened like any typical 6 year old. With in 5 minutes he was swimming with the fish. I checked it right away and his cast was completely dry. Very pleased with this purchase! The only thing I didn’t like was how hard it was to put on but if you follow the directions (like I did the second time) it wasn’t bad at all. He didn’t complain of it being too tight on his arm either. Great product!,4
145475,"This cat tree is really pretty and fits well in my one bedroom apartment. It was a bit of a headache to put together (but I guess that's a bit to be expected). My cat is a bit uninterested in it right now, but I suspect that before long she'll discover it (hah hah I think she's a bit fearful of it). I have a small 1 year old cat (probably not fully grown, maybe 10 lbs?? idk). It seems large enough for her, though the small pad on the side that she could theoretically use as a step to the next level looks like it might be too small (but maybe she'll figure out how to use it anyway). I can come back and leave more info later when she starts actually playing on the thing. Anyway, it's about what I expected from amazon (because the parts were all there and it didn't seem to be a knock-off of an original product lol). I still can't wrap my head around how expensive these things are given the materials are a bit cheap, but it appears steady enough. The fabric that was used is a nice blue color (exactly as pictured on amazon) and it's very soft. The specific things I would suggesting changing in this model are (1) make the board material a bit heavier/more substantial, (2) wrap the fabric covering all the way around the underside of the boards that are higher up because the top two levels underside can be seen when standing, and (3) make that small ledge a bit larger. Otherwise, the tree seems really great, and I think the cat will enjoy it.",4

146609,Works fine and quite easy to handle. Definitely help the messy chore.,4
124266,"Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this product, except for the fact that I'll have to do some modifications. The fabric super nice and thick, no need to worry about seeing through. I got the red, and it does appear a little bit lighter than the picture when in daylight, but nothing that bothers me too much. I have two very small issues with the dress. The first one is the sleeves have some holes, and they're a little bit too low for my liking, the sleeves are a perfect length for me naturally, and the some holes are a little bit higher up which stretches the fabric. I feel if you had shorter arms, this wouldn't be much of an issue but for me it was since I'm a little bit longer there. My other issues that I'm quite busty, and the corset comes too high up. It comes up about halfway up my bust, so I'm going to remove the top couple fabric eyelets. Overall, this product is perfect if you aren't super tall or busty, but even if you are, they're easy modifications! (Remember to order a size or 2 up!)",4

He felt so bad he didn't even charge me, but he recommended a local watch shop about a mile away. I went there - and he, too, couldn't get the back on the watch. I went to a THIRD watch shop - same story. Then, in desperation, I emailed Timex who said I'd hear from someone within 24 hours - that was almost three days ago. So that's it - I'm done.

Matter of fact it's got a mind of it's own, it reads a pulse of 75 even when I'm not wearing it, but no steps tracking or calories burned. Yes I downloaded the app and it connected and I tested the connection by placing a call through my phone. I played with it for a few hours and not one step was tracked. Needless to say I am returning it and looking for something better",1

25523,The timer was great. Easy to use. It’s not at all waterproof. My daughter washed her hands (like 3s do) and got water on it and it completely died. Bag of rice and it was up and going but off a bit. She washed her hands at preschool and it was done for. Wish we’d paid more attention to waterproof watches - this doesn’t handle water well at all. It wasn’t submerged. It’s a bathroom and it’s going to get wet with little hands learning. Very bummed to lose $20 down the drain.,1

25866,"The Good: Picture quality is good, as is night vision. Both on par with what you would expect. There is a separate base station with it's own storage (via SD card), so no monthly fees to get your data off the cloud. The Bad: Pretty much everything else. The cameras have to be connected to the base station, not your WiFi network, so you can only get so far away from the base station. In my house there is just no way to cover both sides of the house with one base unit. Very frustrating because I already have a mesh WiFi system that covers the whole house and yard. The motion detection is astonishingly bad. It records dozens of little 6 second clips of nothing. I have tinkered with sensitivity, and pointing the camera slightly differently. Nothing works. There is no way to tell what motion is being detected -- most of the time I can't see anything moving. The front door cam is triggered by mystery movements, but ignores people coming to door more than half the time. The ""Activity zone"" feature (which to be fair is marked as beta) seems to have no effect at all. The system allows several different setup scenarios such as home, and away, disabled, etc. There is no way however to have them auto set based on location -- the obvious thing would be to allow my to set away automatically when I leave (or my phone does anyway :)) IFTTT integration would solve this problem, but alas non is provided. I deeply regret purchasing this -- the system is way overpriced for what you get, and what you get is disappointing at any price.",1

The other seems to be ok, but Amazon is refusing to take back the broken compass they sent me. If I had bought this at a brick and mortar store, I would have been able to see that it was broken before I bought it. Not pleased with the compass or Amazon.

17827,Am I supposed to break the plastic grid? Comes with an instruction book that lists a ton of car types but not a jeep wrangler which it said was compatible when I ordered. Looks like it fits if I install it without the radio because there are two plastic X blocking the port. If you buy be sure you have something to cut plastic.,1
83787,The color is nice and I wear it all the time when it's raining. But it's a little too thin for me. It was also a little tight in the chest area.,3
107394,"Outlets are really close together -think about what you want to plug in before buying. I purchased this to plug in 3 cords (not USB). Due to the sizes of the plugs, only 2 would fit and the middle outlet was pretty useless.",3
119023,"I cannot decide if I like them or dislike them... As someone who is fairly comfortable with putting false lashes on with lash glue, I find these extremely difficult to put on. The length of the magnet is fairly short. Once I was able to adhere the magnets, I was shocked at how comfortable they were on. However, because the length of the magnet is so short, the lashes look like they were hanging on for dear life. It's like when you wear false lashes and one of the corners doesn't stay on so you have that lash peeking out. I may have to cut them, but I think they will end up looking like corner lashes instead of full lashes. I think with better practice, this may work out for me BUT it might take more magnetic lashes since you have to be extremely gentle with them or else they start to fray/peel off the band and lose its original form. Also, to clarify, you get 8 pieces but they're only 2 pairs of magnetic lashes (2 pieces for each eye), not 8 pairs of magnetic lashes.",3

115171,"Great product ....while it lasts, which isn’t long. It starts to lose power/strength of vibrations very quickly after first purchasing it and continues to diminish until the product stops working completely. Many speeds that are great and it’s rather strong when it’s operating at its full power capacity. If you’re looking for a quality made product, there are probably better choices but for a (fairly) cheap toy, it works well.",3
104384,The story line was good but not enough love/sex scenes for a romance novel. Maybe I just expect more.,3
95389,I was sent a different shade than I ordered.,3
105667,You might as well just dump this stuff out and replace it with some apple cider vinegar. It doesn't work as well and dries up fast. It will still kill a few here and there but not as fast as the apple cider vinegar on its own. Save your money and get the large bottle at the store and you'll be fine.,3
108393,over all book was in good shape just upset that the dust jacket came damaged but all pages were clear and there,3
107849,Not sure if these run small or if my head is just too big? I ended up giving it away to my little cousin. I really liked the hat. It’s so soft inside BUT it would not stay on my head.,3

114311,"I'm not sure why this was a best-seller. The first couple of chapters seemed lame but I got through them. The remainder of the book never drew me in--it's as though I was just listening to someone tell me their story. Even if you account for ""cultural differences,"" some of this story didn't make sense. It really could have been so much more and I don't understand why this made a best-seller list.",3
112078,"I had an original cube in the 80’s, and I thought it would be fun to play with one again. I didn’t want a fancy speed cube, I was just looking for one like the old toy. This one is smaller than the original, and it doesn’t feel at all the same. I’ll have to keep looking. The little stand is functional but really cheap and flimsy. The logo is only silver on one side, the other two are just molded plastic. I’ll probably just put it in the shelf without the stand.",3

96606,"Said it would fit my door, bur screws were too long, The outside handle did not fit into existing holes. The lock handle did not not fit into existing hole, in this case too much paint. This also caused the lock operation to be very hard.",3
113144,"Frustrating that you can't pull up the barcode from your phone. Who prints things anymore?!!?! The cashier was a little confused, but eventually figured it out.

85307,"I like the device design and colors, but wish the changing color setting changed at a slower, more gradual pace. The device makes a ver faint, but high-pitched hissing noise and gives off an internal blue light when the upper light is turned off. This means I have to hide it under the bed. I wanted it to be a bedside charger, but the noise and light are not conducive to sleep.",3
107112,The order was fine I simply got the wrong size and did a return for the product and have ordered another one. The only thing that upset me is that I am being charged to return the item.,3
95572,worked for a week then quit working. was pretty good for the first week though.,3
101463,Smaller than expected,3
82725,I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because the actual ball entertained the puppy for a bit. The battery life on this thing isnt good. The weasel part came off day one and my Moms dog weighs 3 lbs. Def not a good buy for any dog.,3
108222,The toys were low quality,3
87568,Liked the doing things that you never thought of doing before and getting out of your comfort zone. Might make some people be inspired to do the same.,3

103555,"I wanted to wait a little while before doing a review. First off, it's not Vegan (not a big deal to me, but to some it is very important so just want to point that out). It also is greasy in my eyes, and that greasy coating helps the tattoo pop and become vibrant while it absorbs into the skin. Overall, it's ok.

INstead it was just depressing. I also didn’t really like any of the characters, and the ending of the book felt pretty rushed. The overall pacing was also a bit off. I did like the very end, though. It just felt slightly forced, I guess. The book overall was not great, and I wouldn’t recommend it for people who want fun drama, rather than depressing drama. 2.5 stars.",3

81862,"This little vacuum is a good value. The main attachment is good for cleaning up pet hair or crumbs--there's suction on the top and bottom so it's great to stick in corners or behind couch cushions, etc. I keep it in my car to vacuum the seats and other nooks and crannies. But it's not the best on flat/hard surfaces. It's also not the best at getting dust if you don't attach the hose. The exhaust on the sides it really intense and might blow the dust away before you have a chance to vacuum it up. Also, if you don't empty the canister after every use or keep it upright, the dirt/hair/dust can just fall right out again. Finally, it's very loud. But for the price, it gets the job done and I'm pretty happy with it.",3

93535,I love my pink work gloves. I work construction most days of the week and need some work gloves that will hold up and last. These are not them. The first pair I purchased ripped on the index finger after about 4 months. I figured that was okay because I am so hard on them. I ordered a second pair and they only lasted me about 6 weeks before the index finger ripped again. I need a glove that can handle real work. Doesn’t anyone make a tough pink work glove? I can’t be the only woman construction worker out there that wants pink work gloves!,3

92200,Cute. Wanted to use in my car but pieces do fall out easily,3
100379,"Bought this with the hopes of accessing the water on the side of our apartment. I could only get a quarter turn or less when I tried using this key, so it was useless to me. Now it sits in the drawer as a paper weight.",3
116326,"This was a strange read and just as I was starting to get engrossed in the story it ended, Bummer",3
83936,The quality is ok and expected for this price. The problem are the wings. They came squished and I haven't be able to fix them to look like how they are in the picture on here. I just whish they could find a better way to send the product without deforming it.,3
110863,Seems a little pricey for the size of this plastic cup. You pay the price because it's fortnite,3
95209,The lemon oil in the product kind of overpowers the other ingredients.,3
113361,"The lock itself is perfect for my needs, but the mounting bracket is a true disappointment. I had to tighten the mounting screw on every ride, and it is absolutely annoying. In this price range this problem should to eliminated. Now i have to use an extra velcro strap to fix the wobble and keep the lock in the desired position.",3
90280,cute lights add a nice touch under my 11 X 11 canopy. I used 2 sets. Unfortunately there isn't a timer on the batteries like there is on some battery light sets. I'd like these better if they turned off automatically after several hours (6 is usual) and back on after a cycle.,3
103849,Absolutely like this product it's a lot of fun to play with. the wax isn't the greatest but it comes out clean and smooth when you stamp it,3
97719,"The end cap/switch housing is a pain in the butt. I'm going to have to modify it. I constantly have to tighten it. Its on tight, but the light turns off, if I tighten it then it works again, but it was already tight! Grrr!!!!",3
100668,"When I received my package it was beat up quite a bit. Made me nervous, but nothing seemed broken, just worries me that they were rough with handling it. Fairly simple to put together! My phone doesn’t seem to fit in the phone holder though. It slips out.",3
83227,Beautiful item but the glass cross was broken in 4 pieces when I opened the box due to no packing material. Needed ASAP for a gift.,3
91420,Way too small for a small dog. Better for a tiny dog.,3
108226,Holds everything but is quite long,3
92016,"I don’t want to review the actual product, just wanted to warn others to beware of the size. It is much larger than I expected. I will have to decide what to do with them.",3
89455,a little stiff but does the job,3

99355,"Although this makes putting jewelry on easier, I would not recommend these for valuable, expensive jewelry. The magnets are just not strong enough. The slightest tug and apart they came!",3
94393,"The diapers seem well-made. However, I apparently chose the wrong size. I have a fourteen year old dachshund and the diapers will tape shut snugly but are so short on her rump that they just pretty much slide off. Haven’t worked for me, and not sure I will gamble another $20 or so to try a larger size.",3
87241,Somehow I did not grasp they were paper.,3
85966,I use this to monitor my doors and windows. Motion sensor does not always detect movement. Talk abilities need some work. Great night vision and signal strength is very good. Would like to have a longer live feed ability.,3
83939,It's about what I expected for the price. It's not at all soft and it left a ton of lint in the dryer on first wash. It also pulled in a couple of spots. I bought it to protect my duvet from my dogs so it meets my needs but if I'd gotten it to use as a blanket for humans it would go straight back.,3
109849,mic did dint work but the rest is ok,3
119855,"I know this product in liquid form is great, but these wipes didn't have enough of it on them to be super effective.",3
117409,Very pretty. But the backings are definitely not sterling silver/gold plated. I immediately got an infection.,3
86443,Arrived ripped on the side and it very hard to use.,3
101676,I was excited to get these salad tongs but was disappointed when I found that it was difficult to open. Hopefully it will get the more often we use them.,3
80232,"It,s OK. Cheap but I didn,t expect much. I do like the adjustable function. If the charger cord was any shorter it would be non existent. Easy to take out and about.",3
115819,did not like this it does not work well using the buttons would not buy it again,3
110358,They’re ok... thumb seems to be the only touch screen finger. Durability is sort of ok... I use them for motorcycling everyday but I’m not sure they would hold up in a crash. I’m just hoping they will...,3
95602,"This is a beautiful book. I had seen it at a friend's but was only able to glance very quickly at it so bought my own copy. Once in my hands with time to spend looking at it, I found it to be somewhat useless, like a coffee table book, a novelty. Pretty but not a go to for information.",3

103401,"The umbrella works ok, but it makes a lot of noise in the wind.",3
107437,both my 2 puppies love loved these but I am giving it 3 stars because it honestly didn't last long enough. It also stained my carpet.,3
97418,Good but WAY over priced. I will not likely purchase again,3
81902,"Nice full coverage mask but difficult to breathe with the mask on especially during the hot summertime. Wish there was a way this mask could be made with two thinner pieces of fabric (outer and liner) so breathing would be a little easier. Or, add one of those plastic gizmos that lets one breathe air easily.",3
96108,"The strap is inexpensive and that shows in the material finish. The leather is stiff and coarse. I bought this along with some more expensive straps and the others were much nicer, but also three or more times the price. Buy this one if you can't afford the others; otherwise, you will likely be better served with spending a little more on a strap that you enjoy wearing and makes you want to strap on your instrument and play. **If my review helped you, please click the “Helpful” button below.** Thanks!",3
107750,It's an decent plush. The hair is just a solid flat piece which was kind of disappointing.,3
80315,The product is ok ... You get what you pay for. Nothing more nothing less.,3
104788,Nice gaming platform.,3
108545,This doesn't work very well on pill bottles which was one of the main reasons I bought it.,3
96899,"Color and material is nice, blouse runs smaller than expected.",3
89157,it needs a mount for an ar15 for the barrel mounts with it are to large,3
113012,We returned this. Seemed like decent quality but the gray was almost blue/purple colored. I also didn’t prefer the larger square pattern as compared with other covers including the one we ended up keeping from another brand on amazon.,3
110646,"This is NOT a soft touch case. It is a smooth, slippery case that you will probably drop every time you pick it up. I am returning it. Updated: The Smoke/Volt color is the one that does not have soft touch. The others apparently do.",3
91841,"This chair was returned and then sent to me. I could see that it was assembled before I received it, hardware was scratched up and repackaged, arm rest were marked up. I didn't want to pack it all back up, so I kept it. I've had it less then a month and the seat bottom is flattening out, with not much cushion left. I'm 235 pounds, I was hoping that it was a better chair then this.",3
92942,"I give it 3 stars cause though the battery life is long, it kinda shorts out & turns off on its own often the closer it gets to dying. Other than that works great!!",3
84714,"Not as easy to install as advertised, and the instructions can be described as broken English at best. Once I deciphered through the jibberish and the equally non-helpful video, it wound up not working. If you have the time and already are familiar with wiring, go for it! Otherwise buy your camera someplace that will install with warranty!",3
117008,"This is oil rubbed bronze, NOT black! Also, it holds a lot less than I expected. The dimensions are an inch or so smaller than what the description states. Otherwise, it’s really cute.",3
114794,"I really liked Kurtherian Gambit up until just after they left earth. Since then it has started to drag and the characters, storylines, etc, haven't moved at all. The Kurtherian Endgame series and this book in particular is just more of the same. Great if you're looking for something easy to read on a holiday or at the beach but nothing new. I probably need to stop and switch to something different",3
83418,bought new mirror rod mount today,3
108873,"Easy to put on, it stays put, keeps the car protected from getting bird poop on it. However it gets very wet with the rain.",3
102145,"I just tried it out, haven’t know the different yet, I bought this base on the reviews, 2 bags seem a lot to me, I’m going to share it with my family members. I will keep you posted.",3
109997,Broke after 5 minutes.,3
98665,"This Wallet was bought for daughter cause she loves cats, but however its poor quality and not made to be used why I give three stars.",3
101731,"Great series, only problem was that the box art is boring and the wrap on the box was too secure",3
81092,It doesn't really work. Not good as expected. Won't do the trick.,3

119980,"It says set of 2, I only received 1. I wanted the other cushion because it goes well with my outside decor. I wish they would just send me the other cushion that I should have received. I have tried to find one to match from other sites and stores but have not been able to find one that matches.",3
98075,"It is a smaller than average inside, but it has lasted, so good quality",3
98019,They work although they aren’t of the quality of the brakes handle I purchased them to replace. They’ll work although would likely buy a more expensive set if I have to replace others in the future,3
98279,"Too thin for an alternative to an actual bed, but it's an upgrade for someone who's ok with sleeping on the floor - you can definitely feel the floor underneath you.",3
80997,"Good design, works well",3
99568,"Technically it works the way it should, synced easily. It does require a usb port on the console so i had to move some stuff which wasnt too big a deal. Why only 3 stars is that getting used to playing with that connected to your controller is tough. I used it mainly for Rocket League and it was kinda bulky and uncomfortable to play the game with. Maybe a better fit for less intense gaming.",3
84562,"Meh, not his best work",3
116092,"We just hatched our first set of chicks. Out of 8, 6 made it. One stopped developing I'm thinking around two weeks and one chick died after pipping. I would have lost two others but I could tell they where stressed so I helped them hatch. My problem with this incubator is one 1) you can't see the humidity rate in it. There is no humility monitor built in. 2) it's very hard to see inside. You have about and inch on the sides but when chicks start to hatch the sides fog up. I wish the top where clear so you could see better. I personally would not buy again. Actually I did not order this one my husband did.",3
109812,"just right size in my small cabinet. good price as well. however, the installation is tricky. With a small peice of paper instruction with crapy tiny diagrams wasted so much time.",3
105816,It is a good product but I don't know if I would buy it again It is just me but I thought it would work better I think I had to high of expectations but do take a chance with it as it is a good product,3
117086,It doesnt work as good as i hoped for...,3
113746,it’s just okay. Matches most standard farmhouse style butcher block tables however the legs are uneven. It’s an easy enough fix for my husband so we won’t return it but it speaks of the quality of the product. Wouldn’t repurchase.,3
101918,"Didn't realize we had to assemble but wasn't too bad. Magnets are not strong when you close the door. We bought a Magnet and put on it and now it closes fine. When kids would close it, it would not stay closed due to weakness of the magnet. It is a good price and great storage.",3
89532,It’s kinda small and the battery runs out quick but the price is good,3
99352,"The faucet did not work. The vessel is beautiful and works great, 5 stars. Suggestion to vendor: provide faucet specs and remove it from package. Including a bad faucet gives false expectations that bring frustrations.

84327,"It's not bad, the metal part with the hinges and lid just feels kind of wobbly and flimsy.",3
111087,"Cute slippers, from the top view. I don't like the wool bottoms, its like I'm sweeping the floor when I walk around the house in these. between the wool that grabs and the static it makes they are covered in hair and lint. I only wear them when I've just vacuumed. they aren't snug or super warm either. I prefer my ACORN slippers.",3
96718,Seemed to run a little small. Ok quality. Good for the price I guess. Not really that soft.,3
90878,pricey for what they are. I mean c'mon.,3
91271,"Sound good , look good . But you cant see the blue backlight unless its completely dark . Save the time and money and get the non backlit ones",3
88375,I've purchased this before and really like it so I reordered. This set is missing purple.,3
104590,36 inches seemed larger than it is.,3
112822,Love the chair and the price but is a pain to put in the car. There is hardly any space to put your hand when installing rear facing.,3
85427,"It's looks good, but is smaller than I expected and one of the zipper doesn't work very well",3
107063,These are cute nail accessories but would have been nicer to have some instructions for use or at least tips.,3
93022,"I purchased this because several reviews said that their phone screen didn't break when in the case - even when dropped. That was not the case for me. Everytime i've dropped it, even just a little bit (on the side and a short distance), it has left my screen with a crack. For someone who isn't as clumsy as me, im sure this would be sufficient.",3
115623,"I've been using Pureology for a while now. I love that they are a vegan, cruelty-free line. My hair has been feeling really dry lately and since I've been using Pureology's moisturizing shampoo & conditioner for a while, I decided to mix it up and get this Precious Oil shampoo and conditioner instead. Like with most Pureology products, I love the way my hair feels. It's soft and bouncy. However, I'm not in love with the smell. It's heavy and perfume-y. And my hair continues to smell like the product for at least a day or so after washing. It kind of gives me a headache. I won't be buying this one again, but I'll certainly be buying one of Pureology's other lines instead.",3
90054,"Usually when we get the same size with other suppliers it fits, but this time came a little bit oversized",3
116589,"Yea, the reviews say it all. I believe it cracked or chipped a bit. It was pretty though. I think i dropped it once and that was it i don’t remember lol sorry",3
94922,Need to have a larger bottom strap,3
94287,Button was scuffed and not put on strait when it came.......,3
82945,The fabric is very nice. I like the feel. It’s not scratchy. It’s easy to tie to the comforter. I also really liked the directions that came with the cover itself for easiest way to get the cover on the comforter. I have a king sized so that was really helpful for me. When I went to zip the cover up I noticed A LOT of loose seems and loose threads along the seams of the cover. Especially around the zipper. Very very disappointed by this. I’ve decided to keep it as I like all other aspects of this cover. I got mine in white and it’s true white. I just wish the quality was better. That really was a disappointment for me. I’ve reinforced the seam as best as I can by hand. I will just be sure to maybe but the next cover in person.,3
90679,the package was a little damaged when it got here the plastic on the side was open and the little pieces were all around.,3
115910,I would like to get the bottom cover replaced as it wore off and broke in less than 4 months..,3
100631,This child seat is of average quality. The mounting is not secure. The bottom plastic is easy to scratch the leather chair.,3
115271,This book is very average. The major arcana is explained well and kind of just breezes by the minor arcana.,3
110840,"Cute cars, but too loud. Kids have much better hearing than adults, but these things will make me deaf. I'm opening their cases and putting cardboard over the speaker to make it safer.",3
83305,I expected more character development and a more complex plot. I found the book to be repetitive with too much time focused on the character's internal struggles and not enough on intrigue.,3
98872,"No inch ruler, only cm.",3
112969,The product is fine and as good as any other similar charging pad but the circular shaped pads all seem to have the same flaw - you have to place the phone in just the right direction to get it to charge. The stand type chargers force you to put it down in the right way but the circular pads obviously don’t so they’re not as good.,3
83845,The bracelet broke the next day randomly beads everywhere but the case is really pretty,3
113618,"This product depends upon: Solar availability, care of water level, and 'patience'. In addition, it really needs more detailed directions, and how to deal with the intermittent spray/no spray. It does not just 'start up' and continue running with direct sunlight. The fine print on the back of directions suggests you leave it out of the water in full sunlight for two hours. This is really a good way to 'charge' the battery. I still need to try this. Who knew you could 'charge' a lithium battery? I am working on the fine tuning this requires, because when it works, it's really great! Yes, it is slightly overcast right now, and it does spray intermittently. Also, the needs for water need to be monitored. With a good capacity it does well. In lesser water volume it needs extra attention . I was inclined to give up on this, but do enjoy it so much when it functions. A work in Progress.",3
106523,"Item is OK, but over priced and so so quality",3
111006,The outer carton was intact but the product wrapping was all torn. There was no damage to the papers themselves except for few small indentations on the edges but after flattening the defects the papers should feed through the printer without jamming. The bubble wrap inside the carton were totally flat. These comments were true for each of the three cartons I received.,3
101407,not very well constructed. not great but not bad. will keep but would not buy again. have not washed it yet.,3

101809,"We’ve had 2 of these. Identical. The first was awesome, we just flat wore it out. This second one has never worked properly. Once the propane bottle is inserted, you can hear and smell the propane and the clicker will NOT start the flame. It’s necessary to use a separate lighter device (which we never had to do on the first one). Not sure if something in the quality of manufacturing changed, or if we just got a dud.",3
90867,"Instead of making my pc looks neat, it does whole lot more mess.",3
117157,It doesn't even have all the levels for me.,3
105248,Smaller than expected. Disappointed.,3
90673,"This book was in many ways a typical Riley Hart book, which means it was well written and had an awesome cast of friends and real/found family which always adds so much depth to her characters and her books. Actually, that may be the biggest reason I love her books in general. I way enjoyed the protagonists Ash and Beau and the progression of their relationship. I guess for me, although I was glad to spend time with Kenny, Beau’s brother, it was sort of understood that Beau needed to stick around close to home to help with Kenny, and yet other than occasional speech issues, Kenny seemed to be functioning just fine. So to me he came across more as a plot device than a person because I just couldn’t get a handle on him. So for me the book was good, but not great.",3
90849,Alot of stuff but not as useful as i thought they would be.,3
89037,"Good characters, good, light mystery with intrigue. Pretty quick page turner. Several typos. Will read book four and see if editing is better.",3
109566,"It worked wonders on the copper bottoms of some of my pots! They were shinier than new BUT it ruined two very, very old cookie sheets, rubbing off all the finish so that I had to toss them out.",3
118609,"The glue that makes these lights adhesive is very weak. I hung these lights in a straight line behind my tv to provide some ambiance. Less than 6 hours after installing, they were hanging off the wall and needed to be held up by tape. I ended up super gluing these into place and wish I had not paid the ""extra"" to buy lights that were ""self-adhesive"". You are better off buying lights without glue on the back and installing yourself. Flexible is also a misleading description for this item. I wrapped these lights behind my tv in straight lines with ""rounded corners"" so I didn't cut the strips. The moment you try to hang these lights any way besides straight (i.e. corners) you WILL HAVE TO USE SUPER GLUE. They do bend but if you aren't holding it in place then they go back to their natural state - straight. The remote control works well but the lights shows are not as customizable as the description made me believe. If you want to have the lights change color, it just cycles all the color values. You cannot have it just cycle between blue and white or something like that. I don't think these are actually capable of doing any colors besides those pre-installed on the remote. Trying to use the RGB +/- buttons to tweak the colors does not appear to do anything. These are super bright! Only aspect of this item that warrants more than 3 stars.",3
113476,Super small bag. Other than my chrome book I can’t really fit much else . The quality is good though.,3
85481,"I couldn't get it to work with my setup but at least it was an easy return. I would not buy this for a pond, which was my use. The cord is really short but more importantly, it is not grounded. It seems like an electrocution risk.",3
91560,This is what the driver did to my yard today!,3
80496,It is extremely small and it might fit a 2 year old girl but definitely not a four year old. I have to return the item.,3
105604,So much smaller then I thought they were going to be,3
101774,Its very soft seems durable. Took less than three weeks to get it and that’s with ordering on Xmas day. So far so good except the paints chipped on the bottom but that’s no biggie. I have yet to use it though.,3
103260,"Was a little disappointed as the photo showed it looking Silver/Black but is actually bright yellow/Black. The quality is good, I’m still using it and have no issues about a month later.",3
92802,"Tested this product out, I let the ink sit to soak the brush for a day so it was 100% coated, but that's mainly cause i forgot about it (it should take only a small bit of time to soak to the brush). Looks like it's made for short, tiny/skinny lines, because when you try to go bigger/thicker/curvier, the brush paints/looks like like a frayed, dried marker. Also, the package comes with only 2 ink cartridges, theres not one in the pen. Yhe entire thing is in a different language(not a bad thing), so if you dont know how cartridges work with pens or any details you'll have to look it up!",3
91848,"I've had the humidifier for a couple of weeks, and I've followed the manual. However, I can't keep the water from seeping into the base of the unit. This is a great concern because I have hardwood floors. Unfortunately, I did not carefully read the reviews before purchase. Other than that, I like it.",3
119689,It is a cheap plastic ladle. It gets the job done but I wish I could have one that was a bit more rigid than this.,3

92924,It was fine initially. After 1 month it got loose and is not fitting. Not very happy. Wasted money.,3
119934,"I bought/received two of these. The first one required a return because while the green light powered on, the speaker wasn't working and I was unable to hear any noise. The second one arrived without any problems, but I realized shortly thereafter that this isn't the ideal sound machine. I planned on using it every night for my son. However, it runs on batteries and I began to worry that they'd eat up those batteries relatively quickly. I ended up keeping the device because it was my oversight that this doesn't have any support for A/C power, but we stopped using it right after. I bought another sound machine for my baby with a plug this time. Now all my kids have identical sound machines which works fine for us.",3
97860,Not too good quality,3
87909,"Disappointed in this gate. Overall it’s exactly what I was looking for, purchased to keep my toddler out of the kitchen. The install wasn’t exactly a breeze, but wasn’t terrible either. Was actually really satisfied the first 2 days - however by day 3, the latch is already sticking and you have to jiggle the handle/button it to get the gate latched. For the price it definitely should’ve lasted more than 3 days. So now I have to decide if I want to send back or not, which is extra annoying since it was a hassle to put up in the first place.",3
87499,No instructions and the shoulder pads don’t really attach to the vest. Kind of not clear how to use them correctly. Would also be nice to have labels on the weights so you can see how much they weight.,3

100684,"decent bowls for the price, bright colors and lightweight nesting design. my problem is the plastic is so soft and thin that my hand mixer keeps taking chunks out of the bowl. these would be great for just separating and simple stirring but not good with most kitchen utensils",3
99919,Nice scent...just not as great as all the reviews. Not sure if i would purchase again.,3
112489,Not a bad game. Bonus money could be more. Some of the games are a little childish,3
111014,Breaks very easily. We’ve been through 2 in a few weeks.,3
102693,It is a nice piece but I think the cost is more then what you get. The wood feels like a cheap plastic coating on top and all the parts where not used but came with no instructions. It works well for the time being.,3
109785,"I purchased this item to burn into wood for decorative pieces. The pen does not get hot enough and if it does, the heat does not last long. I have to keep walking away so that it can reheat. The tips unscrew easy which forces you to have to continuously screw it back which involves using the silicone tips or turning the pen off completely to tighten the screw. Overall, it has made me frustrated enough to give up.",3
85165,this product has a lot of features but the laser is odd shape and flickers. other than that it's ok for the price. nice for night use for varmint. mounted on my 223. no problem with reticles sticking.,3
95569,The sleeves is too big..fabric too thin and cheap,3

98712,"I had purchased a 3 light set, and only received 2 of the 3 lights.. repeatedly trying to get the third light sent to me, cause I really do like it and WANT the 3rd light, to be used in my house that we are updating.

88146,"The flavors that are seen on this bag are not in the bag. Just the same traditional colors, grape, cherry orange and chocolate. The only reason why I ordered the bag in the first place was because it offered the unusual flavors. Disappointed.",3

102401,"Trust the other reviews and save yourself the aggravation! I really like the print on this pillowcase-thus the 3 stars. However, as others have stated, the zipper opening is ridiculously tiny!!! It will take a team of people to wrangle a body pillow into the tiny opening on this pillowcase. It's half as big as the small end of the case. I guess they must have only had tiny zippers on hand? Anyway, after struggling for 10 minutes, I was completely frustrated by my inability to fit the pillow through the zippered opening, and just gave up. I could see the signs of stress on the pillowcase at the zipper's end, and am afraid it's going to rip next time I try to put a pillow in there. Bummer... :(",3
118873,I am enjoying the book series and the author,3
80505,"I ordered this because I remembered being fascinated with this trinket in my childhood. This Drinking Bird dips like it is supposed to, but its dipping motion causes it to scoot all over the surface - including off the table before you know it. The product does not include the cup, either. For the minimal cost, not a big deal, but I think there are better models available. I should have studied the options more carefully.",3
97426,Material is a little thinner than expected and we'll have to hope it still fits come spring as it will be more suitable then but it is still very cute,3
95216,"This Christian book gives interesting insight into the discernment of spirits, imagination and visions. Good alternative meanings of Hebrew and Greek words makes for interesting insight. For a better grasp of what Mel is saying I expect one would need to read several of his other books.",3

85309,My scarlet macaw loved it for a few days then disassembled it.,3
94280,"This went together fairly easily but if you are looking for perfect this is not for you. It looks great but the wood product is so soft and cheap that you can expect chipping around screw holes and perhaps minor damage on edges. The good news is that once put together it does look nice. The doors fit perfectly. All in all, you get what you pay for!",3
82915,My husband wants more Bigfoot scent so he can be wilder... He loves it but after I told him the price he started limiting his use.. saving it instead of using daily.,3
85077,It’s a cool toothbrush and a four-year-old I gave it to like that however my two-year-old thought it was a fun toy but wouldn’t brush his teeth with it because it was too strong,3
97697,These are 8 mm but too long for my gate,3
115459,The colors are vibrant and it's a very sturdy set of mugs. Only thing is it's not comfortable to hold with one hand through the loop and drink. Wish it had a more comfortable hold as it's pretty heavy,3
102386,I should have just bought a lid. Cleanup is too much.,3
115818,"I have had issues with stress and anxiety from my cat. We thought we corrected the issue and learned we had not. To attempt to find something that works for my cat, the vet suggested calming treats. After some research on different brands I found these and the price was right. I ordered them. They are too big for most cats to take straight, so I have to cut one treat up. We only use them every other weekend when we have the BFs daughter. My cat doesn’t particularly care for them and won’t eat them freely. I have to come up with creative ways for him to ingest them. I paired these treats, with a diffuser, and a calming collar. That seemed to relax him to the point he wasn’t aggressive and urinating outside the box. I think a combo of these treats and the diffusers really helped. I would give him one in the AM And then another in the PM, unless he displayed behavior that required an earlier dosage.",3
95896,"The boot is beautiful. Love everything about it. However, it does run small. I’ve been a size 7 for over 15 years and I have narrow feet. If you purchase, definitely get a size up. Unfortunately for me I bought this boot a few ago and wore them today for the first time and after walking with them for a few hours my foot is so sore. It’s too late for reimbursement. Had this been the correct size I would’ve been so happy with this purchase.",3

91187,Would be a 5 star if fitted sheet worked better - not tight enough,3
92057,"It's okay as long as your not trying to fit anything too big on it. The gates don't open that far. A hat, water bottle,or small gear and it's fine. Honestly, you don't want a bunch of bigger gear flopping and banging around anyway.",3
109587,We didn't get the necklace it was supposed to come with.,3
113468,"One isn't tied tight so the beads slide all over. Definitely big enough for a man's wrist. I love one of them, the other one is basically unusable, so I basically paid $10 for one. Maybe I'll take the other one apart and re-purpose the lava stones?",3
109349,Didnt like the smell. Put it on after shower.,3
92160,"Delivered on time, A little overpriced but not bad.",3
92697,It was disappointing that the full page inserts are larger (wider) than the tabs in the binder. The Tabs need to be wider so you can see them when using the full page inserts They are a great size to put in recipes you have printed out.,3
86917,Diffuser worked great. Hated the beeping noises it made. Would wake me up when it would shut off in the middle of the night.,3
87422,Not as cushy as other reviews said. Not worth sending back but disappointed. Feels like rug doesn't have a pad underneath.,3
193078,love these greeting cards! they're small but adorable. will definitely be buying again.,5
166523,I buy it for my granddaughter to do crafts with. She like the tapes and sticks it on everything. She uses the tapes to decorate her iPhone 6s which with a clear case gives it a one of a kind look. With this pack it gives you 40 different tapes and she loves them all.

192343,I was so pleasantly surprised with my husband's pick of this cap for me. Even the description makes it sound fun as it is. Good for a young or older person as I can attest to.

188120,"This toothpaste is pretty great! I must say at first I was a little hesitant using a black toothpaste. I have been wanting to try activated charcoal and this seemed like the perfect option. Less chemicals than normal toothpastes and has probiotics for healthier teeth! For me personally, I like extreme minty feeling after brushing, this does not leave that however, I have noticed a remarkable difference in how my mouth tastes when I wake up! So while the initial feeling is not as minty, I have better breath after extended times. Does not foam like your typical toothpaste however, you brush in the same way! Excited to see extended results!",5

I have loved Andre and his causes since the trio of books Abuse came out. I really enjoyed reading about Andre's new project to save the innocent.

160295,For the price cant go wrong. Ive only had it a short time so cannot make statement regarding its longevity.,5
183357,Works well have noticed a difference in just the first 2 days my dog will start to bark then the coller seems to confuse her and she gets distracted and forgets what she was barking at. The unit itself is a nice size not too bulky my dog is 35 lbs and rather small she doesnt even seem to notice the box. Display is easy to read and all the functions are on one button and easy to change sensitivity and mode settings. I love that it has the option for no shock and a shock option. The product will beep for a few seconds vibrate twice then give a small static shock when in shock mode. Very light shock ive had worse in the winter from a blanket but enough to discourage the dog from barking. In no shock mode the unit will beep and vibrate only. I plan to use shock mode at first then transition into the no shock. I like that it allows you to do this by keeping the beeps and vibrations before the shock once trained the beep will be enough to stop the behavior without needing the added correction of the shock. The collars provided are easy to slip into the main unit while not recommended for tie out or walking are nicely made the nylon one has a well fastening plastic buckle and the plastic one has a belt clip and holes. Both are reflective as well so that is an added bonus. Took her for a swim and the unit survived so it does seem to be waterproof as well,5
175133,IF FIT PERFECTLY. SHE LIKES IT VERY MUCH.,5
191712,We use this outside at the pool to watch movies at night. Plenty bright. Would recommend for thos application.,5

196244,It takes 3 weeks to fully repel each & every rodent from your house.,5
191695,I am so impressed with this dress. The fabric is so soft and stretchy but doesn’t go sheer when stretched. It’s is true to size for US sizing which seems hard to find these days.

161868,"I was skeptical about this. I didn't think it would get as heat as a real dryer, but it sure does! I have thick, curly hair. I used flexi-rods and my hair set perfectly. They recommend drying for 20-30 minutes, however if you have a lot of hair, you know you have to stay under longer. What I did was took breaks, and in total used it for about an hour and 15 minutes. You can adjust the hood to fit you more comfortably; so glad to have found this! I can travel with it easily.",5

165077,"I absolutely love this helmet. It is so hard to find a helmet that fits my kids' head properly, however, this fits perfect. The thing that I like most about this helmet is the adjustable back. My three year old and five year old can both wear this helmet, which is great! I wasn't sure if this would fit my five year old, his head measures 55 cm, but the small was a perfect fit. The helmet also has a padded chin strap which makes it comfortable to wear. My three year old often refuses his helmet, but I had no problems with this one.",5
199538,"Received my wig on time & had a gift of ventilated wig caps included with it. The wig looks exactly like the wig advertised. I have a fairly large forehead , but this cap is comfortable & fits perfectly. The hair is full & dense & the curls are beautiful. The mixed brown & blonde color is exactly as described & beautiful. Curls are soft, very realistic, & without that high shine that most people hate. Because it’s a tight ,curl, you will need to either finger comb & or shake it & use a pick to style it the way you want. The wig is compressed on delivery & because of that I shake it first , then I use a spritzer containing water & a small amount of a detangling leave in conditioner that I spray on the wig ,before I shake it a 2nd time & style it. It’s a lot of hair which I like because it fits my face. However some ppl might want to tweeze out hairs or use other methods of reducing the bulk. The only thing I could ask for to make this wig better is for it to be a lace front. I highly recommend this cost saving, beautiful wig.",5

174772,I like the durability of this one. And that you can customize the size you need for different shoes. Has a cover to keep dust out and handles to pull out from under the bed. I did not like that if you ever pick up the box the shoes slide under the deviders,5
181912,"I'm usually the type to save up my money to buy legit, more expensive products from reputable brands because I believe the increased cost is a superior investment in the long term. But this time I decided to go the other route after doing my researching and finding out the ludicrous costs of keyboards from brands like razer and corsair. I was hesitant at first because this product is obviously from china and from a not so known brand. But after looking at the high reviews from other customers, I decided to take the plunge. I went with the stainless steel, blue-back lit option. So far after a year of use, I'm happy to report that this product is worth the cost. For only $40 you get a well made product with good (but unnecessary) features. The clicks are very tactile and is a joy to use. They are extra loud which some of you might prefer. But be aware that the loud noise might be an annoyance to others. I had to use my laptop keyboard in my room at night to not awake my roommate. Tha back lit feature is welcome but after using it for the first month, I leave it off. Actually, I'm only writing this review because I enjoy the typing experience on the keyboard so much and am using it to write this. Overall, a good $40 investment if you enjoy typing and are seeking an entry level mechanical keyboard to experience it.",5

185512,"I often use my Iphone 6S plus. It's always out of power, so I bought this cell phone charging box in Amazon. It's really good to use, it can be carried in real time, it can be put in your trousers pocket, it can be put in your bag, it doesn't need to use charging wires, and it can protect your Iphone 6S plus, let's go. It is free from wear and tear. It's not very big, and it weighs just right. It charges really fast. There are many reasons to like this situation. One reason is that it feels smooth but not slippery. So it won't slip away from me. Gold: Another important reason I really like this charger is that you can use your iPhone charger! Therefore, you don't need to carry extra cables with you, or you don't need to use two cables. If you don't have Bluetooth headset, you can still use the headset adapter.

I'm a funny one to fit (5'3"" and over 200 lbs, most of it in the middle, which makes it hard to fit most clothing). So I ordered the XXL and it fit perfectly. Now, like every single thing I put on, it hugs up to me too much on my gut, but that's my gut, NOT the shirt's fault at all. Once I lose about 10 lbs (of the 50+ I need to lose), it will fall and flow just perfectly. Usually, I have to order a size larger than I wear just to fit my middle, then the shoulders and neck are too big. With this shirt, the shoulders and neck are perfect, and will be even once I lose the 10 LBS. Can't wait to order more colors of these!! Love the material and colors.",5

79853,For the price I figured they wouldn’t be as good as the more expensive ones but they are made of extremely thin sheet metal. Have a 1-2” gap around them and do not even include rubber for the edges just a foam round foam sticky pad for the bottom corner.

That being said now that I’ve had them for some time and haven’t really used them very hard. Just mainly a few hours a week.

Top was lose, and the external white pre-filter was completely black. Banged around so much in transit it was covered in a very thick black lawyer of soot, inside and out. As a result its blowing soot all over instead of filtering the air. To large to return. Just hoping it stops blowing soot...",2

There are now chunks of material missing from all over and what is left is hard to the touch- it is entirely unusable now. Apparently it cannot be machine washed & is not dryer safe. We had initially thought it was great, but are now very disappointed.",2

I also would expect Platinum Pets to remedy this situation by sending me replacement rubber loops for the bowls, but that may be wishful thinking.

49671,"Used six of these on a recent family trip. Four flights later, two of them were bent. They are made of some sort of metal, maybe aluminum, and if they get tossed around or mangled in the luggage processing facility they will bend. The idea is good - I like only being able to see your name on the info card and your address and phone number covered but having them bent up after only one use? They need to change the material to a silicone or leather type of material that can handle being tossed around by man and machine.",2

58386,"The back of the case is nice, slicker than I thought which is fine, still comfortable, but the overall materials (rubber/plastic casing) is pretty flimsy. Though the most important feature, the lip for the glass screen, is just too short by a mm or 2. So, if you use a glass screen protector, like zagg, when putting phone face down, you will be sitting on the glass, not on the case's lip. Also, I dont believe that if this phone was dropped that it would actually do much for protection. I was under the impression this would be a bit more rigid, like incipio or incase. Full edge shock protection is quite a stretch.",2

40930,"Why is there a drawstring? The picture and description doesn’t mention anything about the suit having a drawstring around the neck. The velcro width is thin but strong, which is the only pro. The fabric feels like spandex, which idk if it’s a good thing or a bad thing. I purchased this and the exact same one from a different seller for $1 more, and the more expensive one didn’t come with a drawstring and had a wider velcro. Returning this and keeping the other.",2
76244,Actually I have had nothing but trouble replacing a strand of lights from the one's I bought last year. I have now bought quite a few that did not match.,2
74377,"First, this product did not fit my 2004 Honda CRV, as advertised, without cutting off the tow hook, a task I couldn't have completed if I was trying to install this at home. Secondly, the day after installation we loaded a bike rack and a single bike onto the hitch, only for the back driver side bolt to immediately shear off. When I contacted the company, they were polite but unable to answer my question about the size or grade of the bolt. We ended up going to Uhaul who generously gave us some of the extra carriage bolts and accompanying rectangular plates. All of those bolts were at least a grade five. The bolts in this package are not labeled with markings to suggest what grade they are. I ended up asking the Pep Boys crew who installed to replace all the bolts, and in addition to the one sheared bolt, there was etching along the others, suggesting that they too were weakening. While my situation is now under control, this hitch caused quite a few extra headaches, and I would be wary about trusting that it fits the vehicles it claims to fit and that the quality is sufficient to hold even a minor load.",2

44511,"I purchased thos fishing tackle kit, however I did not realise how small the kit is. Unable to use it will keep it in storage.",2
76487,"The fit is to put it in the words of my wife, ""old man pants"". Which just means it was very baggy in the wrong places. Compared to other pants purchased that are regular fit, it appeared too lose. However the fit with regards to size appeared to be accurate as the waist and length was correct, just the style appeared outdated. To be clear, I'm not comparing the fit to ""slim fit"" type styles. I'm comparing to regular fit as I had ordered these for work. We have business casual but wear ties, no coat or jacket. I'm hopeful this will be updated as the price is very economical and I purchase these with the attitude it's a uniform.",2
66766,The design makes it very hard to wash baby's lower body,2

65225,Not good product recieved one that was broken ..,2
56262,"The design I got was pretty cute, it’s the black one with the stars on it. Unfortunately, it’s cheaply made, because one week after use, the black started rubbing off and you can see the white underneath. Also in the photos, you can see on the edges it’s starting to break. Overall wouldn’t recommend. You can get a much better quality one for a few dollars more.",2
57899,They are cute in person. I bought the xl and they fit my daughter who is a size 4/5. Very disappointed in fit.,2
57613,The design was not thought through here. The soft tip leaves hairs in my glassware.,2
50017,Didn't fit well. Pops up in the middle which makes it difficult to text.,2
48186,"I have two very specific things that I HATE about this clock. (1) The most dim display setting is still tremendously too bright. It lights up the entire room and (2) when you wake to radio you can not turn the volume down to wake you more gently. The radio comes on quietly for about 5 seconds and then becomes significantly too loud. When I read the directions, it says that the wake to radio volume setting can't be turned down, because they do not want you to inadvertently set it to no sound at all (and thus not wake you up). I appreciate the need for a minimum sound setting, but it should be one third of what it is now. You must turn off the radio once it wakes you up, because no one would ever want it this loud. BUT, the clock LOOKS cool, the time sets itself, there is a cool USB charger for your phone. Still the two flaws listed above make this a clock radio that I would not recommend.",2
64173,Texture is terrible. Mushy and crusty and VERY SWEET. yuck.,2
61238,Cheap product broken after one week of use...,2
71465,"It looks great and is reasonably well made. But I'm sending it back for three reasons. It smells like mold. The zipper is sewn in a way that the edge of zipper gets caught in the teeth as you zip it up. Super annoying. Strap is sadly too short. I guess I fall into the ""particularly burly"" category, as the product description cautions. I'm 5ft 9in and 185 lbs. Worn across the body the bag is at the level of my stomach.",2
79218,I'm really bummed. I was excited thinking I got a good deal read the good reviews but this product didnt work. and tended to hurt my teeth 😔,2
71925,Yes it pumped water. The tether was too short to keep a consistent contact to run the pump. But when it does run it doesn't shut off when the water is gone. Returning it.,2

78069,Packaging came in fine but once we tried it on ourselves the staple on the side barely held. We actually wasn’t able to use this at all for our Pirate Party. Bummer because the quality and colors looked great. However once you try to assemble it just doesn’t hold up . Maybe you can try it on yourself and tape it on the side? Or you can try re-stapling the whole set again..,2

79779,This one fell apart on first use. I'd say it performed very poorly compared to others I bought and use.,2
62251,The plot was really weak. It was like watching a cheap Hollywood movie where nothing in the plot surprises.,2
41146,"I don't know how they can list up to 16 mile range. We just used these for a drive from Florida to Pennsylvania. It probably should say range of 1.6 miles. It definitely did not have over a 2 mile range. If you were close to the other car they worked fine, but honestly anything over a mile was bad or not at all. These did not meet my need for them at all.",2

They did not make contact without having to wiggle them to work and on one other controller, when I put the cover on, the batteries would shift and lose contact. I think they were poorly designed.

56646,"I really liked this bra, it fit great which many of don't, but after owning it for less than two months it's already broken. There is a hook on the strap that attaches to the back and it broke off. The hook allows the straps to be warn criss-cross if you want - which I never did - but the down side is the hook easily bent, would hook onto shirts I wore, and then the strap would come off. Many times I would have to bend the hook back in shape in order for the strap to stay attached. This morning the hook finally broke. It's such a bummer to finally find a sports bra that fits and seems to be supportive enough to be able to run in it only to have it break in less than two months.",2

73646,"Honestly, the size is amazing for my bunny. Great large wide cage love love LOVE the size. but absolutely HATE the way its built. so many damn pieces, it is so hard to get the top of the cage on to the bottom without a five minute battle.

I have figured out zip ties in ever corner and every where really secures it to be sturdy. but seriously, I don't know how any one can give this a 5 stars with no issues with it what so ever. PLEASE make this cage better.",2
72462,The interface is clunky. But the really annoying thing is the menus are static and risk burn in on the TV. The small amount of information that is displayed should float around the screen and there should be a screen saver option. Also the cube should be able to read me a book through the stereo without turning the tv on at all.,2

77772,There very dim and one of the parts came broke. I’m using them but very disappointed,2
77572,"Liked this at first but took it on a 2nd trip and the light doesn't come on now. So useless in the dark. Would not buy again. Easy to set the alarm, seems durable, and I like the 8 minute snooze. Downside is that the light is bright and a little hard to look at when you're half asleep and snoozing it (not like the old Timex Indiglo which was visible and a softer light). It's a little bigger than I was expecting but I didn't really look at the dimensions. Would buy again.",2
69205,"I seriously recommend you find a different product or spend the extra money on a quality product! After reading many glowing reviews I decided to try this Takstar. I immediately regretted my decision. My batteries would get so hot that you could feel the heat emanating from the product. I attempted to use it anyway, despite my better judgement. The sound quality is ok, at best. WARNING: The Takstar not only eats batteries, but it makes them so hot that they melt into the product itself! After examining the product and information thoroughly and going through three different batteries in this way...I had no choice but to throw it away. It's a sad waste of money.",2

The top panel controls are so so, Bluetooth on it is crap, and the remote only works by a weird 3.5mm cable with very limited range signal receiver on it.

53849,Liked the idea of it but it's very bulky and the magnets SUCK,2
47998,Whoever designed the cage and this product is evil. The bottom pan in the cage is practically useless because it is so shallow. They should either include this product with the cage or make deeper pans. Putting this thing together and getting it to fit in the cage is a nightmare. Say goodbye to being able to close the cage doors!!! Yet another poorly designed and difficult product from Midwest. Unfortunately I only got this cage because it is the least horrible in a bare market.,2
53803,You get what you pay for. The Olympic Barbell fitting is too large for most bars. I can’t imagine that a CAP barbell would be this large either or no other brands would fit their bars. The two pictures show the discrepancy in sizing from standard Olympic barbell sleeve diameters. Don’t recommend. Spend the extra $0.10 a pound and get something that won’t shake on the bar.,2

I am average sized for an American woman, but I couldn't get the stripped part of the tights above my knees; the design had absolutely no give.

77634,Liked the grill but 1 lamp quit working on first try.,2
63475,First time time trying to use this the plastic handle piece broke off. If that already wasn't enough the umbrella nylon material feels like a paper thin nylon jogging rain jacket shell and I am skeptical it would hold up to any strong rain/wind.

49868,"I bought this because I finally finished with a bottle of Mesmerize from a few years ago and thought it would be nice to try all the products. The roll-on and body wash are just okay, but the body lotion was awful and had a weird, off-putting and cheap smell that didn't compliment the cologne at all. This new bottle of cologne is very weak and after about 1 hour there was no scent left. Nothing compared to the bottle I had just used. Not even close. The bottle and cap look different, too. It was like a very weak knock off. Not buying again.",2

66652,"We like babyganics diapers and wish we could continue to use them. Their diapers have become increasingly more difficult to find, making amazon pretty much the only place to buy them. With no coupons available they are just too expensive for what you get. Review also reflects extremely poor customer service. I tried to get in touch with someone via multiple avenues and ultimately have never heard back from anyone. We are taking our dollars elsewhere.",2
57283,"These casters were simple to install and seemed to be of decent quality. After testing them out on my hardwood floor, I was left with a couple of concerns. 1. The wheels will catch debris, and unless they are maintained consistently, will end up scratching the flood. 2. The wheels only have one point of contact with the floor, while traditional casters have two. While this decreases friction and helps them move easier, it could leave indentations in some flooring surfaces. 3. When moving while seated, the wheels can bind when changing directions, which was annoying. 4. This last issue seems a little silly, but these wheels move too well. I found myself gliding away from my desk unless I had my feet firmly planted on the floor. So, unless you are interested in some racing wheels for your office chair (which these would be fantastic for), I can't recommend them as a substitute for a good chair mat.",2
58763,"First of all, these are not anti-fingerprint. My company cell phone has an anti-fingerprint glass screen protector and this is not it. Secondly, it went on just fine, but the edges don't seem to want to seal properly. I ended up removing the first one and trying the second, only to have it do the same thing. I've left the second one on, but I have a feeling it won't stay on long, so they were both a waste imo.",2

46786,These shoes are nice and light and would dry quickly. However the tie on one of the shoes does not catch and hold so that if worn in the water it would become so loose that the shoe would come off. Therefore it needs to be returned unworn in the water. How is this product returned? There was no packing slip in the bag.,2
63643,"I have a couple products from Radha Beauty that are great. I really wanted to love this humidifier but the warm mist option simply doesn't work. It is also impossible to fill without making a bit of a mess reconnecting the tank to the basin. All of the other functions are great, especially the essential oil compartment. If you don't care about warm mist, this is fine. If you were hoping for a warm mist to help you out through a freezing New England winter like I am, maybe skip this one.",2

58860,"I bought this product to keep my young children out of my cabinets. I liked the thought of not having to drill holes in cabinets or having large bulky locks on the outside of handles. I received my order in a timely manner. I was under the impression that “12 pieces” meant 12 locks...super excited about that! I was very disappointed when I opened the box to find only 10 and even more disappointed when 2 broke while installing. So now, I have 5 locks which have lasted about a month and a half. 3 locks have broke off or the adhesion has dried up. Overall I’m not impressed and wouldn’t recommend this product.",2

62340,"The interface with computer is good, the sound quality is good, the delivery was fast and it works well for running. For front-crawl swimming- not so much. I tried different bud sizes and different ways to jam it in the goggles bend, but it still kept filling with water..",2

60984,"The style is exactly what I wanted, and the price was right. Sound quality is very impressive. But the earpiece angle is all wrong for my ears. The part where the sound comes out tends to press against the skin rather than send sound into the ear. I've tried shifting them around, wearing them backwards -- it's no good. Since Sony quit making their marvelous similar-style headphones I've been looking for a replacement. This isn't it! Maybe they might fit your ears and head but they sure don't work for me Advice: save your packaging so you can return them. Better advice: save your money and buy something else. I'm smarter -- and $13 poorer -- for having bought these.",2

59029,The quality of my previous blankets were so much better. This one is not as soft and feels cheap. I will not be buying another one and I have used this brand (they changed their name) blanket for over 15 years. Disappointed does not begin to describe how let down I feel by this brand.,2

61170,After a month of use I noticed that a 15 foot end section was not working. After having a closer look I discovered the wire was damaged from abrasion (wind plus Tree). The part I want to warn users of this product about is that the worn out section of wire sparked and did not blow the fuse. The lights remained on.,2
48409,"Ok, the appliance works great, except the hose gets brittle and breaks. Try to get a new one and the company doesn't sell it directly, have to go through an appliance repair place, even though I assembled the hose on the bissel in the first place. There's no repair place nearby so I'm SOL. So the thing works fine except a cracked hose, which I've tried to patch together with electrical tape that leaks.",2

47463,"Tested it out for about a month - overall found that it was pretty ineffective despite the positive reviews. I had all 4 plugged in different rooms of a 900 sq ft apartment. One in the bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, and one in the bathroom. It seemed to work for the first few days, which is why I'll give it 2 stars. However after about a week/week and a half we saw roaches/ants/other bugs again. At one point, I saw a roach crawling on the wall directly across from where it was plugged in in our bedroom (less than 6 ft away). We also saw ants/roaches in the kitchen despite having it plugged in all the time. We tried moving them around, putting more than 1 in a room, etc but no luck. We're having an exterminator come again today and I'll be looking for a better solution. overall, seems like more of a gimmick than anything",2

I started the first day with 2 pills twice a day to ease into it. The following night I started with 4. Nothing. It wasn’t until day 4 when I had a bm. It’s a joke. I mean, 4 pills at once says enough, not powerful. Everyone is different, just didn’t work for me.",2

Luckily I bought the extended warrantee.,2

67231,"I purchased this blender in July at $90. Looks nice, has plenty of attachments and seemed like a good deal. Used twice a month, it worked fine. Around 6 months in, I began to make smoothies daily. Sometimes twice a day. After a month of this frequent use the motor began grinding and making the screw that holds the attachments come off mid-use. I went online and read how to tighten it up and did that. It lasts a day or two between tightening sand you have to hold the blender or cup on tight so it doesn’t fall off. When I called about the warranty, I was told to find a box to pack it, drive it to a drop off location and once they received it back they would send another. About a 2 week turn around. Because I use this daily, I will be just replacing it instead of dealing with the hassle and I won’t use this brand again.",2
