I have bad anxiety in a lot of situations and choose not to take strong medications that are controlled drugs so I struggle to find things that will keep me calm and panic free. I read about this vitamin on line and was excited to try it. This worked so well! I was so much more calm in situations that would usually trigger me. This gives you a sense of relief and a calmness that a lot of other vitamins and pills I have taken have not. Not only did it make me feel calm but it also has made me feel less depressed and has made me able to live a better quality life. Usually I toss and turn to fall asleep and this has significantly decreased the time it takes to fall asleep and stay asleep. The pills are easy to swallow and does not have a nasty aftertaste.

I switched him to this gradually over the course of a week, mixing his old food and this one together. After getting to full portions of this food, he would get really bad diarrhea. I kept thinking maybe he‚Äôd eaten something else, so kept him on this food but it lasted another couple of days. I switched him cold turkey back to Blue Buffalo and immediately the next morning his stool started to improve. Not sure what he is allergic to, but he definitely didn‚Äôt tolerate this food.

The pole caps break easily. The net doesn‚Äôt even fit around the base of the trampoline. I was unable to get this assembled until my husband returned from a long trip. We just got around to putting it all together after two months. Now it doesn‚Äôt even work and parts are breaking. A waste of money.

6621,I was happy with this cover to begin with but after less than two months it has torn.

12512,The product looks great. However the plastic base smelled very toxic when coffee maker heats up and you can‚Äôt time the percolating process therefore it brewed very week coffee. Percolating is supposed to be timed so people can choose how strong they want their coffe.,1
35426,I regret buying this case because the ipad so easily falls out of the slips that it becomes very annoying. I am looking for a replacement now.,1
11032,"I liked how oversized this product looked. I bought two, one a large and one xl. Both had holes in the seams in different areas. If I could return them I would. Also, if you buy this product WASH before you wear. This product must have had a chemical on it that made me itch and left me with a rash. NOT WORTH THE PRICE FOR POORLY MADE HOODIES!",1

31797,Embarrassing. I am a wedding planner and bought this along with a bubble machine for a bubble send off. It literally would not blow ONE bubble with this solution. Not one. We ended up mixing dish soap with it to make it work even a little.,1
28666,I am rating this way specifically for the iPhone X. I had this exact case for my iPhone 7+ and I liked it so much that I ordered it right away for my new iPhone X. I am very disappointed that when you take the phone with the thin inner case on it does not work for wireless charging. I think anyone who makes accessories for the X should point out that it does not work with wireless charging. Unusable for me. I have two other thin cases that work fine with wireless and even the thick OtterBox does.,1
12781,Not a fan of this at all. I have worn Angel for years and can verify that this does NOT smell like the real deal. Disappointed that it is non returnable,1

18782,"I ordered these bowls from THIS listing and paid the upcharge because I liked the color scheme of the 100 year anniversary edition advertised. It matches the color scheme of my kitchen. The ones I received are different altogether. A different color glass, different color lids, and the worst part is that the set I received regularly retails for $15-20 which means I paid double for them. I'm beyond irritated that I spent the extra money on these and did not get what was advertised in the listing.",1

I have potty trained 3 other children so its not that I do not know what to do.,1
6346,"I really was excited for these but unfortunately I haven't had but a month, I have only used a few times and one of them is messing up. It's choppy or statistics and then causes the earbuds to shut down and flashes red and blue. Not sure why and they came with little info. I haven't used much because they are pretty thick and don't want to stay in my ears. I read the reviews and was worried this might happen so I bought those ear buddy's to go with. But they only helped some. They still want to fall out. So I have only used a few times while at home. But as of the past week I am having a hard time getting the right one to stay on and work. Every video I played was choppy real annoying to listen to. Not sure if I should buy a replacement one or return looks like I only have till February 11th. I just didnt want to upset hubby by returning they was a gift from him. These would be awesome if just a bit smaller and of course the sound was better in the one that is messing up.",1

72654,I got this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old. This car is fun and fast. However during the first ten minutes of use parts broke off and we are no longer able to steer the car. He was very disappointed and so was I. I would think an offroading remote control car would be plenty more durable but this is car is very fragile and parts break easily.

One of the male customers on Amazon gave feedback and called it a nut and bolt and he is exactly right i thought he was just joking when I read his review. He was not joking at all. This little device has a little bolt and you screw the back on. It will not even leave a tiny hole in your garment, it will damage your garment and leave a large hole in it. I telephone the company and told them that it is regulation size and the eagle globe and anchor look really good,but the back of this device is not for a collar. Do yourself a favor as I will do, go to an Army surplus store in your area and all the branches are there. The lady that I spoke to at this company didn't really give a rip.

First one wasn't very bright and would blink off and on by itself. I had been having some wifi problems with the 2.4g channel, so I thought that that was causing problems with the lamp. My ISP replaced the wifi router and I'm still having problems with the lamp. Today I plugged in the second lamp and it works without any problems and is much brighter. Dumb me - it took 6 weeks to figure out that the the first lamp was bad and now I'm stuck with it. The second lamp works well and I'm happy with it but since quality control and customer service is non-existent, I don't recommend this product.",2

While I see they tried to do a good job on the instruction manuel it's not clear enough that it explains the complicated little maneuvers to remove the screen and the little ribbon connections safely and to reattach the little covers and parts. A youtube video is a must. I don't recommend this kit. It's very easy to bend a little pin on the ribbon connector sockets and ruin your phone.

127181,"The machine is wonderful. It is fast, boots instantly and there is plenty of memory and hard disk space. I use it for engineering work (CAD and structural calculations) and it is replacing a previous two monitor HP rig. I work with two programs simultaneously and the monitor is fantastic at that. My only complaint is the input devices HP includes with it. The mouse is awful for CAD. The no-button design is a nightmare for dragging and dropping with CAD applications. It had to be replaced with a wired HP mouse. The keyboard is nice and small, but after a few weeks it started to repeat keys. I contacted, and spent a considerable time with, HP support on this issue. After the support session it improved; but after several days the key repetitions came back. So I finally replaced the keyboard with a Logitech mechanical keyboard and I am happy with it. So now the machine is a dream! I am an old school computer user and enjoy the tactile feedback of the mechanical keyboard. The fan is certainly a bit noisy; but it only turns on from time to time, so it is not a concern to me. The sound is truly better than other all in ones; but, if like me you take music seriously, get a set of external loudspeakers.",4

141855,I've used it once and overall think it's fine. I like that it's stretchy material so I can pull it up over my son's car seat. I wish it had a strap in the front so I can pull it down and block the sun from coming down through the front. I'm sure I'll find a way of using it that works for us and I like it well enough so far.

Windows picked up the device on both systems, I did not need to use the included CD to load the drivers. The build quality of the cable seems good and the plastic used for the connectors is solid. My only problem with this adapter is the COM port number change each time to attach the USB port to the PC. The serial plugs have little numbered labels on them, but those don't help since the COM port numbers seem to be assigned randomly to each connector. I don't find it a hard problem to work around. I just run puTTY on each port to see which ones are talking. This works fine for my purposes, but it would be nice if the COM ports were consistent.",4

137577,"I read the reviews before buying this rug and noted the inconsistency in vibrancy. Some folks said the rug was more saturated than the pictures, while a few said they were disappointed by how dull the colors were. My rug arrived today and after rolling it out, I also thought it was on the dull side. But overall I liked it. The funny thing is that when I came back to the living room later in the day, the colors looked much more saturated. I thought maybe it was the difference in lighting - natural vs LED. But, after walking around the rug, I saw that the colors look different from different angles and depending on how the threads are angled. I‚Äôm attaching three photos: 1) saturated side 2) less saturated 3) less saturated after I dragged my feet across the rug in a couple areas. I‚Äôm guessing it will be more consistent if I vacuum over it? Outside of that interesting issue, it looks exactly as expected :)",4

Update: I was able to wear this hair from mid July to early September. The photos show the hair from initial install to last week on use in order. Hair comes back to life after each wash but starts to get more and more tangles. The hair sheds like crazy the hair wasn't as full as I like but was well worth the price. I will buy again,4

The work bench itself is not the highest quality, and I was worried that the pegs wouldn‚Äôt fit correctly. I received the pegs and to my relief they fit. They do take some wiggling and force to get them into the pegboard, but they work perfectly. They are durable and sturdy enough that they hold all the tools that I have mounted with them, but pliable enough that it is possible to get them into peg boards that aren‚Äôt the highest quality. These hooks will probably outlast the work bench itself.",4

It‚Äôs a lot heavier than I expected. I was expecting it on the day it arrived. When I saw a package on my porch, I picked it up and didn‚Äôt know what it was because it was much heavier than I expected. Not sure how much lighter the titanium version is but it may be worth saving up for. My pack is heavy enough without adding more weight than necessary. Remember. Everything adds up. Ounces = pounds, and pounds = pain. Keep plenty of twigs handy to get it going. And keep plenty of sticks handy once it‚Äôs lit. It does burn through sticks quickly.",4

The spout instead of a straw was also a major plus for easy cleaning. Unfortunately, this product had a nauseating odor when we got it. I ordered two and both had such a strong smell that it took countless washing, air drying and soaking in vinegar and soap for me to even consider putting a beverage in it. Several weeks later it finally seemed to dissipate and is now being used regularly without any problems. This little bottle would be absolutely perfect had it not been for the chemical odor. I wish I could reccomend it but it depends on how fast you need to use it. I don't think I would order again but i love the design and feel like it is safe to use now that the odor is gone.",3

I was pleasantly surprised that the plot was not half bad, and the characters were even interesting in their own right. Personally, the polyamory was a bit uncomfortable to read for me. I was hoping the main character would just choose one, the wolf-shifter preferably! I have not pursued the rest of the series, despite the compelling plot and characters.

I turned it inside out and washed it by hand in a tub of soapy water, and that helped some.

But this shaper did not let me sweat at all for one hour of lifting weights at the gym. I usually sweat profusely but this did not give me any as far as I can see. Very disappointed and it fits loose on the back for a small shaper. I will keep it though for jogging in the summer when I want to have loose fitting shaper. I wish they made extra small size for someone like me. I've never been disappointed in slimming products except for this one. However, it is comfortable if you don't want anything that is tight and it is a nice thin material. It also gives me a little bit of breast lift. So I concluded that I will use adjustable material for my waist so that it will fit right. This shirt is not adjustable.",3

EDIT**** I am adding a star based off of how good and responsive their Customer Service Team was. My charger ended up not working and they immediately emailed me and offered different solutions to see if my charger would work using various different methods.
