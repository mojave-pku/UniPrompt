199658,"I purchased this tracker due to my daughter being a new driver and concerns about her safety. It took seconds to install and I am not a tech wiz. I dowloaded the app to my phone and can also track using my laptop. Within minutes from installation, the tracker synced with the app and I was able to track her car. It allows me to see her speed, received notifications if there is sharp turning or braking, and also provides a history of where she has been. I can get exact coordinates of her location and times which has already come in handy in a big way. We received a call from the police department that there was an accident and the person who was driving hit another vehicle and drove away. The vehicle was similar to my daughter's and she was in the same town when the accident occurred! I was able to pull up the tracking history and see she was not in the same location where the accident occurred at that time through the tracker. Also, her vehicle did not show any damage thankfully. The tracker saved us a lot of hassle and concern. PS She is unaware the tracker is on her vehicle. If for some reason it is removed, we would be notified as well as the unit will send a message that it has been tampered with. Overall, very pleased with this product.",5

174698,Especially for anyone who might be in an abusive relationship or has experienced one in the past. Good book and would recommend it. It's difficult to come away and not get something out of it and how persons can easily get entrenched in abusive relationships and the patterns that go with it. KP,5
194368,I am about an 18w and i ordered the 2xl and it fit perfect. One strap didn’t want to fit in the designed hole so i flipped it around to go in the other end and it worked. I am very pleased with this bathing suit and received a lot of compliments,5

165940,I wish I bought these sooner. I noticed a significant savings in just a month as I used to leave to lights burning 24/7 in the front and back yards.

I was worried about the shorts being to big if i ordered the medium.. or the top being to small if I ordered the small, as I am petite and busty. Took a chance on the small and looked hella amazing in it! My arms felt comfortable, and I was able to keep them on without cutting it like follower customers have stated. Love the fact that you can adjust the top to fit your bust! Quality looks amazing and not cheap either. I’m critical in attire and I must say this was nice! Buy it.

9733,In December I purchased two LxTek five pack 952XL in anticipation of a planned distribution for a small nonprofit mission group that i work with. After some delay the printed project got underway. When printing began I discovered that only one out of the four 952XL black cartridge was functional. A 75% failure rate is much too high for any product. Unfortunately due to the delays in the project my time for recourse through Amazon Prime also passed. I love the idea of reused/re-manufactured cartridges but there should be some checks on re-usability before marketing.,1
16382,"Bought in October...Burned up in January. The blender worked great....until it didn't. It was used once a day from October to January. Each morning, I made a Rocket-Fuel Latte. No ice, no nuts, nothing dense. One morning, it began to make funny noises, the blender slowed down, and as I turned it off, it began to smoke and produce a very odd smell. Braun customer service seems to be set up to deny claims. I still don't have a new blender-- they only want to give me the bottom part, but the things that turn the blades are locked up, too. Still in limbo using a cheap blender from WalMart.",1

5685,Not worth a buck. Just awful.,1
29395,"Definitely not what I thought I was getting. It does not cover as much as the pictures show (and I have a short torso), it rolls down, and didn't smooth or flatten anything. Instead it made me look round and pregnant. I ordered a 3X and you can tell they are made for smaller people, not truly for bigger girls that have a little more to smooth out. Very disappointed.",1
30774,Horrid product. So disappointed that I chose this over a new iPad. iBooks (iPad) Have much better features and you don't have to deal with crappy advertising blasted all over the home screen as the fire tablet apparently does. Bought another for gift and am embarrased to give it now.,1
37991,"I contacted the seller and will update this once they respond...if they do. I ordered two strands of lights. On the first one, the last 3 feet didn't light up. This was annoying, but I was planning to hide that portion of the lights anyway. On the second strand, ONLY the first 6 feet lit up. That means almost 90 feet DIDN'T.",1

21765,The product is not what was advertised! Looks like it was from $1 store,1
12120,This order was dropped in the middle of my driveway. We are in a weather pattern of pop up showers everyday. When I returned home I found the package not safely secured by the garage or the covered front patio. Absolutely unacceptable and Amazon the delivery Person should be fired and held accountable,1

Not comfortable at all. I bought because someone said she was a nurse and wore them with no pain during clinicals... I don’t know how. No arch support at all. Don’t waste your money",1

17531,I had almost not expectations while buying this product yet it still managed to disappoint me. Incredible. Don't buy anyone anything from Gildan. It's like they didn't tailor these for humans. I would like to see a single person that these t-shirts fit well. Just don't buy them. please.,1

27135,This was a BOXED SET. Supposedly with multiple books. I paid full price for the set and only received one paper back. Very deceitful. Dont buy from this seller.,1
17161,"This is the tenth book, and honestly I am finished with the series and the author. These ""books"" compare to chapters in other authors novels. Consider this, at around $3 each, if you have purchased part one to part ten, you are now in this for $30 and the story isn't finished. I purchase a novel because I want to watch the characters develop, grow, see them overcome hardship and conflict, and I want to escape into their story for however long it takes. I actually enjoy a number of authors that use multiple books to tell a story. Meghan March is a master of this. I wish Hannah the best on her literary journey but I won't be following her or her writing anymore.",1
24582,"We looked all over Amazon for a new set of luggage and finally settled on this set after comparing price and reviews. Our main concern was the durability of the set. Well our fears were realized on our 1st trip. The luggage was nice and light, rolled well, had great space inside but when we picked up our luggage at the baggage claim, the largest one was missing a wheel. It had completely ripped off of the case, exposing the fabric inside the shell. The middle one lost one of the bumpers on it's spine, exposing two metal studs. Luckily United had 2 new suitcases that they swapped out right then and there for us. It just seemed like the better way to go instead of filing a claim and purchasing this set a 2nd time. We really wanted to like the set too...pretty bummed at the quality.",1
30608,Worthless and it doesn’t work,1

11741,"I never received this product. It was delivered to my US postal service mailbox outside my house. My mail carrier said Amazon is not authorized to deliver to mailbox ,,only to door.

20535,The bands are not strong enough. I’m a mid level athlete / fitness female and the black band which is supposed to be the hardest / strongest went around my legs and gave me VERY little resistance in squats and lunges. Poor quality gliding discs...scratched along the floor and did not give smooth transitions.,1
15121,"I did a lot of shopping around and decided on this light because it was the cheapest of the ones with the features I wanted. Not till it arrived with no battery did I find in listing that battery was not included. Perhaps that’s my fault because I didn’t read thoroughly, but I am still pissed because now I have the light I wanted but still can’t use it till I spend more money",1

(I have a desk job) I was sent a replacement pair, but I've been afraid to wear them, as I don't want the same thing to happen. 🤞 Update - I've changed my rating to 2 stars, as the replacement pair have broken as well. They lasted 2 days. Very disappointed.",2
60188,Order at least one size up. Material is cheap. Stiff and you can't take photos or type emails as advertised.,2
65554,I hate to review anything especially when I have received it a few hours back. Two stars because the packaging is either very poor or I have received an open package. That too one day later than what was promised.,2
48149,"These are HUGE! My 2 1/2 year old wears an 8, but they are fitting snug. I ordered a size 9 (double checked their size chart), and they are HUGE. See pics for comparison (you can see the 8 and 9 imprinted on each shoe).",2

Unfortunately, the faucet head has now failed twice and the replacement took over a month to arrive, leaving me with a barely functional faucet.

66584,"You get what you pay for with this record player. Turntable itself feels light and made of a thin metal. The arm is metal which is nice but the lever to adjust the needle height dosnt work, causing the needle to fall on its own. It assembles easily and plays out of the box. At lower volumes it sounds good with the included speakers but at higher volumes it falls apart, so I would only suggest to use it in smaller rooms. Also out of the box one of the speakers play much quieter than the other, after switching them and getting new wires nothing seems to work, and with no balance control on the system I may need to get new speakers all together. I wouldn’t recommend this record player, all in all very cheaply made, can’t imagine it will withstand the long term",2

66870,Not what I expected ... but I gave it as a gift,2
76796,With all the great reviews I thought this would be a great bath bomb. Instead I found these had little to no scent to them at all. They don't fizz very well either. They do have some moisturizing ability and some do change the water colors but it can't make up for the lack of scent in these things.,2

I have had my 4th generation iPad since 2012 and it has always been in mint condition... until I got this cover with the keyboard. I discovered a crack on my screen this morning, and I'm pretty bummed. I've never dropped my iPad and am super gentle with it. If my iPad was newer, I'd be much more upset - but I'm just upset that I bought this cover and now my screen is cracked. I can only guess that it's because of the keyboard and no cushion in between the screen and the frame of the keyboard? Who knows.",2
77335,I did not expect this to be such ridiculously flimsy plastic: it’s like something you’d get in a pack fir birthday favors. Not high quality and in my opinion both with nearly $12.,2

I have a 400 mbS internet speed from my provider, my phone is steady at 320 mbs speed and laptop does not exceed 200 mbs speed, so, my phone is faster than the laptop. I tried getting help from Dell since at first it didn't exceed 49 mbs and they helped me get to 200, then they turned me over to the software department which sold me a package of $150, service and software. After almost 2 hours with them on phone and laptop they actually slowed my speed even more and then admitted that the laptop does not have the capacity to go any faster, I was fuming. BOTTOM LINE... NOT WORTH THE MONEY",2

I would have preferred to pay a “used” price for this book. Otherwise the instruction inside the book on drawing heads and hands is excellent. The book mostly focuses on heads, so if you’re looking more for hand instruction I might recommending trying another book. The book covers a lot on proportions and different expressions.",2

45056,"I’m confused by the good reviews on this book. I will say that some of the author’s comments are good enough to assist the reader in their own reflection, but most are plain, lacking insight, and feel rushed...and some are just stupid. Take February 8th for example, where the author says “The next time someone gets upset near you - crying, yelling, breaking something, being pointed or cruel - watch how quickly this statement will stop them cold: ‘I hope this is making you feel better.’ Because, of course, it isn’t.” Face palm. There is nothing remotely Stoic about responding with sarcasm to someone who is upset. I like the structure and premise behind the book so much that I keep wanting it to get better. But I can’t help but feel like I’m reading the musings of an amateur.",2

They asked for first initial, last initial then middle initial and they obviously should have put the middle initial in the middle but we got ours as the last letter.

I gave 4 stars because it must be attached to a hard part of the pack and play. If I try to tighten it on the fabric side, it cannot grip with the weight of the mobile causing it to hang down wayyy to close to baby. Not really a big deal, works fine if you attach to hard area.",4
121657,"These are nice sheets, They washed well and didn't really look wrinkled after drying but they do wrinkle once used on the bed like most other sheets. Still a nice set they are soft and have a nice feel to them. They fit my foam mattress good without slipping off. Would recommend.",4
142611,I LOVED how easy it was to put this together. Usually my husband and I cannot be in the same room after we put furniture together this was a breeze. The only problem was that the king size frame was just a tad to small for the mattress so we just put the little part that doesn't fit at the head so it's not as noticable.,4

154683,"First off, I didn't love the smell. It wasn't bad but it reminded me of something that's medicated. I was disappointed with the size of the bottle thinking that it won't last long but I only needed a small dime size to get a good lather. After drying my hair, it felt so soft and silky. I don't think it's because I changed to a different shampoo because I do that pretty regularly so that I don't get buildup from the same product. I haven't used it long enough to see if it would help with my hair loss yet. I'll update when I run out.",4

132626,"I have a young, year old cat who loves this toy. Often before bed, I toss it around, and I love the exercise he gets. I noticed he sleeps better, as well. Sometimes, I attach two of the feather bunches. One that is soft and fluffy, and the other type that is thinner and more rigid. He loves the combo. I can't fault the company for the beating the feathers take, as he is pretty rough with it. However, my frustration has been with the wand. The first one I had lasted about six months before it had issues. The second one didn't even last a month, so now I am on my third one in two months. I am giving this third one a try, and if I have the same issue, I will start looking at a competitor. I really do like the quality of the feather, which makes this choice difficult. I do have to give props for the price, if it were more expensive, I would have already gone to a competitor.",4

Remove the white paper from decal and place the decal on your desired location use credit card to smooth out and peel transfer paper off making sure your letters are flat.

Overall, nice to use. I initially reviewed this lower, but upon support from HP Customer Service, realized that my printer was shipped with an ink cartridge that was old / dried out. So the poor printing was simply a bad ink cartridge. My only criticism is that this was clearly aged inventory in Amazon's warehouse - the printer showed with a sale date that was a year ahead of my purchase (and HP nicely updated that with the warranty information) and the ink was close to it's expiration date.

120664,Very nice product no issues putting it together. Everything is solid metal. Not sure why anyone would complain about a plastic screw holding the lightning jack.

So small I had to use a magnifying glass just to read them. Works how advertised but I couldn’t get the remote (which was bigger than I expected) to work until I charged everything fully for a few hours, i does have an indicator light and flashes while charging , I had to sorta plug the dc cable in just right and move it around so that I could make full contact in order for it the charge ( took me about a day to get this thing fully charged ) . Very soft and smooth texture , The head swivels in a circular motion which I didn’t even know it did, but not to be too graphic it just isn’t strong enough to do that while it’s in use , not a very powerful vibration either but it is quiet .

83499,I have read all the wonderful books in this family but I'm sad to say that this one was just good not great. What happened to dialogue between the couple - most of the relationship was in their thoughts not in what they said. What happened to bringing in the family members and the fun of their dialogue. What happened to make the heroine such a whiner - the constant I'm not good enough. Not to mention the contradictions on what's said in ome chapter such as the great mother that leaves her son alone overnight by himself while shes on a date.

112607,I have to take it off and clean the insider of the protector and the watch face weekly. I go to the gym everyday and sweat gets behind the protector and interferes with the touch responsiveness. It definitely saves the watch face though.,3
104692,It looks great but I'm super concerned by the smell. I haven't felt confident to put food in it yet. I washed it a few times but it has a strong plastic smell still. What the heck is out-gassing?,3
115828,Didn’t really like the case but only a personal preference issue.,3
106526,It definitely transfers files at a very fast speed for 3.0. And it is definitely capable of fast charging. However it is constantly dinging and connecting and disconnecting every other second if it's ever touched while in use. I have to sit my phone down still on a countertop or something and not hold it in my hand. If I'm trying to transfer a file I need to do that also and just touch the screen gently to not move it or it will completely disconnect and try and reconnect which would ruin any file transfers and progress and will mess up the charging as well. I feel like it's not plugging in deep enough into the phone like the original cable does.,3
94206,Another in the series form this author. Okay read.,3
85341,"I've wanted to try menstrual cups for a while and finally got one! I was super excited to use it but ran into so many uncomfortable bumps along the way I'm a little timid to use it again. I found the only way I could remove it was while I was laying on my back. I relaxed my muscles as the removal instructions told me when i tried standing up, but even though I could feel the rim it was like it kept slipping out of my reach every time I tried to grip it! This panicked me because I was in public and couldn't just lay on the stall floor to fish it out. Also, the cup seemed to disappear up there the first few days (my cervix height changed which is normal but made the whole removal time a pain). If anything I'll try the soft cup because i did notice slightly uncomfortable pressure on my bladder making it near impossible to use the bathroom. I don't want to give up on saalt though!",3
94333,"Maybe I missed the description, but I just wanted sheets of animal stickers. What I received was a book, with sticker pages through out, that you stick the animals (they are numbered) on pages in the book (ie. a farm picture that you stick chickens, pigs, etc. on). Bummed it wasn't just the stickers.",3
92637,I never received the bracelet. I kept forgetting to inform you all. and the Necklace turn dark..Tarnished..,3
103250,The range of unit is limited to 6-13 ft so make sure you have mounting location that will be in that range otherwise you may want to consider unit without front controls that you can place close to AC.,3
116490,Not the quality I was looking for. A piece of Junk! Definitely did not worth the list price.,3
106537,I am 5’7” and these shrank way too much. They shrank about 2” in the length. I bought a medium. They also now have a hole in the inseam. I have only had them for 2 1/2 months. Not happy,3
110203,"The carafe isn't compatible with my keurig 2.0, but the pod worked fine",3
82538,"This thing STINKS! Outside of that, the tello fits perfectly in it. But the smell is awful!",3
119097,"It's cute, but the picture shows little feet, and there are no little feet. I am sad that there are no little feet. Pretty sure my kid doesn't care about them though.",3
113782,"I like the service with this company...fast and efficient. The candy is no all that good. The strawberry flavored ones of this same type are DELICIOUS, but the cherry flavored ones, I won’t be ordering again",3
87193,"Weak material, croch ripped at seam",3
91332,"I really wanted the bigger sleeve type connector clips, but though i would give these a try. They move around, so on this one cable I am using it's not really helping to keep the connector i. I'm dealing with it, but should have bought the other type.",3
103697,the size was good for carrying stuff to the range the holders for the pistol magazines were way to small. the large ones may be for rifle magazines.,3
80804,"giving it a 3 simply because, like another reviewer mentioned, the LG dryer has a grate at the bottom and this didn’t do well at catching that build-up. i’m sure it works great with other brands (or types if this particular LG is the only one that has a grate) but for me, no go. i got angry at it and ended up trying to use a long straw cleaner...don’t try that unless you strap it to your hand - it’s now hanging out at the bottom of the grate cuz i dropped it and all i really wanna do is dry my sheet so i can go to bed. such is life.",3
86739,About 40% seeded and are now outside growing. Not sure how the crop turns out yet.,3
110726,To seller; Excited to use this product as it was recommended by my stylist. I was disappointed to see that both the shampoo and conditioner had leaked when I opened the box. Amazon didn't give me the option to contact you privately to see how to handle this. Thanks.,3
