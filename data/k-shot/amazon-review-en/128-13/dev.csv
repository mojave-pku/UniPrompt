77820,"I had a heck of a time getting this unit to take a write. For some reason simply putting the unit into write mode would not allow it to take new programming. After a bunch of fiddling (and almost returning these) I discovered that if you put the boards into write mode first, then start writing a new sketch, and then press the boot button WHILE arduino ide/mongoose/etc is trying to connect, then the IDE will connect and start slashing the board. Also to note, this only seemed to be a problem on my windows computer. When I tried writing the board from Arduino IDE on Linux, simply putting the board into write mode seemed to work as expected. (I have no idea why) One more note, I could not get these boards to be recognized USB devices on Mac at all. Apparently there is a known driver signing issue between the driver for these, and Mac's running OS X 10.13 or higher, that to-date, has yet to be fixed. I tried every recommendation I could find online, nothing worked, so if you want to program these boards with a Mac, I would look at some other kind of board or imaging computer.",2

Probably. Possibly. It is not sturdy for two regular adults. My husband gladly takes credit for the bent supporting rods underneath, and I let him. But, really, it's just super weak material and normal activities by normal sized adults caused both the top (by headboard) and bottom (by foot board) rods to bend. And in a weird place-- like 3/4 of the way down the rod! Not in the middle (like I could justify, because we cuddle together in the middle of the bed). And we'd only had the frame for less than 3 months when the first one bent. We just noticed the footboard one was bent at six months. I contacted the designers listed here via their website, and they directed me to the manufacturers, whom I never heard from after submitting my issue on their separate website and requested a replacement bar (at the time of the request, only one was bent, AND I offered to pay to replace it. Never heard back.) So, I'm shopping for a new bed. And husband is proud of himself. Probably worth the price of the bed just for the cloud 9 feeling he's riding high on...",2

The problem is since they are tempered glass, no matter how you install them you will see rainbows in the screen as you are looking through the edge of the screen protector. If they were the proper size the edge of the protector would not be over a part of the screen you want to look at and these would be great. But 1 star because they are unusuable in my opinion",2

But in practice this parachute is so small that it barely catch any wind. You barely feel any resistance. All it does is make you try to run fast, to get it catching the wind. This is fun for 20 seconds, then you are tired from the running. It is not just my opinion, but my kids as well. They play soccer and in good shape, and didn't feel like this product added anything to the training. I think it is a waste of your money to buy this thinking you will get good use out of it in a training session. I rarely put down a product, but it is simply not living up to its claims. Save your money and get something else instead. If you already bought one, try to return it. Otherwise just tie a GI-Joe doll to it (or Barbie) and throw it from a high place for some parachute fun.

I spent a lot of time troubleshooting my whole TIG setup until I finally took one out, plugged the center hole, and tried blowing through it. I could barely move any air through it. Turns out one of the screens got clogged. I do not have any contamination in my line or any reason for it to get this way, nor did I ever have the problem with CK and other products I've used over the years.

From the photo and price, I wasn't entirely sure whether this would do the job protecting my phone. Well, I've had it for over a year now, and so far no damage has been done at all.

191692,These are awesome for folks that have to put these on alone and especially if you are using your non-dominant hand. They go on very easily and there is plenty of room inside ( maybe a little too much) but they stay put and do not leak. I highly recommend.,5

189277,"I really love these candles. They are unscented, as promised, and leave no wax. What I loved the most about these candles is that there is no leftover wax to clean up and very little smoke that the candle produces. From my personal experience, the burning time for one candle is 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",5

187585,"I ordered this particular remote/e-collar because it had two collars that could work off of one remote for my my 2 year old Golden Retrievers, Finn and Nora. We do a lot of trail running and it has worked great. I usually use the vibrate or sound, and have not even needed to resort to the shocker! But, the most awesome thing about purchasing this e-collar is the incredible customer support I received when I called them to inquire about replacing the remote, which I lost! They sent me a new remote at no extra charge! Amazing! I would highly recommend this system and a friend had already purchased one at my suggestion for his Lab. Thank you SO much for this great product and wonderful support!",5

183180,"I left my phone on top of my car and felt it fall off while I was on the highway. I watched three cars run it over and felt my heart sink when I heard a loud crack every time...ran in and picked it up when the cars passed...and my phone is UNSCATHED. The case itself just has a crack in one of the corners but it's barely noticable...absolutely the BEST case I've ever had. Not to mention it's really thin and light, and aesthetically pleasing too. The ridges have a rubbery feel to them too, giving it a great grip. Five stars.",5

187835,"Arrived as expected, lights up very brightly, not sure about the strange color it casts on my plants but hope it is what they will need to survive being brought in for the winter.",5
189761,"You want to know something...these little speakers are the bomb! I can take them with me wherever I go. The carry case is perfect, the USB cable is just right. They are simple to use (they talk to you), and for what they are the sound isn't that bad. You could easily spend 4 times the cost of these speakers to get a portable speaker that you are most likely not going to enjoy schlepping around (and ISN'T stereo!). These speakers do a pretty good job of separating the sound - for the audiophile you are going to hear drop-offs in the the upper ranges and it's far from true bass, but when you go away for the weekend, for example, and want to bring tunes with you, these guys are the bomb!",5
197706,"I love this carrier and so does my cat. She hated her hard sided carrier, so l decided to try a soft sided one. I love being able to slip my hand in and petting her! I have also received a couple of compliments on the looks of the carrier.",5

162734,"I’ve only had it one day so I can’t say, yet, how this product is in the gaining weight department but I can say that this is the best tasting protein powder I have ever tried and if I see results this will be the only product I will ever use. You can still tell it is a protein powder (duh, you’re not going to get away from that) but it’s not strong or over powering, it doesn’t have an after taste, and it really does taste like chocolate milk without being too sweet. With milk it’s almost like a milkshake and with water it’s like watered down chocolate milk. So far I’m extremely impressed.",5
198070,"Got these for travel as they pack easily. Fit nicely, wear well.",5

170303,"I will update this as I use the cables but at first glance, they look really nice and appear to be of good quality. I have had the same 25' lifetime guaranteed cables for 30 years but wanted something shorter. I liked the tweed covered cables because they do not appear to tangle as much as regular rubber cables. These got great reviews so i figured I would give them a try. I like that they came with velcro ties to secure them when not in use. My one critique is that I wish that the ties were designed to stay on the cable when unsecured. This is a not a big issue. One just needs to remember to wrap the tie around the cable after releasing it.",5

181585,"""This is my fourth fitness tracker (all brands are different). I don't want to buy an expensive band, and it's important to decide which one is best for you. In the previous band, I was having trouble syncing to my mobile phone. The battery lasted for one day and the reading was not accurate. This fitness band surpassed all the other bands I bought. The first time you connect to the phone and set it up, no problem. Very easy to use and easy to use. I received the watch on Monday night and it is still going on - surprisingly he has been running for 7 days, can monitor my heart rate and sleep, I can use fitness elements; exercise, walk and bike. I found this watch to be very reliable, especially when I was working at school, now I don't need to worry about the battery affecting me. I like to sync easily with my phone and receive messages via my watch. My new fitness watch is very satisfying and will definitely recommend it.""",5

188388,Laser pointer works really well! The other flashlight feature is just a bright spot light. I think it tried to advertise being able to see previous blood stains with it but it’s just a bright flash light.,5
196061,"This short film grabbed my attention immediately and had me in suspense, it definitely needs to be a full feature film, it keeps you wanting more. Also, the quality of it was awesome which is also a plus in my book, great project. Corey B",5

175410,"When I received this comforter, my sister-in-law gave me one of her comforter. I thought the one she gave me would be better than this one I bought from Amazon but no, I was wrong. The quality is better than expected. I was surprised that it is actually EXTRA PLUSH so it provides extra comfort and softness. I love it so much because i sleep a lot. Also, it is light weighted yet very warm so I'm very happy with my comforter. The only thing is that it is very white and I worry that I might stain it so a cover might be my next purchase.",5

173996,Very well made. Very sturdy. Nice rich color. Plenty of room in the main compartments for 15 inch lap top and files. The interior pockets have are ample enough for me for additional items.The two exterior pockets are deep and and wider than I expected allowing more places to put your extra like cell phone etc. The stiching on this bag is very well done. Seems to me this bag should last a very long time. Did I mention it just plain looks great!,5
169442,Keeps the bugs off my face while mowing around bushes and trees or just working in the garden. I highly recommend this product if you hate bug bites!,5
188113,Purchased this case and was pleasantly surprised with strength of the magnets holding the flap/cover in place. There is definitely an orientation that works better. When done so the felt side is outward - the magnet hold is strong. When the glossy side is outward - the magnetic hold is less strong. I think this has to do with the nature of the open end being folded inward vs outward with the latter.,5
194289,The pack came neatly packaged and I am a huge fan of the coffee!! So convenient that it doesn't need to be refrigerated so I can order online. The coffee itself is delicious and the nitro makes it super smooth to drink. I'm also lactose intolerant so the oat milk latte has been a game changer... soo happy about it!,5
172909,"I just got these and used them this weekend to block out the Karaoke noise coming from a Bar on my block. I am used to City noise, but this is a whole other nuisance. I have a white noise machine that blocks out the (very bad) singing but I couldn't block out the bass. I put these on and in combo with the white noise, I could barely hear it. It was enough to allow me to go to sleep. Of course, these are not meant to be cozy for sleeping and you can only sleep on your back, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do. When you are desperate to sleep, you will literally try anything. I'm sure they look stupid, but I don't care because I was asleep. They fit my head tightly, so I'm sure if I wore them for a long time I would get a headache but the bar closes at 1am. I just woke up in the middle of the night and removed them. Works for me.",5

This one does not strip my color and my color lasts much longer than with the other natural shampoos I’ve used in the past! I am sensitive to certain smells and I was unsure of how I would like this Lavendar smell! I love it, it is not over powering, just the right amount of scent.

Looking closer, and I saw that there's also a mark on the cardboard tube it came in, so I'm guessing it happened during shipping.

Off to a disappointing start, but will update review after a few weeks of use. Update July 2019: Failed when we needed it most. Despite a relatively new battery and monthly check-ins, it never triggered an alarm when there was an actual leak. The entire bottom of the cabinet was soaked and the leak detector was found floating in it... useless.",1

The fit is great & they seem warm, but if they are basically disposable socks, what good are they? Wish I could get a refund. Would not recommend.",1
10780,"It has a good size, but be careful when saving big files. It has a “safe” feature that blocks the pen drive and it turns to be useless. Unfortunately, it happened to me in the first use. What got me very upset is that I had to pay for The shipping to have it checked and eventually to get a refund. It cost me almost 50% of what I paid for the item in the first place! Most companies send a reverse shipping code so you don’t have to pay for it, specially when it’s a falty item or an issue that is not the user’s falt. Anyways, a couple of weeks later I got a replacement shipped, but amazingly I also had to pay for importing fees as SanDisk decided to ship a new one from the US and declared the price for customs (it was a replacement, and there was nothing in the box saying it was a replacement. Customs just charged as if I had just bought a new item full price!) Does it works? It works. Would I buy again? Probably not from Sandisk, since the extra price I had to paid I could have bought 2 of these.",1

17323,You'll be lucky if you get them. They deliberately sent me XLR cables instead because they monetarily ran out of stock instead of delaying my order. Couldn't return them in time so now I'm stuck with $40+ worth of the wrong cables. This is NOT the first time either. I order TS they send me TRS. I order TRS I invariably get some TS cables.

There is a quick connect part at the lower end that can be pulled from its brass counterpart even when it feels solid. Rated for 4000 psi and used with a 2500 psi machine.

16055,"Where I do start with the issues: The table is made of literally the thinnest metal possible. Torquing the screws literally bends the metal inwards. It's not even made of sheet metal. Also, rust and dents every where. China steel/chinesium (if it is steel) Screw holes on one part of the table are not properly aligned with their respective part. I have tried flipping parts all around and trying new combinations but to no avail. The instructions being garbage do not help either. (See photo showing misalignment. The horizontal bar is slanted) Lastly, missing screws. Even if I were to misalign the holes on the table and try to screw them in, I cant, because about 5-6 out of 24 hex bolts are missing. (2 missing M6 x 55, and 5 missing M6 x 35, missing Allen key) My recommendation - get a used desk for much cheaper.",1

125964,"Definitely fun... got it to relax myself and absolutely it helped a lot. It felt too soft and the breasts were plump.

It is a very tough cam though. I hit a 2x6 rafter beam at almost full throttle and all I had to do was re-focus the camera lens. Looking back, I should have just not used the factory mount and de-soldered the pins and just wired it straight in and used foam tape to mount it.",4

It works well where I have it beside the couch and wall. The brightness is nice, I would like it if it had a slightly brighter light, for my own needs, but it works just fine and would recommend it to others for a side lamp with shelves!! I really like this product.",4

150356,"I could not give it a higher score as I found to small to fit my D3400 and lens. I returned it and got the 300 instead, I like what I saw to see if the 300 would give me the room I need for my Camara and hiking needs. Loved the pockets and light feel",4
147661,They are good for the price. Easy install. The yellow is very 3k in color but not as bright as I expected. They created less light than my halogens. They look good though.,4

133627,"I had used the Valspar Chalky spray paint and loved it - unfortunately it seems to have been discontinued so when I saw this product I was excited. I bought 12 cans in 3 colors to finish a few projects I had. I used the serenity blue on a cedar chest. The first can clogged halfway through the can and couldn't be unclogged. Additionally, the paint is very thin and even with light coats has a tendency to run. In order to cover fully it took 5 coats. On a positive note, the final color and product in very pretty. I have 2 colors and projects left and I am afraid that I will encounter the same issue with clogging (the other issues I can work around). Updated - contacted Rust-Oleum - They attributed the clogging to the need for more shaking before using and offered to replace or refund me for the wasted cans. Customer service rep. was very nice.",4
137383,"Good looking containers. I bought two of them and one is holding up well while on the other one, a corner of the wood cracked and split wide open. I am disappointed by that. I am puzzled by what happened.",4
132726,Nose was slightly raw by the end of the box. Wish they offered these with lotion.,4
123445,"Over all I love this case so much! The silicone is soft and sturdy, it doesn’t make it much bigger than the phone already is. My main issue is the condition of the case itself. The first time I purchased this case the paint was damaged and off center. Not too noticeable but still a let down. After the case got messed up by my friend’s house rabbit I decided to buy another one. The second case arrived in perfect condition. The paint wasn’t scratched or where it wasn’t supposed to be. I was extremely content. But after trying to put it on my phone I realized it didn’t fit. I’m not sure if they sent me the normal 8 version but the camera cut out cut out my camera so I’m buying the case again and hoping and praying it works this time. Third times the charm. Besides that. I’ve received so many compliments and smiles from my phone case. I think the only reason I would recommend it to someone or buy it again in this case is because of its authenticity and originality. You can’t find this case many places.",4
158806,"Totally great product for a phone stand. However the ""flexible"" USB-C port makes it so placing you phone on the stand is a battle with geometry. I spend too much time trying to line up the phone perfectly with the port. Also no fast charging is a huge let down.",4
138856,Works well - easy to use.,4
123264,"it felt very stiff, which i didn’t like. and the seeming on the edges looked very cheap.",4
153583,Bought these for light duty hiking on good trails in warm weather. Colors and pattern not very attractive and do not appear to be very thick or cushiony at first. Surprised that they actually function very well. Very strong elastic gives support and no sag after several washings. Worn every day for 3 plus mile morning walk for a month. No blisters or bunching. Did not notice much moisture wicking. Would like better color selection and thicker weave. Very good value for the price would buy again.,4
147108,"I really like this band, it's fit and the clasp is easy to use. I was able to reduce the size of the links very easily with the kit that comes with the band. My only problem is how the color came off almost as soon as I started wearing it. I like this band and don't want to wear a plastic one.",4

159154,This rug is very nice! Rolled out fairly flat and looked really nice after vacuuming it. Very happy with the color and the new smell is very faint. Will likely purchase a pad to go underneath as it slides on my hardwoods and would like a bit more cushion. Otherwise very happy!,4
132226,"It works like a normal pop up toy. Yes - the music is not recognizable until the very end of the theme, but it's still cute. Some of the other reviews had mentioned that they couldn't get the Mickey to stay down after he popped up - we found that you have to hold the lid down and then turn the handle, then it will lock into place. It also has one little dent in it - but nothing severe.",4

124320,Delivered as promised; looks like it will do the job,4
136425,The couch looks nice and is reasonably comfortable. Very difficult to put together . Very poor directions screws of different sizes all packed together no measure scale. Found the same couch on line at a much cheaper price. It does come with a cover that was a good bonus.,4
144610,"This is a wonderful product for me. The color is very natural and it's super easy to apply. The toughest thing (I would think) is not knowing when you are running low. I have no idea how long it will last and you cannot view the remaining pencil. But, in all other ways, love it!",4
121392,"Worked great for 3.5 years. Then one of the heating bars, made of glass, fractured. Kind of a dramatic way to retire a toaster. Because it was one of the top bars, I almost didn’t even notice it. Pretty dangerous if you ask me. Before that, it worked great. Perfect for toasting and baking. Only downside was the dials need to be turned up all the way and then set to the desired time. Otherwise the timer might not turn off, which of course is a fire hazard. Now that I have to seek out a new one, I may or may not try this brand/model again. Still undecided.",4

147839,Nice bag thought it was black but was actually blue,4
121306,"Works great so far. Great color and texture. The only minor (minor) issue is this: the velcro strap that allows you to wrap the wire up and secure it doesn’t fit over the plugs, so instead of conveniently adhering to the wire at all times, even when not being utilized, it is unattached.",4
156752,"Its great, kinda scratches easily but buffs out and the shelves fall if you're not careful. But otherwise looks great!",4
125640,"Really wanted this to work, but it didn't work on my Pixel 3, even plugged in, my phone was still listening, which really speaks to the nature of the phone rather than this device. It does, however, work on my MS Surface Pro 3.",4
138228,It’s tricky... you have to find the perfect amount of gel too put because if not you’ll have a mess all over the place. Needs better instructions too.. also if you’re doing longer nails I recommend you put a fake tip under because the gel breaks off,4
159460,"Easy to use and well designed! I love that the remote has a clip! The only reason I cannot give it a 5 star is because the first one died out after a few uses.

156328,"It's a scale, you can pick up the same one at the local Walmart. This does not have a backlight and is hard to see in a poorly lit room (this was the case on a previous trip at night in a hotel room). Seems to be accurate so everything else was fine.",4
130218,I love it but as easy as the disk fell off I wish that it would have come with 1 or 2 replacements.,4
137891,Was skeptical at first but it works and fits my printer. Will update have to update review after a couple more prints.,4
138981,The headphones where meh.,4
128358,"I really like these guys. I have naturally short (Asian) lashes,and struggle to find falsies that don't make me feel like I have giant fans on my eyelids. Their short length works great for me. These are cheap with a solid thick black band, but if you apply on top of black liner, you're good to go. (I usually find thicker bands are a little easier to apply, at least for me.) I do recommend as cheaper falsies with great value. I will buy again.",4
139391,My students love these sensory items.,4
153999,I use it to heat up the window area of my condo where my orchids are. Seems to fend off the frosty feel from the large windows.,4
137192,Super cute socks got them for a gift for someone and she lived them,4
149251,"I hang vintage Asian textiles over doorways and windows. One new window is framed in Hardie Plank and I could not get push pins to stick in, which is what I'm able to use at the doors and windows with original wood framing. I bought this Velcro strip and it worked fairly well. The sticky side stuck to the window frame perfectly. However, although the sticky side seemed to stick to the textile, and I mounted it on the window frame, it fell down. I thought at first my cat had pulled it down but I discovered that the glue did not hold onto the fabric. I sewed it to the fabric, using light weight thread and long stitches. It has held up now for several days so I think the problem is solved. This package was more than enough for the project and I will save the remainder.",4

149702,"Lettering is shiny and looks somewhat cheap and shirt is made of a stretchy, almost swimsuit material that wrinkles easily. However, it is true to size and very comfortable, I have no real complaints!",4
156878,This thing is awesome light weight and is very easy to use all my friends want to borrow it when we go rockhounding,4
159227,As promised Good Quality-Thank you,4
149040,I had to pre-order and wait because they were sold out as soon as they became available. They are really comfortable and look nice. I wish waist band was more elastic. A few stitches were broke when I was trying to wear them.,4
158193,Nice container but I think I paid a couple of dollars more than Walmart is selling this for.,4
156084,Pretty good looking wig had to cut it to get a perfect pixi wig but not a bad buy good hair,4
135264,Cute. The Velcro is easy to unsnap which is very convenient when taking off a sleeping baby. The border seemed to curl a little after washing and drying. Kind of thin material but overall a great buy.,4
139014,Nice Rifle Holder. Very easily mounted. You do have to be easy with them. My first set broke about the fourth time I put a rifle in them. I was out of the return window by about 7 days but the Company made it right and sent me a new set once I sent them a picture of the broken piece. Very easy to deal with.,4
155997,"What a great start to a series, I can't wait to read more. It does start a little slow but it picks up fairly quickly.",4
125911,The lift supports were easy to install and worked well,4
150922,"This product came in a really nice clear plastic container/dispenser, with three rows containing nicely made dice pieces. The container was a much appreciated bonus because it provides a good way to protect and store the dies, and dispense them as needed. Highly recommended and a very good value.",4
125581,Everything was good except for the fact the instructions are in Chinese. Had to use Google Translate but overall it wasn't hard to assemble.,4
122960,so far it looks good......obviously plastic so lid was a slight challenge to install and doesn't shut tight without lock (keeping it locked for a few days to see if it helps keep it down).....may be a bit pricey for plastic..........will fit in between a table and wall perfectly in our kitchen.....great design for our needs,4
136466,The arm band broke on the child's wrist side. The adult wrist on the harness is too small. Fast Delivery,4
142667,The size of the hat is much smaller than the normal adult male,4
153407,Solid tool. Great to have for stubborn cv axels.,4
130875,Great for the price but it is a bit generic. The elastic in the top of the shorts bunches up - but I have a 4 year old son who loves basketball and he thought this was the best thing ever. :-),4
130459,"I love this cover. It is super soft and stretchy, plus it’s very cute. Unfortunately my stitching is already coming apart after 2.5 weeks of use. Perhaps I just got one with faulty stitching.",4
132129,I've used this religiously for 1 week and have not noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I will use all four pens and update my review. I'm changing my review from 2 to 4 stars. This does work but it works very slowly. I am definitely noticing after almost 2 weeks that my teeth are whiter. The trick is to dry your teeth before applying and try to keep you lips away from your teeth for as long as you can so that the product can dry on your teeth. Do this right before going to bed to get the best results and with persistence and patience you will see a result.,4
142197,I like the audio quality. Unfortunately the speakers don't all sync up on bluetooth.,4
132722,"So far so good, we will just have to see how longevity goes, only time will tell.",4
128650,they were for baby shower gift but they felt durable and well made,4
131447,Slightly difficult to use. The large needle is the easiest to use but only 1 Is in the package. I’ve been able to remove several spots. It takes a little longer for them to disappear but overall a good product.,4
131114,Great litter but the smell is horrible. Hopefully they can make it scent free in the future.,4
145681,"Grew up using these, great pricing for the set",4
150711,"Very nice toy, excellent for creative kids and adults. The only thing that I didn’t like is the instructions shows figure that uses more parts than the one came in the box.",4
145768,I bought this product and it has given me more energy & I have even lost five pounds.,4
135660,Product comes out white but once you wrap it in and turns on most clear still lose a little bit of a wait cast but that’s to be expected if you want any protection I think. The one thing that I don’t like is that it comes a little runny. When we shake up the bottle before applying some of it gets stuck in that cap lid. Because it is a little more runny a lot squirts out of the bottle at a time you have to be careful with it especially if you’re having your child try to apply it on themselves . The good thing about it being a little bit runny as it’s very easy to spread on your body and rub in.,4
130040,My son really likes it,4
135866,"The case is great! This replaces another case that destroyed itself when it protected my phone. I gave it 4 stars because the only part that isn’t protected is the ringer on/off area, which is an empty hole. The other buttons are well covered, but at first, I thought that it just fell off or was defective. However the photo does she there is a hole there. Strange to me. Otherwise this is a good, tough case.",4
141806,I like that this product includes accessories. The charger is not as well made as the original buy gets the job done. The included tool is very handy.,4
154659,"I'm a size 16 pants and I purchased the XXL in black, and the waist is a bit loose. These are like running nylons, very thin, but very comfortable. I love the side pockets, the high waist and I love the length; hits me just below the knee. I will buy again, only in a dark color because I think anything lighter will be completely see through, I will try an XL next purchase.",4
127466,on time good product,4
97356,the good...the grinder has many settings the bad...the company shortened the power cord so that it only sits next to the wall. You can't pull it out to fill it or remove the basket without unplugging it. backstory...this is my second. the previous wore a hole through the grinder area and began leaking grounds through the bottom.,3
87428,Just got it so don't really know much about it. So far so good can't complain,3
99835,"Out of the 8 , 1 didnt work.",3
100097,I ordered these to travel with and ended up when my young grandkids saw them they loved having their drinks of water from them. ( They did colapse too easily) So fascinated with how they can colapse and pull back up. We have not been able to use the largest one because there is a place on the top of the rim where it is jagged therefore not safe to use. I had not checked the whole set thoroughly and the time had passed where it was too late to return back to Amazon. Wish that there was a way to replace the large one.. Thanks.,3
109104,I wish you could raise it higher and the dimmer moves too fast. It is bright and looks better than other lights I've used the size just wasn't what I was expecting.,3
81564,"I have been looking for something I liked as much as Benefit's Gimme Brow. I think this is a nice dupe, however, the shade is too dark for me. I have dark eyebrow hair, brown hair, and pale skin. It looks too dramatically dark even though my eyebrow hairs are black.",3
90484,"Could be more tight and snug around the stomach area, but much better than others I’ve tired. Good price and quality. Overall, happy with it.",3

103937,Wasn’t expecting it to be so small,3
89631,The stones are going to be used for a Life Celebration at a University. I have to admit I expected them to be a little larger than they are. Coloring is nice this is the only disappointment.,3
80845,"This bra is the softest thing I've ever felt. I'm nearly 8 months pregnant and I didn't want to take it off. However, after probably 18 hrs of wear it's all stretched out and needs a wash. Guess it's a trade off.",3
107653,I am not very impressed with this ball. My dog is kind of small to medium and she had problems getting her mouth around it. The squeaker sounds odd and its not very soft like I thought. I think this would be perfect for a larger dog or puppy that likes to chew. Very durable.,3
94532,"Much smaller than you realize. Too bad they don't post some sort of comparison next but to another object.. Haven't tried yet but seems very short, about the height of a phone case.",3
105589,"I really love this product and it really works on my dog. It’s the only thing damp he will allow near his eyes. However, I didn’t give it 5 stars because when I opened the lid to the container, the seal that keeps it moist and contained was already peeled back. A few of them were dried out and a few missing. It was like someone bought these and returned them, but amazon just put them back on the shelf without checking it out!",3
112745,"A 4 TB drive that only shows 3.5 TB should be just that 3.5 TB. No way 500 Gigs should be unusable, that is just plain crazy. But i guess for the Sub $100 price you get what you pay for, can't really complain other than the size. It transfers plenty fast. We shall see how long it lasts.",3
117237,Way smaller than what I needed. Looks larger in the picture.,3
115075,Hard to spray into the toilet without it leaking all over my hand. Would not buy it again.,3
81714,the color and fit are perfect. The material does wrinkle when washed:-(,3
92072,"I've had the comforter for several moths now. The comforter looks very nice but unfortunately, the threading that gives the comforter the diamond texture comes apart very easily. I have had to cut off many pieces of thread so that I don't snag on them at night. On the plus side, I do like both colors and it keeps me warm at night.",3
111620,"Mask was somehow dirty (possibly from the factory) and has more of a sharp, straight form across the top. Shiny on the inside. Could be better for someone who wants to craft.",3
110154,"I'm very glad I got this for free, as I haven't lost any money. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for time. The writing was better than most that I've read lately, but not good enough to merit a higher rating. The story was incomplete, as it is just a teaser for the later books (which I will forego). None of the characters had any depth or feeling to them, and the plot was confused and incomplete. There may be some interesting ideas here, but without the other two books there is no way to tell.",3
109245,Gives a slight glimmer that only shows when you move into the light. The lip gloss is more gloss than glimmer. There isn't enough glitter per gel for the lip gloss so it just looks like you out on any old lip gloss.,3

117667,"The extra money to buy a real fishing rod is probably well spent. This one did not last long. Unless you need a collapsible one (which we wanted to have, as we were travelling) I could not recommend it.",3
86233,"Great idea and the gradual introduction works well. There are two reasons why I took off stars: 1) makes everything taste like peanuts so it’s hard to mix with solids, unless you’re only feeding things that go with peanut butter. 2) Needs to be used for a long time - they recommend 6 months. Because of the flavor i have struggled finding a way to use it daily. Works well if you’re bottle feeding milk/formula but ours is EBF for most of the time.",3
104864,"Beautiful color (burgundy), soft fabric, and cute criss-cross pattern. Good length, though I like shirts a little long. Really wanted to like and keep this shirt. However, the sleeves were so tight they were very uncomfortable, and I am fairly thin. So, sadly, am returning.",3
116951,"It’s cheap lol so I didn’t expect a lot. I haven’t taken it outside so idk about weather factors but it does the job inside. The handle did break off of it while I was carrying it though lol, I’m not too worried about it because again, it’s cheap. It still works so if you’re balling on a budget, go for it",3

82087,"I professionally got my hair done in this color and bought this to keep up the color in between sessions. While it did add color, it came it sort of uneven. Eventually it started to look purposefully ombre so it worked out but not quite the way I wanted.",3
106705,I thought my cats would love this but they only eat it if they have to.,3
115977,I read the reviews before ordering and still had high hopes. The color is nice. I didn’t like where the v-neck sits and even in the right size it doesn’t look as shapely with the belt as I expected. I tried. If it can work for you I think it would be great with pencil skirts.,3
86280,These worked for the time I needed them but I don't like the material. The material pills and runs very easily.,3
95039,I bought these to have an extra set when doing lashes. They are a bit difficult to work with and dont really have the right tension im looking for.,3
108324,"These drying towels are simple to use, the material looks like coral fleece that we sometimes use in socks. It felts soft and absorbed water fast. Comes with 4 packs of towels, I share with a box my family, and with different 4 colors, they are easy to recognize between different people, so no one would pick up wrong towels.

116728,"I had wanted some moving heads for a while now, and got these at a great price. However, these lights are very weak, and sketchy with controls. I DJ in small venues (ice House size bars, dance floors about 20 foot square), and these lights are barely visible. I was disappointed, and hope to let others know of the short comings so you won't be dissatisfied too. Trying to slave these lights is almost impossible, and the built in programs don't respond.

92330,Works fine as a pacifier but ours don't glow all night long. The only way I see it glowing like it is in the photo is if you put it near a black light for a few hours or leave it out on a sunny day. Otherwise it is very faint. We got this more for the glowing aspect but I got rid of my black lights in the 90's. Also the sun doesn't shine on our house because of the swarm of giant eagles flying around looking for Gandalf.,3

111194,I purchased this rose-gold Kate Spade case for my iPhone XR in March 2019. I expected to get at least a year out of it but the rose-gold tends to turn a dark pink wherever it wears (mostly where you hold it) It's a sturdy case and does a great job protecting my phone but disappointed that it's changing color as it wears. It was pretty when it was new though!,3

82499,"So here is an honest review: 1. They are beautiful looking headphones that are made of great quality. If you only want to 'look' at your headphones...buy these now! 2. The sound (which is most important) underperformed. I have a pair of $40 Ausdom bluetooth headphone that sounds waaaay better from mid-high and especially lows. 3. The bluetooth kept disconnecting on ALL of my devices. This never happened with my cheap ones. 4. I believe like another reviewer mentioned...they are ear heavy. This part didn't bother me too much, as they were still fairly comfortable and not too tight. However, somehow there is an imbalance with the weight of the top part (that goes over your head) because with even doing light activities while wearing them they would start to fall off. Again, my cheapies never had this problem and I've had them for over a year. 5. No bag, case or really any extras besides the charging usb cord and aux cord for when you're not using the bluetooth. This would've been perfectly fine if the main purpose was fulfilled (""the sound""). 6. All in all, I loved the name of the headphones (which did influence my purchase) and the look. Using real leather is something that is usually on more expensive headphones. But because these are headphones, not a handbag they still need to sound great too. It's like a beautiful woman with no personality or a bad attitude...not worth the headache. 7. Perhaps an updated version would greatly suit this product and I would remain optimistic in giving them a second chance.",3

102048,"They appear very big for my 5 year old daughter. My daughter has long thin fingers but is average size for a 5 year old. These would fall off easily and when worn, go all the way to the middle of her forearm, which is too big. I will wait until she's older to give it to her to wear.",3

90475,I like the brightly colored pictures. I bought it for my 7 great old son and I know he will love it. But I was a little disappointed in the quality. Its pretty flimsy paper and smallish. The price wasn't much so I should have known I guess.,3
100602,I bought these for me Hawaiian Birthday Party to make shave ice. The only problem is they tip over very easily. This makes it impossible to fill with ice without holding them. I ended up putting them in a tall glass/mug to fill.,3

My only complaint it that it is definitely not as dark as the picture suggest. Maybe if the studio was dimly lit, but under an led white light it is very clearly a dark salmon or dark peach. I only complain cause red is my favorite color, and if i knew i would have purchased the black version.",3

81636,This is absolutely the worst machining I have ever seen on a chair. What usually would be a fairly simple 20 min. assembly turned into a two hour long struggle trying to force screws into holes that are literally drilled at varying angles and degrees.

87097,"When I bought this, touch screen compatibility was one of the main decision factors. Unfortunately, that's the only thing these gloves don't do. It is a shame because they are quite well made but I was never able to use any device with a touch screen while wearing them.",3
100471,"I've been searching for studs that I can wear to bed. These had great ratings, so I gave them a try. They are good for day to day use, but left my ears very swollen after sleeping with them in.",3
81320,This took over a month to get here. The direction to assemble it are pour. The product was bent and was difficult to put together. The motor made a horrible noise when we turned it on and we had to take apart the motor case a fix the motor before it would work...don’t buy from this company. I a betting it won’t last a year.,3
107874,I ordered a large because I wear a large but this item was made smaller than the United States sizing,3
93222,A little bit more cheaply made than they look in the pictures. They are hard to flatten out/uncurl.,3

102406,"I bought this product twice. The first set was awesome. It worked well and helped reduce the swelling/puffiness under my eyes when I used the product. But, the second set that I bought made my skin irritated. I have used three pairs of the eye gels from the second set, and each time my skin becomes red, splotchy, and irritated. It feels fine when the gel is on, but once I take it off the skin becomes inflamed and uncomfortable. I really wanted to be able to use this product a lot more, but its just not worth the skin irritation. I have sensitive skin, so maybe its just a problem for people with skin like mine.",3
112601,Love the quality and the pocket for staying organized but had to use sharpie in order to see what I wrote on the tabs so unable to erase and reuse.,3

114054,Heat seems minimal but works well if add a light . The reason I’m giving it a 3 is that the vents (2 on the side; 1 on top) do not snap in correctly- I feared breaking the lid if I pushed too hard. It’s like the lid is made of like a salad container material... not too sturdy but not flimsy.,3
108201,"The product is awesome....BUT....when you receive them, they are very hard to untangle all 50 of them. It took me almost 1 hour to individually separate them. Owner of product: It might be easier to batch them in multiples of 10 instead of 50. Super difficult to untangle all of them. Also, when placing the hook on the badge, some of them were super hard to push in place. 2 so far were defective.",3

117137,The overall function works. It's easy to adjust the angle of the chair. It's also easy to get it upside-down which is easily noticed by the comfort of the chair. For long time use it's not the most comfortable thing to sit on.,3
80222,If your headlights have almost any curvature to them I would recommend not wasting your time or money on this product because it gets a bunch of crinkles in it that are virtually impossible to get out of it is however exactly as described and works exactly as described,3
106116,"My husband was diagnosed with high blood pressure so I thought this would be a good thing to have on hand. Which it worked great when I tested it on myself, it did not work too great for my husband. The cuff is too small if you have any kind of large muscles in your arms.",3
116210,"I bought this case for extra protection on the camera. Definitely protects it. It’s cute, light weight. However, it doesn’t take drops well... even on carpet. Dropped the case on accident and the front pumper dosent really attach at the top or bottom and was pushed into my glass screen protector and cause it to pop off in the corner.",3

90310,The story is a very powerful one as it is based on actual events. And it is somewhat thought provoking after the movie if one chooses to ask how this event unfold as it did. I watched the extended 4K version of the movie. It also comes with a theatrical 4K version as well as a standard Blu-ray and digital coupon. On the technical side I absolutely loved the far better than average audio effects. Great use of overheads for those with a Dolby Atmos or near equivalent system. The ground floor effects are also quite above average. The video does have some grain but the movie was not shot in 4K so not should be expected. But there were a couple things that caused me not to rate this movie as a 5. The biggest problem I have is there were times when the video and audio lost sync. To correct this I had to reload the disc. This very much interrupted the flow of the movie. Perhaps the theatrical version does not have this issue. As I am using an OPPO 203 and have not had this experience with any other video I strongly feel the issue came from the disc. I hope this is unique to just my disc and doesn't affect others. But be aware. In the end I don't regret purchasing the movie and would urge others to buy it. I hope the DVD manufacturers utilize better quality control in the future.,3
