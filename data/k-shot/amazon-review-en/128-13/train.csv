55460,"First off, this took weeks to get here. I didn't realize it was shipping from China or I would have paid a few bucks extra and gotten one that was Prime. I don't hold that against the seller it's just that I didn't realize that when I bought it. The actual product is kind of crap. I tested the first 3 keychains, #1 worked just fine and is on my car keys. #2 didn't work at all, and #3 works some of the time (I have it velcro'd to my Fire remote). I thought at first maybe the receiver just doesn't work through walls (even though the transmitter was about 10 feet away)- but the keychain transmitter was able to ping in the exact same location so it's just a faulty transmitter. It does ping sometimes - but every time it has been after I'd already found the dang thing and brought it close to the transmitter to test that it was working at all. Defeats the point! I'm really disappointed in this product and based on 2 out of 6 (again, I didn't test the other 3 so it might be a higher %) not functioning as they should I'd say give this particular product a pass. One of the tested transmitters DID work and works well, so it's not a 1 star - maybe I just got an old/bad set.",2
46956,Didn’t notice anything.,2
65690,Some of these waterers are just too large at the bottom & the water just guzzles out. I’ve had others that work much better.,2

69311,One of the corners doesn’t light up completely like the others. Not really a great product. Wouldn’t waste money on it again.,2
40478,"The case itself seems fine, but it doesn’t work well with my phone so I need to return it. There was no return label included or option for exchange. This is really frustrating and will mean that I will choose a different product.",2
49027,"Got this a while ago, it worked great for a while. Now it randomly stops playing (freezes). When it does this, the only thing we can do is open the tray, and close it, and hope that it reads the disc right. Which it didn't this last time. While playing a brand new DVD (so no marks or scratches and it plays fine in every other machine in the house). Definitely buying a different brand next time. Oh, and as a side note -- the remote operates on the same frequency as my sound bar, so when I try to turn that up or down, it performs random functions on the DVD player.",2
58060,I paid for a new book and recieved a torn book.,2
58738,I liked this product enough that I bought two so I’d never have to have my phone plugged in. However after 5 months it caught fire after sitting in my car without a phone in it for roughly a hour. As a result my brand new truck caught fire and now stuck with a $500 deductible to fix the damages,2
59327,Thin and sheds like crazy,2
69015,It was too wide to fit in my belt loops. I found way cheaper products that work better and do basically the same thing.,2
77873,I got this to wear when I ride my motorcycle due to the fact I'm still a begginer and to protect my knees if I was to fall however after one use they fell apart on me when I went to put them on for the second time I guess for the price they are terrible but I wish they were a bit more durable,2
63669,"I liked it until it wrapped everything up. The mystery was predictable, and the end of the novel was depressing.",2
55812,These aren’t like those bought from the Streak Free Website. Much cheaper and thinner.,2
52666,If you don't care too much how the print outs look it's ok but there will be ink missing in certain areas and lines won't be straight. They are squiggly lines!!! Don't use it for a resume or anything important. Straight lines are not straight.,2
78610,Looks and feels substantial until start to wash and use. It is not a easy convenient tool. I would not purchase again.,2
54784,"I can't tell you how long it took me to assemble the helmet. I had to put it down on the first try (AFTER my husband tried) because I just didn't have time. It is ridiculously hard to put the two pieces together because there are several connecting points that have to be aligned perfectly before it gets locked in. Because it's a flexible plastic, the points wouldn't stay aligned and it took considerable strength to push the parts together to lock in, once they were aligned. It was so frustrating. The helmet was one reason we chose this costume for a school presentation. And it was a hit, I will say that but it was so frustrating to assemble and I'm just glad I had the time to sit down with it. The jumper was fine but it is see-through. So be prepared to wear something underneath. My son wore skinny jeans and a T-shirt underneath.",2

69634,"One star for color: I got the winter blue and it looks more like an electric bright navy. This was not like the picture. Even the picture I took makes them look darker. They are actually really bright blue. One star for fit and material: I love the fit. I got a small and I’m 135 and 5’7 and they fit great, but the seam is coming out at the bottom. The material does keep me dry.",2
59043,"I like the simplicity of this style holder, but 2 of the 4 rings got floppy after 1 day of use. They still function as a finger grip, but will not work as a prop.",2
41895,Super cheap and didnt fit the cable worth a hoot. I would return but would probably cost more than it's worth. Would not recommend,2
48354,In my personal opinion it looks nothing like what I was looking for. Shipping was great though came in like two days of ordering,2
54557,Junk.... stay with OEM if at all possible.,2
76164,I’m giving this a 2 star because the fit is as expected. But the quality is awful! Almost like t-shirt material! Very cheap looking. These shorts should be $4 at most!,2
64299,Shows for furniture and I bought multiple but it came in and says do no use on furniture or upholstery,2
64965,I did not like this book and wont read the rest of that series that I ordered. Did not like the characters.,2
48779,Not the greatest. They tear easily and get caught on clothes. The material sucks.,2
53188,"Color dull, not at all like the picture. The material is very thin and clingy- not in a good way. Wrinkles so easily.",2
79258,I bought this because everyone was raving they are like lululemons. I did not like how these looked on me at all. They don’t hold you in like lulu or Fabletics leggings. I felt like it gave me camel toe which is a problem I’ve never had before.,2
41961,"After five days of use counter quit working and had to buy a driveway sensor off a friend because it was shipped without one, I contacted seller but they gave me the run around so it was easier to just buy one off my friend, but it works good no thanks to seller",2

59993,Broke right for the first time,2
49987,This cd is a waste of time.,2
47250,"So far it hasn’t died on me and only charge it once in a while, the big downside is the fact that the left earbud keeps cutting off way to often and the fact that the earbuds will slip out of my ear no matter what size you end up putting in the ear bud",2

62768,This novel deals with prejudice in a simplistic and heavy handed way more appropriate for children. It is a sort of allegory without any realistic development of characters. Not worth the time for an adult reader.,2

These came in a box that had the colors, but the bottle labels are in black white and gray. And states that the product has been repackaged. The repackaged eye drops are not as thick as my previous eye drops have been. They seem to be 'watered down' if you will. I have severe dry eye, and the previous eye drops helped, These bottles with the gray, white and black labels do not work as well. I am very disappointed with this order of these eye drops.",2
52673,It just didn't work for me. Voices seemed to be distorted.,2
62465,The fabric was not as sturdy as I expected it to be. I'll probably wear it as a nightgown.,2

60139,"either I was sold a dysfunctional mirror, since the mirror eats AAA a batteries! First I bought cheap batteries at a Dollar Store, the mirror requires 3 AAA batteries. Turned on the light for no more than a minute or two for the first time, came back the next morning, batteries were dead! Put 3 more new cheap batteries in, same symptoms, worked for the first 2 times then dead. Went and bought the Ever Ready Duracell batteries, the top of the line AAA batteries. Same symptoms! Very frustrated and very unhappy with the product. It seems to have a battery draw even with the light off. I use it now without the light. Thought about returning it for a refund or perhaps an exchange, but the directions and the language used on the box is French. Be careful not to leave the suction cup stand on the wall too long, because it will lose suction and fall. It happened to me when I heard a crashing noise from my bathroom at 3AM a few days after I installed it. Good luck with it...",2

42086,"On the box it says ""Hard to break!"" Maybe by a child, put they were packaged so poorly, the red and yellow crayons were already broken.

Compare my picture with the stock picture and you will see a difference.",2
52322,After a few months heard a bang in fridge and come to find out it shattered. Luckly I had it in drawer. I really loved this when it worked. Might have been the hot food under pressure and going into fridge.,2
70592,The cups are oddly large. The same size as all my other bras but these cups are much bigger. I can't wear it although I already cut and threw away the tags because I assumed it would fit.,2
65319,Cheap material but it’s doing it’s job. I just feel as though I won’t be able to have it for long before it may fall apart.,2
65363,This grill is very flimsy. Looks nice but that's about it. It arrived with missing screws. It was bent out of shape and even had a cut in the metal near the lid. The only reason I haven't returned it is because it took 3 hrs to adjust fix and assemble and i don't want to disassemble it. When cooking smoke comes out from all directions. The cover is just for show it does not close all the way. I do not recommend.,2
74421,"If you only have ten minutes for a quick smoke, this pipe is a good option. Otherwise, the small bowl is not optimal. Just about when you've settled in, it's over. Wish I had seen what this looked like before I ordered it.",2

44382,"I've installed many pulls on cabinets that don't have holes already and it can be time consuming and frustrating if you're measuring them all instead of using a template. I'm in that situation again and thought this would be a cheap way to speed things up. Our pulls are 3"" on center but total length is 5 1/2 (overhang on each end)"". The template has the pulls being installed too low on the cabinet door, almost to the point where the overhang from the lower post is to the bottom of the door. The placement isn't right, so I'll be measuring again - this thing was a waste. It would work great if there were no overhang, so it might work for some.",2

53605,I really liked this item but it runs extremely small. I ordered a large and it fit but it was a little snugger than I like it so I ordered an extra large. When I received the extra large it fit smaller than the large. I don't know if there's a production problem but I was pretty disappointed.,2
45829,Kick stand is too hard to open.,2
66416,Smelled like it should but bottle cap/sprayer fell apart into 4 different pieces and I have to put it back together everytime my wife needs to use it. Pretty irritating.,2
55628,Several of the dogs enjoy it but one of them is afraid because it is a bit noisy.,2
63171,Just received this product and the lid was cracked and the safety seal was slightly pulled away just enough to allow peanut oil to leak inside the BAG!! I can’t believe something like this was shipped in a plastic bag!,2
61904,I guess a lot of the reviews were accurate. Gave to my girlfriend as an Early Christmas gift and for a Charging case the battery life is awful!! She charges it overnight then at work will turn it on and it dies rather quickly. TOO QUICKLY for a case claiming to extend phones battery!! I see no need to buy this case except for the color and protection. But I could have bought a “Non Charging” case for that for cheaper. I DO NOT recommend this case!,2

43567,The thing is very rugged - too rugged in my opinion for something you want to throw in a suitcase - certainly can ding them for the design - if you are car camping at hotels - this would do the trick. A lightweight suitcase device - it isn't.,2
66929,I could not get past the smell to see if this product works.,2

76209,The product feels decent but smells terrible! I would not purchase again.,2
51880,"The two fasteners that secure the buckle on this belt are glued together. The back side has a flathead screwdriver slot, but the front end is just a smooth surface (ostensibly to eliminate any friction when buckling). However, since there is no way to grip the smooth front side, it’s impossible to break the glue lock and unscrew the pieces without damaging the belt. The comments tell you to grip the smooth front end with needle-nose pliers and then warns you to be careful not to damage the belt. But since that part is flush with the belt surface, the only way to grip it with needle-nose pliers is to dig into the leather to get the pliers around it. Some damage is almost assured if you do this. Poor design on an otherwise high quality belt. They could easily make the smooth front end with a flathead screwdriver slot just deep enough to get purchase to crack the glue. Then you'd just need two screwdrivers and no damage would occur. Seems like they put little thought into what the typical consumer's experience would be.",2

I'm 5'9"" and need to sit on the edge of the seat so I could work my foot pedals. The back rest sits too high above the point where it would useful providing any comfort. Having more than just two height setting would address this issue. The seat is wider side to side than it is front to back. The reduced depth gave me the sense I was sitting on 1/2 a chair rather than a full one. Finally, without the ability for the seat to swivel, you really begin asking yourself why you considered this choice in the first place. It would be hard for me to enjoy myself performing music on stage when this piece of equipment is so limiting. Be ready to buy replacement rubber feet as these slip off easy.",2

I've dropped the phone on numerous occasions and the phone has shown no signs of being damaged whatsoever. I've had all types of cases; some that I've paid more for then what they're worth. For the amount of protection that this case provides and such an affordable cost, Poetic will always get my money. Just wish there was more color options when purchasing for this model.",5

183684,"This movie is simply amazing. There is so much that can be taken away from the film that it is hard not to watch it several times over. I have only seen it in the Russian with English subtitles, but it is worth the time to watch. As someone who is frequently watching subbed work this film does an amazing job of allowing the emotion to be portrayed even in the subs and is able to make it an easy pace to follow even with slower readers. The story is one that anyone can relate too. The pains of growing older, discovering new truths about yourself and others, understanding and accepting the differences in us, standing up for you heart and what you believe in and it even manages to add in sibling understanding in to its plot. The CGI is also really good and makes the mystical creatures come alive. It also has such beautiful music that hearing it in any other language I feel would ruin the entire feeling that the movie produces. Hope you find this worth watching.",5
176622,"Love that it locks into place, has a buzzer to let you know when it’s done, but it still shuts off by itself! Made my hard boiled eggs perfectly! Also love the little handle that allows you to lift the hot eggs to get them to a cold bath...great little tool!",5

178514,"I honestly can't believe the price of this, as it's easily worth 2 or 3 times the price it's here for. I had a traditional diaper bag when my son was born, but it was a huge pain. I couldn't fit everything in it and when I did need something I had to dig around and make a huge mess. It had a ton of itty bitty pockets that I didn't need (like, pockets big enough for 1 baby sock kind of small) and it was bulky and took up a lot of space under the stroller or in a shopping cart. I hated it. Enter this bag. It's so lightweight but DURABLE. It's been tossed around, thrown in the back of the trunk, and it's still going. It's easily cleanable with a damp cloth for small messes and you can hold everything. best of all, it can be carried like a backpack (obviously) so no more digging shoulder straps!",5

188315,My cycle is definitely not regular but the app makes it so easy after I insert my information. Later it sends me a push notification telling me when to test. Anyways long story short it worked for me and my partner because now… I’m pregnant. Thanks Clearblue!,5
185336,The digital thermometer is a great product. I have a traditional thermometer which need to keep long enough to get a temperature under my baby’s arm. It can be so hard to get a temperature when she is fussy. I like this thermometer because it's very easy to use. I just need to point and click at my baby’s forehead and I get the reading immediately. I highly recommend it to all parents.,5
188706,This is a great product at a reasonable price.,5
167959,Fit my 2008 Pontiac g6. Wheel was vibrating on braking and now is smooth. Saved me hundreds of dollars installing myself.,5

9669,Purchases to try to help my cat. 16 years old with a heart and kidney problem and walking a tight rope right now. She would not eat it and I did not even realize that it was supposed to be refrigerated after you open that. Or a girl that she would not eat it. I contacted the seller asking if I could return the unopened tub since I got two tubs and I believe they made a fair offer to return the money for one tub and help me just throw out the rest of it. So I supposed to get half of the purchase price back. Figured that was fair enough. Problem is when they refunded money they only refunded a quarter of the purchase price instead of half. Not sure if this was a miscommunication. So I am still trying to work on it.,1

19476,These were SO cute and I had planned on putting them in gift bags for my classmates in nursing school for Christmas...however when I opened them they were coated with some sort of oily substance and smelled so strongly of chemicals! I soaked them in hot water and Dawn dish soap and then thoroughly cleaned each and every one of them ...as soon as they dried the smell returned...I threw them in the trash after seeing that the oily residue was even leaving marks on my kitchen table. I don't know what it was but I was very disappointed in this purchase and was completely unable to use the product at all.,1
4599,"I bought these for my rugs going on my carpets. I based my purchase on reviews and I will say, these did not work. Within a day, my carpet was sliding and I don’t even see a point on why I bought them. Don’t waste your money.",1

They are still in otherwise perfect condition and have not experienced any damage whatsoever. Do not purchase these and expect a long lifetime. Sennheiser is also incredibly difficult to work with regarding the warranty. Look elsewhere if you plan on spending this much.",1

Also, it spends little time trying to just explain how to do it in the calculator but I found those explanations not helpful at all for what it asks you to do in the practice problems. Really disappointing considering the other SAT books by this brand. Do not recommend it for anyone who does not have a good understanding of math and the test already.",1

25476,"This CPAP cleaning system uses UV light to disinfect which is fine. The problem is that you have to completely disassemble your hose, mask and water reservoir for it to work. The SoClean system is much better as the entire hose, mask and reservoir is disinfected at one time WITHOUT taking the CPAP unit apart and sterilizing it piece by piece..unless you have nothing better to do with your time. I sent this UV unit back and it cost me $10 in shipping so I'm trying to save you the time and money ordering this.

I went to pull the tab to remove the protective film before applying it to my device and there was NO plastic film. I checked the second one in the package and found the very same thing. Just a peel tab stuck directly to the tempered glass it self. Very Unhappy with the product quality!,1

27435,This product did not help my poodle at all. It fit just like the picture showed but it rubs the penis of the dog because of where the velcro attaches to the unit. I even wrapped the sewn edge to pad where it hits. My dog was pretty much bed ridden so it wasn't due to him moving around. It caused us another problem. Save your money and just wait 1 or 2 months for your dog to heal.,1

11132,"This is the cheapest made thing I've ever bought for my kitchen. The pump buttons don't work. I at for almost 15 minutes just pumping the button over and over, and the oil didn't move more than a 1/4 inch after all that. The buttons kept popping out and separating from the housing every 10 pumps or so. Taking it apart and putting it back together helped for all of about 5 pumps, and then it stopped working again. If it had better construction I'm sure it would be great, but in this form it is essentially useless. I finally looked it up online and found this is a huge issue with it, but for some reason those reviews haven't propagated to the Amazon page for the product yet.",1
6281,Please don't buy. The hook up to the power block is just horible. One set of lights only does red,1

36026,I am truly shocked that All-Clad has put their name on this product as their pots and pans are of excellent quality. The lids do not properly match the ceramic inserts which allows for heat to escape during the cooking process. The result is that food may not be cooked as expected.

153555,"Not very consistent in elastic stretch/size, but very cute!",4
121493,2 reasons for 4 star first is it's too white. That might sound silly but it's even whiter than the face plate it comes with it so white it's extremely noticeable. Second it's really loud it ticks like an old dang clock.,4
129694,Good looking product.,4
155657,Don’t expect to fit a lot in here . It’s a little smaller than expected it will do for short hikes.,4
130384,The purse could have been a little larger. But basically like it.,4
137590,"Thought it would have more of an orange flavor, thus 4 stars. Tastes more grapefruit like. Was impressed with how I felt the day after a heavy workout. I was not as sore and tired like I normally would be. BCAA was the only new item I added so it had to be that.",4
155178,"SHORT AND CLEAN ROMANCE. IT WAS A LITTLE TOO BRIEF, AND TOTALLY IMPLAUSIBLE, BUT I STILL LIKED IT. I WOULD READ MORE BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR.",4

131530,The table itself is exactly what you would hope for but one small problem the black paint on the sides seems to peel off quite easily not very noticeable but the only thing preventing this table from being a 5 star!,4
143929,Really cute design on this keychain alarm. Purchased for my daughter's 75 year old great grandma. She is still active and independent and because I purchased a different set for my daughter I thought of her safety as well. I didn't personally try the alarm as this was a gift but my daughter and her nana did and said it was loud.,4
138328,"Cute and soft. Purchased at $20, a bit overpriced.",4
136007,"When I bought this set I was aware that they were going to be heavier than a nylon utensil but I wanted the extra protection it gives to my pots. It is heavier for sure, but easy to get used to. Great quality.",4
147242,"She did not come looking as nice as the photos show, which was why I gave it 4 starts because I had to purchase makeup to make her look decent. Not sure why her head is so yellow and she has skimpy brows but I was able to fix it with makeup. I pierced her ears and changed her lips and also gave her some brows. You could also use her without the head but I needed it so I put the work in. She is sturdy for the most part. She is a good buy especially if you are good with makeup.",4
133417,"so far I'm not unhappy, I have found some devices it will not work with.",4
139979,"These socks are great fabric and look well made, but they are HUGE! They come up to my daughter's thighs. We fold them down, so it's not a huge deal. I was just surprised at how long they are.",4
122771,"I like the customization of all the buttons. Drawing pressure makes a difference, nice fluidity. Froze a couple of times when I drew close to the edge of the drawing area, had to unplug and plug back in.",4
126122,"I use this projector as a home video projector. I use it in place of a tv. While it does come with speakers, they were very tin sounding and gave me a headache. Instead, I ordered separate $20 computer monitor speakers and the combination work great. This projector did have a wear frame skipping thing going on with one of my laptops though because the FPS match was 1 off. My projector runs at 59 FPS which I cannot change anywhere. I have to use a separate laptop and change my laptop’s core settings to be flexible with this and to force it to stream up to 59 FPS. Other than that, the picture is good, focuses well, the planing is good, nothing else to note!",4
158089,Perfect fit summer nights where u just went to leave the window open and no mosquitoes biting at you,4
137359,"It’s a very heavy duty product. I was looking for an extension cord which is flexible as I have lot of power cords which take lot of space when powered in. This is a very smart device as each single station can be rotated and it can accommodate large power cords too easily. Another cool feature is USB adaptor which can be used to charge phone directly. There are two limitations with the product though 1) as I understand from using it, it does not has over charge protection 2) the max current combined of the USB port is 2.1 A which is kind of less if both the USB stations are in use",4
120219,Absolutely love the crackers the flavor if you’re doing low-carb I give them a thumbs up. The downside is they are very costly for a cracker and I wish I could buy them somewhere and not have them shipped because they arrive mostly broken up. I had a hard time finding one whole cracker in the bay,4
136912,Not that easy to program but it's sturdy,4
158848,These pens skip a lot when I'm writing on something right on top of a desk. No problems with notebook-bound paper though.,4
158151,"great item at a great price, works well with no leaks so far",4
139445,"Great deal, but the smell is quite strong.",4
133103,Definitely runs small. Had to return the first pair but the size bigger fits fine,4
155404,this was delivered quickly and was easy to set up. did a great job reducing the humidity in our basement,4
142642,"Wife loved it, but it had some grammatical errors.",4
154649,Excellent for detangling. Keeps natural hair from matting up.,4
124551,This Item Came A Little Different From The Picture But Was Still Very Cute. The Colors Were The Same. I Love It!!!,4
156042,"Very strong product. Generally does a good job, but I would only use it for spot treatment. Every time I lathered it on a big area it leaves my skin very red.",4
126523,Fits a little longer than others I have purchased but so cute.,4
139156,It is nice color but my lips feel sensitive when I put this on.,4
136566,A Tony bit smaller than I expected but it does the job. Great price,4
156160,It is a very well written paranormal romance that draws you in from the beginning. The relationship takes place on the psychic and physical plane and you get an intimate look at both Rage and Pandora and really understand their motivations and their feelings. Maybe it is a little rushed but that's my opinion mostly because I prefer slow burn romances... Like previous books I really liked this one to.,4
124133,I read the reviews before ordering and i got them and i really like them. Not as true to color as the picture but close enough.,4
122539,"At first I was really excited about this find. It looks sleek and nice. It fits under cabinet fine. But when lifting the head, it hits the wall, so it has to be pulled out some, wouldn’t be a big deal, but the awesome thing that keeps it from bouncing around(suction cups on the bottom), makes it a bit of an ordeal. But easily ignored. The one thing I am very disappointed about, everytime I use it, is how far the mixing tools(paddle and whisk) are from the actual bowl. Easily 1/4 of an inch away. It makes the mixture leave a layer of mix against the bowl, never to be touched by the mixing tools. So it HAS to be turned off and sides scraped, multiple times during use. Way past the time to send back, and is better than having nothing. However, I would look for one that has the mixing tool much closer to the edges of the bowl, so you really can leaving it mixing to itself.",4
150888,"Looks a little cheesy, a little smaller than I thought it’d be",4
153535,Letters are too small to read from my chair to me TV stand.,4
122050,"The pillow case, zippable, is wonderful. The first night I used I put my pillowcase on it. It was stuffed and I knew it would too high. However, I used it. My neck ache was worse. I removed three handfuls of the foam the next night. It was better. Removed four more large handfuls that night. Much better next morning. Future buyer: you may have to adjust the amount of filling to suit your needs.",4
159778,"This attachment is awesome. The adapter raises the possibility of the Headphones. Audio sounds great coming from the adapter, but the volume is not as loud as it is wired. One big con is their is some type of sound that the adapter makes. It sounds like there is a bit of frequency. Another con of the adapter is the price. The way the buttons click and the adapter feel is not what you would expect from something that cost $50. If this product was between $30-40 it would be fair. Another con is the batter life is on the short range. It is not terrible but if it could last 2hrs longer it would be perfect.",4
134755,The dress is exactly as pictured and really very pretty. It fits my daughter but may be a tad big around the chest. Not too big that she can't wear it. She's tall and lean so overall it probably is true to size. Definitely recommend it.,4
143996,"The card was very nice, I wouldn't normally order a card online but it was way easier than going through a million cards at a store.",4
157791,Sofa is great!! Just want cushions to remove,4
157808,They work and I like the white light they emit,4
159794,"My wife loves this stuff. Personally, I think it smells as though Cheech and Chong just stopped by for a visit whenever she uses it.",4
122365,"Arrived well packed and undamaged. We have only been out one weekend depending on this battery to power our travel trailer but it powered everything we needed, including a small 12v fan at night, with very little power loss, it performed beyond our expectations!",4
148204,I enjoyed reading this story. A very good storyline and great characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys cozy mysteries.,4
152058,"This holster is perfectly molded to the Taurus Judge Polymer Public Defender. After a little work adjusting the retention screws for best hold, it is a nice, protective, very useful holster.",4
134886,Fit my wife's swollen leg.,4
127278,It doesn't fit completely over the screen. It will serve the purpose of keeping the screen clean. Easy wipe off.,4
148507,Fun game for the family.,4
139702,Good until it got a hole in it. Now I need to find where it's at.,4
128766,I got this since I was getting tired on paying for the blood stripes. It's a lot more convenient and seems to be pretty accurate compared to blood and urine stripes.,4
131672,"Nice tables,only took about 10 minutes to put together. Sturdy. We bought for use as bedside end tables for a guest bedroom",4
132007,"Bought this set as a great deal for special event decoration. Length of one was sufficient to string along three, 8 foot table lengths (end-to-end). Appreciate that these are battery operated and have a choice of programs. Hubby was even impressed that the battery casings looks to be safe enough for outdoor use. Perfect for lowlight indoor table settings, lit backgrounds, garden lighting (YMMV) and kids' room decor.",4
121519,I wish they were wider. I put two on the same side and have to set them at different levels to fill the gap.,4
122778,Received . Very nice . Recommend it highly,4
135223,Very good. Well worth it,4
144103,Really like the iPad case,4
154188,"Very nice! Item came one short of 10. But, well packaged to prevent scratches during shipping.",4
130443,"My son enjoyed his socks, he had crazy sock day at school. The only thing I didn't like was that one pair looks more for like a girl.",4
130205,Great pressure from this little thing. Easy to set up.,4
142803,It was a gift. Seemed ok,4
122610,The instructions were solid until the top of the closet. Then they were lacking a way that made understanding the process ridiculously challenging.,4
121474,"Exactly as expected, maybe better.",4
150267,Definitely worth the price. Instructions are very vague but any do it yourselfer can figure it out. Had to use a thread chaser on one of the bolt holes but no big deal.,4
139800,"My Aunt loved the bracelet as always with Alex and Ani, I would've gave it 5 stars but this item does not come in the box! I had to grab an old one of mine, it comes in a baggie",4
135077,I have this hung in my guest bedroom. It is a nice addition to the space. Easy to hang.,4
141936,"This is a very detailed, thorough, and truly global treatise on the Great War. Keegan has painstakingly researched and cross-reference this work. As you read you are at one moment seeing the politics and war plans as from a great height, and the next you are hearing the words of men muddied and bloody in the trenches. While one can certainly sense this is written from the eyes and mind of an Englishman, Keegan does justice to the experiences of French, German, Russian, and the large myriad of other nationalities who participated in this disastrous conflict. Well done.",4
148479,"Very firm, but does help with arch support.",4
146252,"Just installed this. I'll concur with others; the knockouts at the bottom are more like faint scoring. Better to use a hole saw or Dremel to get the job done. Another weakness to the product for me were the terminal connections inside the box. The terminals were really too small and cheap feeling, in my opinion, especially if you're going to attach a pool motor or 20 A load. If you properly wire those, you'll find the necessary wire gauge is a tight fit.",4
125691,"I like how Kelly used a lot of Scripture in order to help us transform our mind which is exactly what God tells us to do. I especially liked thinking about how I am not God's co-worker even though that sounds good on the surface. Instead, I am God's daughter. I really meditated on that part and it was so freeing since I'm in a busy time right now where I have been living like I needed to do everything in ministry perfectly for God to love me. The one thing I wish was different is that I wish this was printed like a workbook. That is how Kelly intended this book to be used, but it wasn't published that way. I thought it was going to be more reading than it was. Instead it was kind of like reading a lot of blog posts and homework assignments all at once. So if you are looking for a Bible study on the topic, this is a good one.",4
133838,Too big for our pool,4
142024,"I had gel polish on my toes and fingers. It took 2 thick coats or it to come off my toes, which I thought was great!! I used it on my acrylic nails and it melted them.",4
138275,"Fragile. But, easy to clean.",4
132600,"A fabulous, fun read with a touch of romance.",4
151291,I found the recipes and each recipe is well-instructed as readers can follow easily. I love this cookbook.,4
122090,"Good pair of sticks, it's like a longer 2B",4
150251,I love this. My favorite part is that the pad has perforated edges between the grocery list and the menu so that the menu can stay on the fridge and the list can go to the market.,4
126141,Works as intended - in my case - using it strictly as a archive device - thus it's not plugged in all the time - I plug it up - do my archiving & then disco it ... no issues ...,4
131087,"This thing was AWESOME.... until it stopped working a few days later. I used it a lot, but then one of the pads stopped functioning. Had to return it, but customer service was awesome and sent me a brand new one. So far, no problems and great with pain management! Highly recommend!",4
158234,Needs to be updated since the author has changed a few things on his blog.,4
155330,"The rectangular upright bin is huge! I thought it would be used to store files vertically so it wouldn't be that wide, but it's actually wide enough to store them horizontally. I guess that might be good for some, but I would have preferred if it was not that big. The post it bin is also a little large, but it's fine. The set altogether is very nice.",4
149425,Story was amazing. Ending could have gotten there much sooner.,4
139453,My first impression I have is they are very stiff. The synthetic soles seems to be very aggressive for basically an everyday walking shoe. They have ridges that look like they will fail after a short period walking on hard surfaces. When I put them on they fit very well. They are stiff but will hopefully loosen up after wearing for awhile. I wish the sole was rubber. My biggest concern will be the durability of the sole. I think they will be nice shoes. Time will tell.,4
145960,Liked the package but would have liked napkins to be lol also they were pink,4
141895,Organic and reasonable. Roasting is well done. Bean quality is very good.,4
151734,I do like the soft silk material and it keeps light out sufficiently. I don’t like that this mask goes all the way to my hairline which makes forehead sweat and break out. I also don’t care for the adjustable part of the band as I can feel the plastic against the back of my head at times. I had the previous version of this mask and it was narrower on my face which I liked but the elastic band stretched out after a year. I’ll wear it but also keep looking for one a little smaller.,4
158491,"The oil is lighter than others and easy to work in, which is a big plus. Decent brush and comb set. The brush hairs don't just fall out after a single use. Overall, a good product for the price.",4
152295,Worked as expected. Every now and then a black blip on screen prevented from giving 5 stars,4
156871,"This thing is rugged and works well. I do wish that it came with bolts and wingnuts for mounting but I get that they can't know the thickness of what you're mounting it too, but a good guess would have been real nice.",4
130613,"Havent had this very long, but loving it so far. Seems to be well made and cuts right now. Really easy to use and fits in the hand user friendly. I recommend. 4 stars cause nothing is perfect.....",4
145838,"Mine were almost a year beyond the Best Buy Date. Still tasted ok by me. I will buy again. I don't really like the warnings on packaging, except when it was made.",4
153441,4 star playing tray. Works well for its functions. Fairly easy to set up and your child can use it as they please. They can use it to draw or they can use it as a table to put food on or other toys to play with. Only negative is it doesn't have an adjustable height for larger kids.,4
122751,"Great product, wires and adapter are sturdy. Wires are together which avoids tangling. Only wish they were longer (to use on other batteries / machinery).",4

122255,"Extremely well paced! Not a lot of ups and downs but continuous forward momentum. Great characters and sultry bad girls, loved it",4
124368,convenient for the minis...but quite a bit flimsy...but then again...it is silicone,4
142381,My massage clients like the extra padding this provides on the head rest. I wish it was slightly bigger so it would fit the head rest better.,4
129848,"This fit very well, on my Brinkmann fairly well, though it is a little tight. Even though it is a 72 inch cover and my grill is a 72 inch grill, the cover could use a little slack on the ends so I don't have to worry about the sharp edges ripping my grill cover. The material feels very strong, but several repeats of putting it on and off I expect there to be some fabric wear in the corners of the grill cover because of how snug it was over my grill. There are little loops and clips for attaching it underneath the grill so if you are planning on long term storage it is really great!",4
136123,Nice but bigger than what I was looking for.,4
139005,I use this daily and have noticed a difference!,4
157720,"Air-tight, simple design. A bit awkward to get the butter out when cooking, or at the table, because it is double the depth of a European stick of butter. Overall, I like it. I'd buy it again.",4

136304,Giving 4 stars just because they’re pretty thin,4
149887,Cute ice cream set for my daughter. The pieces are made very well. There is a magnet on the cone to he the scoops of ice cream on. I would have given it 5 starts if they made the container large enough to store all of the pieces!,4

141298,"made from good quality , lots of space inside for put in more stuff",4
135458,"I like the product. Takes a but of time to fine tune but I like all of the options for alerts and protection. My main issue is with the app and Bluetooth. It's Bluetooth range isn't great (must be in same room)... Also, the app lacks watts in or out and only shows Amps. Lacks any kind of performance charts or graphs. Just shows last DoD, Average DoD, Deepest DoD, Total Watts Discharged vs Charged (weird that they convert that to watts but not live Amps to Watts...), Lowest vs Highest Battery Voltage, and a few other things. Some charting would help with battery health tracking. All in all, it's a decent BMS, my favorite feature is the estimated time you can run whatever load till whatever custom DoD% you choose is reached.",4
155795,I was tired of replacing $100+ tennis every year for non-athletic purposes. I simply do a lot of walking. This were an excellent price and are great for every day use.,4

110316,Had mystery and romance a plenty! Nicole Jordan books are always filled with adventure. This book was a reading pleasure.,3
97860,Not too good quality,3
109746,"Nice spacious bag. Can fit multiple items, especially if you have multiple children. The only problem I have is the chemical smell of the bag. This makes me question what could be in the materials to emit such a strong, chemical odor.",3
107813,Was good enough originally - but plastic parts didn’t hold and now it slides down after a couple of days when I tighten it and falls over. Maybe find a way to keep the screws and the plastic knob from slipping?,3
91757,Quality is good but pretty bulky,3
117219,I got what I paid for. Okay quality. Good for apartment or 1 person.,3

82238,"Bought to try. Works surprisingly well. Wish it was larger, considering the price.",3
101885,"The collar works, but the prongs must be situated right under the dog's mouth. If it strays even a half inch in either direction, the collar doesn't detect any barking - even on the highest sensitivity level. I have the collar really tight and it still swivels. I'm afraid to make it any tighter. The prongs are already digging into him.",3
97292,It wasn’t as good as I thought it would be. The side doesn’t hold it in real well,3
83966,"Does not last as long as I expected, particularly in the heat! Works well for a couple hours though.",3
90234,it was a little tart..,3
112986,Over priced for what it is.,3
83687,This case was good for the first two weeks until the whole rim around the case came off. I recommend this case if you have a back up case also the case gets lots of scratches.,3
80358,Appearance. Not packaged well honey all over the outside of the package. Product fell out of the cardboard when I picked it up. Seems awfully thin for honey.,3
102300,"It looks nice. But it took so long for shipping, and its corner is broken.",3
102523,This is my second order but this time I got a lot of liquid instead mineral from the container when use. Did anyone have the same experience? Is it a bad batch?,3
86662,"I was bummed he two tracks didn’t fit together. Be aware that here are he light up tracks as well as other normal tracks, but the two do not work together. I prefer the normal tracks over the light up. They’re more pliable and easier to put together.",3

113634,"Meh. It works, you get what you pay for.",3
113361,"The lock itself is perfect for my needs, but the mounting bracket is a true disappointment. I had to tighten the mounting screw on every ride, and it is absolutely annoying. In this price range this problem should to eliminated. Now i have to use an extra velcro strap to fix the wobble and keep the lock in the desired position.",3
107010,Not the picture shown. The pic was supposed to be vertically oriented ... and a different photo. What I rec’d is an OK pic but I needed a vertically oriented pic for the place I wanted to hang it. Disappointed.,3
92534,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE PRODUCT - NOT THE SELLER. SELLER IS GREAT! This MIGHT be a good product, I purchased it because I thought curcumin would be a good thing to take. However, when I opened the bottle it was SMURF blue! The manufacturer felt the need to add FD&C Blue #1 to the product. First - WHY; and second, if you're adding a DYE, why BLUE? Isn't curcumin orange/yellow? I strongly feel that if it is not necessary to the quality or performance of the product - keep it as pure as possible. I've got to think (and I'll research this) that the DYE is not dangerous, but I question the necessity to add it at all... Not sure if I'm keeping it or not - was just VERY surprised when I opened the bottle!",3
109393,"I'll keep the hat, but it's not what I expected or really wanted. The body of the hat is, indeed, unstructured but the brim is not in the least soft. Instead, it is a stiff material which is sewn in three separate pieces so that the bill can be folded.",3

89520,"If you have to use the extensions, they are worthless. They are so flimsy my puppy had figured he can push hard enough and break through. If you don’t need those it’s perfect .",3
111425,"The construction seems decent, laser works, good ease of use, however I'm not sure how accurate this is. You can turn the bullet a tad and the laser will point slightly differently. It is not perfectly aligned with your barrel, so at 25 yards can be pretty off.",3
109514,"I realize that when you make a forecast you may be wrong,however I watch weather news to see what they think will happen. So far this channel seems very timid in the forecast department. Geez take a chance.",3
107965,This was my 2nd set. Loved the first one so ordered the 2nd one and the first time I put it on the elastic broke on the fitted sheet which sort of bummed me out so be careful.,3
86307,Not very comfortable but does help with pain and stress on shoulder.,3
80472,"Loud. I bought this hoping it would be quieter than my original, but no. I guess noise is just inherent in this type of cooler.",3
119376,Work OK but tend to loosen,3
116281,It didn't stay on...It kept coming off,3
90305,"The suit itself is cute and the color is great. BUT the built in cups are probably big enough for nothing more than a C-cup, unless the underwire is through the middle of the breasts. Very disappointed.",3
93048,This is a nice watch but does have some of the flaws mentioned in other reviews. It's also a bit bulky.,3
105756,Heard repair never work that well,3
106176,Cable to short for crew cab long bed pickups. It's about 4 feet to short to work on our 05 Ford F-350 crew cab long bed. Now i'm trying to band aid a solution. Can't replace as it has the trigger wire for the cam at the dash end and a tap for reverse light at the back end. Shenanigans.,3
100698,"Good product for a quick touchup, not for everyday use.",3
80447,"Product fits my daughter's new tablet perfectly and I love the design. I was a little bummed the case came damaged when there was no damage to the outer packaging. My kiddo is 8 so there's no sending it back and waiting for the replacement. Still, I'm happy with the purchase overall",3
86713,She really liked it.,3
109051,Thicker than expected and the fabric is runny but overall it’s pretty good.,3
81257,A little big for newborns. But good for one year old baby’s or more. Fabric is very soft.,3
81949,Does PQQ help with MEMORY PROBLEMS? I purchased it because I read an article that says it does help memory issues. Not one review on here has mentioned any of the sort. Please advise. Thanks,3
118619,Dress fit ok but was see through and not finished well.,3
115504,Pages were all blank. I expected a general outline for needed information,3
113705,Plastic; sweats on surfaces when filled with drinks and ice.,3
110297,"Very cute, my kids are really enjoying learning to sew with these. This particular brand, however, looses the color on the plastic. This is a problem because you need the color to know where to put your stitches. It rubs off over time making it slightly more difficult to figure out where to put what color. But there are other things I like better than other kits. Like the actual metal needle. Others only come with plastic needles. And the holes on this kit are smaller which, in my opinion, makes the finished product look better.",3
87882,"They are a nice weight and the color is pretty, but the d12 is a bit uneven and the d8 shipped with a small chip. I do wish that they did have the turquoise marbling as shown on the photo.",3
102434,"It's exactly what I excepted it to be. However, I just want to state a suggestion/improvement to the product. It would be nice if you have a quantity of 4 sets of legs. That way you could use an extra set to raise your stand a little higher. So I will have 2 spare plastic platforms and 2 outfitted with all the legs. I needed to raise my monitor just a tad more than what was provided. So, I ordered another one just so I can raise my other stand.",3
94299,Perfect for what we paid and where we are using the product. Will move it into the garage in a year or two and upgrade to something better for where it is at now.,3
91202,They worked well. I liked the fit and look but after 3 months of moderate use they no longer turn on.,3
80731,"I was really disappointed by this stuff. Some reviews said it was great for fine hair, but unfortunately, it made my very fine hair greasy and weighed it down. I’ve used a very small amount and tried it for a few weeks, but it just isn’t working for me. It would probably be ok for semi-fine hair, but my search for a shine and anti-frizz product that works on truly super fine hair continues!",3
101594,This book is designed for a caregiver in a group home setting. Not for someone that is taking care of an elderly parent with dementia. The author has some good points but overall the book did not provide anything I didn’t already know.,3
101442,This was a great idea but fell short of what I wanted and needed. Half and half is available in most places I travel and it tastes so much better. For countries that don’t have half and half this will have to do.,3
116271,"good screen resolution, lightweight. however it sometimes overheats when charging and takes long to charge. the voice unlock is intermittent and face unlock DOES NOT WORK",3
104623,The diffuser bracelet didn't fit. The leather piece could be longer to accommodate a larger bony wrist. The chakra beads are great! A little tight for me but still workable since it's elastic. I would buy again for friends with smaller wrists.,3
107018,My husband spent a little more money on this net than some other choices. But we were disappointed by the quality. It didn’t seem more heavy-weighted netting and the knots nearest to the rim came undone (the net was not installed and I think one of my kids grabbed it but the knots slip out easily) and so we had to re-tied knots). Clearly that is not easily done. We couldn’t figure out the type of knot they used in the first place.,3
97591,"These fit fine/somewhat small, but are made of very thin fabric. They are really more like think tights. Fine only if you plan to wear with a long tunic.",3
106834,"These are for use IN DARK AREAS! I admit, I didn't pay enough attention to the description. The automatic mode works great in low light and dark areas but if there's any significant amount of light in the room they simply won't turn on automatically, and the switch is a bit too difficult to justify constantly turning these on and off. I tried to set these up in the corner of a room that could use a little more light, but these lights would never turn on because there were still ceiling lights in the room and it wasn't quite dark enough to trigger it. I found a good use for them next to the front door so when we enter the house at night it turns on and we don't trip over any pets that might come running to the door. That being said, if you have pets the battery life of these will probably not be as great as you might expect because they will trigger only at night... your mileage may vary.",3
97371,Didn’t like it. Made my hair feel greasy and heavy no matter how much I used. Didn’t give me any type of beach look,3
87038,"Difficult to turn on and off; button is tiny and not easy to reach. Since each control button has more than one function depending on degree of pressure, I have a difficult time navigating with old fingers. I frequently lock it and am unable to unlock. The screen is easy to read",3
87514,I havent used it for it's intention. I tested it and I'm having issues for lack of knowledge. Night vision isn't very clear and the sound is great considering it's size. I'm worried about it now because a friend brought to my attention hacking might give criminals entry into my privacy. Yikes!,3
89560,"It fits a bit big, very comfortable material though!",3
116737,I disliked that the rod was placed way too close to the front so hangers stick out which is a total disaster for the eyes now I have to live with this since I can’t afford another shelf smh,3
114385,To large for my taste also a bit dense,3
112136,"Are these reviews real? Easy to cook in? What are you talking about...this is a faucet, and a lousy one at that. Easy to install, but the photos are incredibly misleading. You need at least 2-3 inches of clearance behind the facuet to put the handle all the way back. Had to install it offset to compensate. Operation is cumbersome, although maybe it's common with these types of designs that make them a pain to rotate freely and reset back into the holder. The 360 degree rotation could be true but good luck not pulling a muscle trying to move it. Could loosen up in time but not going to struggle with it find out. Finish is nice and appears well built, but the functionality is questionable.",3
111593,"I am very unhappy with this Speck case. It is not at all like the other Speck cases I have. Very plastic, bendable feel. I like the ""Speck Products CandyShell Grip Cell Phone Case"" the best and I didn't realize this one was different.",3

118399,Fit as expected...i was not happy with the fact thaI it took on the dye from some of my clothes and then would not clean off. I ultimately bought another band and no longer use this one.,3
103441,The outside is attractive and has a beautiful design. The tissues are very cheap and thin.,3
101270,"It jams way too frequently. When it works, the labels look great!",3
86966,Sturdy and very very sharp. Quite heavy for its size.,3
100832,"LED lights are super bright. Not a gentle glow. The bunny is soft and cuddley like a regular stuffed animal. Unfortunately, the glow eats batteries and stop working all together less than a year after purchase.",3
101192,These are quite small and hard to remove the frosting to change them around.,3
110355,Smaller than I thought,3
115851,Bought this chest-strap heart rate transmitter mainly to connect with cardio machines at Planet Fitness but it doesn’t connect with anything. It only seems to work with certain other Garmin products and perhaps a Concept II rowing machine.,3
90541,"I just received this product it was a quick delivery and very anxious to use it. as soon as opened the package I could see that the bottle was cracked 😭 and when I opened it, is wasn't even halfway full hmmm ☹️ very dissapointed 😩 for the price and the size of the container makes you think is at least more than half way full. Other than that the Product seems to be a good quality for coloring your sweets 🙂.",3
106236,I bough this game to play with my brother. But it takes way to long for one to get through the story enough to play online.,3
96903,"The table is beautiful and very sturdy. Only problem is that the canvas drawers take up knee space, so my (very small) four year old doesn't fit comfortably. We will end up taking the drawers off and coming up with a different solution for Lego storage. Definitely a bummer, but it's a nice table otherwise. Oh and the reversible top is very heavy to flip. I don't mind that, though.",3
96982,I wish I had gotten classic instead of applewood smoked. It is a little too sweet and the flavor profile is vastly less versatile. I got it to add to pulled bbq jackfruit and really can’t imagine using it for anything else besides bbq dishes. The sweetness of it also tastes a little synthetic so all around not too pleased.,3
84577,Not really a good phone when it come to the RAM and also the software is not latest Windows 10. I'm not sure it can be upgraded to W10.,3
109608,"Yeah, the purple controller I got seems to have directional problems. The black one seems to be okay for Smash Bros, but the purple control definitely not sufficient.",3
106567,"The band is very attractive and comfortable with my Charge 2. You must factor into the cost that it will last less than 3 months before the finish wears and becomes worn, black and unattractive.",3
92793,"Well written book, though content didn't get me as excited as I thought. A huge chunk of the book was on race and gender. I thought it overpowered the book, but I understand this is her reality. For reference, I am a black woman also, so I can relate. Overall, didn't agree with her approach to sex, relationships, and finances in relationships. If anything, the book makes me appreciate how different individuals are, how different our childhood and backgrounds are, and how that shapes us. Still love me some Gabrielle Union :)",3
102971,"I wasn't very impressed with the recipes in here. Not a lot that I would eat (or my kids would eat, which is important to me). Kind of disappointed :(",3
113895,Head phones worked ok but hurt my ears. When it came time to return the product they what to charge you to drop it off at a USPS location or drive 14 miles to drop it off at an Amazon drop off location. Not cool,3
116718,The receipt was missing in the package. The product was good. Can anyone tell me if that’s normal. Thanks!,3
88584,"Really love the design of these sheets! I've had them for about two months now and some seams are already coming undone, which is a bummer. Wish they were a tad bit softer, but overall I'm still happy with purchase. The print is definitely my favorite part about them.",3

89469,"pros: Cat loves it, easy to set up. There isnt much noise.\ cons: Broke fast, the cat was playing with it and the stick part snapped. Wasnt able to glue back together with gorilla glue, hot glue might work(i dont have). i ended up just removed the string and the elastic parts and wrapping it around my door knob, going to find a way to put it on a wall or door again. Its pretty high up, my nearly full grown cat has to jump to get it which is good and bad. Better exercise, but will hurt her joints in the long run. Dont get this if you have a small kitten or a super lazy fat cat. I doubt they will jump to play with it, but you CAN modify it and extend the string if you wish to do so.",3

118806,"Love the design of the bees on this case, but with the yellow color, the edges of the case very quickly got grubby looking from use. Also, when I pull it out of my pocket, nearly always one of the corners comes loose and I have to pop it back around the phone.",3
113610,"I purchased navy blue color. It’s a true navy blue, BUT the finished edge is a royal blue and doesn’t match. For the price, what can one expect? These window treatments are temporary for us, so it’s not worth it to return.",3

90844,"I've tried many oil brands and Plant Therapy is hit or miss. Many of the scents require more drops than usual and scents don't last longer than about 60 minutes.

Makes a good set to use by mixing with other, higher quality oils thus creating your own custom scents.",3

115783,"I bought this ac about a month ago and it has been working great until today, the hottest day of the year. I have the ac turned on ac mode and the fan turned up. The hose is installed right, not bent or obstructed. I set the temp down to 70. I cleaned the filters and emptied the water. But ac still only comes on for at most 2 min then there is a thump noise and it turns off leaving only the fan going. Then after about 5 min the ac comes on then turns off again. It's been doing this for the last hour and I don't know what to do. I'm miserable and hot and drenched in sweat. It's 98 degrees out at the moment. I've tried everything I can think of. I thought maybe it has overheated so I turned it off for half an hour but made no difference. I can't afford a new ac already but it's looking like I'm going to have to buy one. I'm updating my review the day after I posted it. As soon as the outdoor temperature started going down the unit was able to stay on for longer periods of time. As soon as it was back in the 80s instead of hovering around 100 I stopped having problems and the unit has worked fine since. I assume it was just to much for it to cool the space it previously had no trouble with once it became dangerously hot out. I don't expect many more days that hot but am going ahead and getting a second unit of some type just in case. I changed my rating from 1 to 3 stars.",3
97629,"I gave this 3 stars because it had everything I needed in a starter kit and the price was fair for that purpose but I was very disappointed. The mat, which I assume would be the most important part of a Yoga package, is extremely light, flimsy, and rolls up at edges no matter which side it is turned on. Also has bad grip and slides around with the slightest movement. Unfortunately, I purchased 2 starter kits right off the bat (1 as a gift) because of the high ratings I saw for this product. I would be able to use the towels and the bag but the mats will have to be replaced.",3
85854,Sizing ran small. The lettering is some kind of heat transfer. Wife ended up giving it away,3
