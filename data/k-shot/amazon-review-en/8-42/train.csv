84660,"I’m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn’t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn’t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don’t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.",3

105000,"There are things I like about these and things I don't. Pros: They take up very little space and make a lot of ice cubes. The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays. Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on). I like them and will keep using them, but my husband really doesn't care for them.",3

It has worn so thin in multiple spots that it’s no longer appropriate for wearing in public, I have to throw it away. This is unacceptable.",2
65426,Well it’s looks and feels okay but it most certainly does not have 4 pockets that’s a lie it has 3 so that’s pretty messed up to say it has 4 when it’s only 3 the fabric is super stiff hopefully after washing it will be better,2

The photo I included shows the top of the frame against the box, for straight edge reference. It does the job, and I needed to get this photo framed for a project I needed finished tomorrow. Next time I’ll get an assembled, wood or metal frame.",2

54783,It’s very hard to get the handle to lock in you need somebody strong to help you. I can’t get the handle down at all to put it in the car so The handle has to stay up. I’m almost 4 weeks in and it’s not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I’m off my feet because I don’t wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you’re not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times. Again this is for in-home use only but the handle falls off after a few weeks so I would maybe buy something else,2

9447,"It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.",1
