89986,Too big for my face. Look good & packages good!! Quick delivery!,3
101072,Not the size I hoped for but that could be partly my fault. It did come in a very nice gift bag with the brand name on it but I just wish that it was a bead or two larger. Otherwise this is a great gift for someone with a petite wrist.,3
106473,"I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus. I still give it 3 stars",3
112234,I suggest buying a size bigger than what you are. It is tight on the calves and arms.,3
98625,It was a nice product over all but trimmer Broke after a month.,3
112812,"Product as discribed, cracks very easily though. Seems cheap",3
92596,Pretty decent and sharp but the middle section gets stuck sometimes...kinda annoying,3
100163,My son really wanted this hoodie so when it arrived he was pleased. It is very thin however and there were several loose threads. The style is neat and different. For the price I was expecting something a little bit better quality however.,3
66400,Have not used this because we cannot figure this out,2
65429,the hinge broke after one year - not even a year of heavy use.,2
68411,"Easy to install*. Packaging was taped shut (like it was used), the paint on the shifter is marred (as if it was dropped). Other than the unfortunate scratches on the paint, they look very cool. Went ahead and installed it knowing that it’s a Jeep and we’re going to scratch them up anyway. If the paint wasn’t chipped, I’d give it 5 stars. *Install note: It is possible to remove the stock knob without destroying it. Just pop the lower chrome collar loose with a trim removal tool. Once that is free, the knob slides right off. (Same thing for the 4 Wheel transfer knob).",2
72464,"We have been big fans of PackIt products, as they last with our baby needs and children needs. We also love that we can throw them right into the freezer and they collapse, not taking up much space. I don’t know if there was a change in the product design, but in under three weeks our is already breaking on the inside liner.",2
66176,Product only lasted probably 10hrs before shorting out. Used it in bass amp for concerts. Would definitely purchase professional quality next time.,2
54402,never really worked. unable to get it to work..,2
41259,I can't say that this product is worth the price. They do not last long and this was my second set. The first ones I purchase broke almost immediately ..at least in time to be able to replace them. Now shortly after receiving the second set they too have broken. But when I checked to get them replaced the return date has passed. I am not happy with this item at all. On the up side my Grandsons LOVED them while they were working. Too bad they broke so quickly,2
78446,"I thought i was receiving two dog jackets. As shown in the picture. I only received the red coat. Picture is misleading and i am disappointed. I am a frequent buyer from amazon. Very disappointed, misleading with the picture above.",2
129464,"Very nice quality and incredibly soft. However, they are very thin so you need to fold them in order to wipe more easily, or you need to completely soak them in makeup removing product. It's fine, unless your product is a bit expensive and you only want to use a little, like me.",4
142387,"Since I have just received this product, I haven't had time to know for sure how it will benefit me. So far, so good.",4
142234,"Love them, but the volume is low. I can't hear them without speaker phone.",4
139136,"Ordered 18 of these lights to replace aging halogen outdoor landscape lights. All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.",4
150191,Easy to install and worked to pump fluid to my windshield.,4
128744,"A very solid watch band. A little heavy, and a little hard to adjust the sizing, but a good band.",4
129878,4/5 from a satisfied customer. I saw a similar product advertised on Facebook and searched for it on Amazon. This was the same product I saw and cheaper. It performs as its supposed to. Unfortunately the size of the glove is too big for my hand.,4
145012,"Great case overall, it's very hard and protects the phone very well. Only thing I dislike a little is the buttons are a bit hard to press, but you get used to over time.",4
9848,Only gave one because couldn’t leave no stars. This was the recommended case for the touch screen I got for the raspberry pi. With some drilling and creativity it can be made to work but it’s not an out of the box cover. No instructions either,1
6603,When I received this book the first 68 pages were missing. Absolutely unacceptable for even a used book. Makes no sense why it would be shipped like this,1
22725,The color cartridge does not work. I have tried everything that I can think of and my printer will not accept the color cartridge. I have to put the old color cartridge back in the printer just to be able to use the black cartridge.,1
809,"unbreathable item, I though it is because of the size; so I decided to replace the item but the issue as a customer you must pay for the refound shipping which cost around 4 dollars and the item itself 9 dollar .. doesn't make any sense !!!!",1
37747,The aspect ratio is so bad I could not watch it. I really wanted to. Why has this not been corrected? Something really out of whack.,1
19644,"Sadly, the pages were alllllll but 3 riped from the book. I wanted to return it but I was involved in a car accident and was unable to. But I’m disappointed that it was sent out in that condition.",1
9197,From 10 feet away people can see your eyes. Don't buy.,1
21614,"I wear a size 18/20 woman's t-shirt, blouse, etc. Sometimes they call this a 1X . So I ordered a XXL to be sure it would fit. I could barely get this t-shirt over my head and on. Once it was on I could barely breath. The quality & printing on the shirt are GREAT. If they let me return these I am going to order (4) XXXXL to replace them that's how impressed I was the quality.",1
166158,"Taste is better, works better and cheaper than 5 hour energy!",5
188687,"Perfect fit in my Kohler toilet. Identical to the original flapper it replaced. I checked the local Ace hardware store, thinking it would have to be cheaper, but the flapper on Amazon was actually three bucks cheaper.",5
163809,"Stick well, peel easy and stay on the wall. Exactly what I was hoping for my nursery. We had painted the walls and no damage done.",5

160067,"It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!",5
189057,"Buy a few days, come back to review after use, really good, absorb dust very quickly, inside have 2 bag to change wash, put on the table to use very convenient",5
