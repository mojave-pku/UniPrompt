93624,I absolutely love this high chair. The print is adorable and it is so lightweight it's perfect for a small house. My only complaint was the cover was not removable so when my son's diaper leaked on the non wipeable part of the fabric I had to cut and sew the cover to ensure that it was removable. Safety belts still come through and my son is still secure and I don't have to worry about gross stains where he eats. I'm not sure who thought non removable was a good idea for a high chair.,3

I needed to raise my monitor just a tad more than what was provided. So, I ordered another one just so I can raise my other stand.",3
92390,"Ok read... fun little book, and easy to read. Not sure I can give it more than 3 stars simply because those attracted to its message will have come to it for a purpose of sorts.

100737,"The first one I bought didn’t fit right so I purchased another, still no luck. The material is fine and they are the cutest thing ever. The problem is the leg area was too big.

99971,I like the layout of the days in the board and it fits my refrigerator fine. Those are the good points. The bad points are that only 2 of the round magnets actually function. The markers write but won't stay in the board with their magnets (plus they don't mark very well). Overall I'm happy with the board but the accesories are fairly useless.

The story is more focused on bringing the dark side of the Asian culture and in such a way that people who truly appreciate it may feel offended.

I bought the 2 large storage tree bags to break down my 9' tree and separate it into two bags so there would be no capacity issue. The handles may be heavy duty reinforced, but the remaining stitching of the bag is worthless. My tree comes in 4 parts. I put the middle two sections in one bag, zippered the bag and the seam split. The bottom section (largest and heaviest part of the tree) and the very top of the tree (smallest part) fit nicely in one bag, however when I went to zipper it up, one of the zippers fell off. I was glad there was a zipper on the other end of the bag to close it properly. I was not very happy with the product and I specifically bought two so I would not have this seam rip issue.

I knew something was wrong when I pulled out the very first bag. The plastic was different and it didn't have any ""give"" to it. Needless to say, every single one of them has ripped so far and over very stupid reasons. The corner of an Oreo bag made a 6 in tear and all I did was pick the trash bag up to move it 5 feet away. We are 10 for 10 on damaged trash bags. The worst part... We have a lot of cats. Several times now the torn bags have spilled dirty cat litter all over the floor.",1

19369,Unit didn't work. Too cheap to bother with replacement or refund.,1
20634,I have been very disappointed to not be able to find the American Crew Classic fragrance anymore seems It's been discontinued. I decided to try this one and while it lasts a long time it's a very very strong and just doesn't compare to the original. Wish I could have returned it but third-party seller not returnable,1
10265,I believe both of these lasted under 20 minutes with my boys. They ripped the squeaker out within that time and the rest of the toy fell apart. Shocked as most Kong items last with tough chewers but these did not. Would not buy my boys these again.,1
10897,"This was purchased as a gift. The first time the cutter was finally used was after any return period, and the extender measuring arm was glued at its base, so it could not be opened without breaking the connecting plastic. The cutter can no longer be used to make accurate measurements over the small size of the base piece. Very disappointed as this poor quality, especially from a Cricut product.",1
17061,Ordered black color and received red. Assembler from Amazon Home. Assembled for propane instead if natural gas and then refused to do it correctly saying “ call Amazon”,1
2705,"Normally I buy thistle from Walmart but they were out of stock for a few weeks so I ordered this product. I use socks and finches in my yard typically devour thistle like crazy until I bought this product. Cleaned socks and refilled and also tried using in a flat bird feeder and they still would not eat it. Once Walmart obtained inventory I bought it, dumped the Pennington seed and replaced with Walmart product. Birds are again happy feeders Pennington seed now in garbage.",1
33902,I ordered this item and received something completely different!! And I have no way to contact anyone to fix it. Product might work just never received the correct one.,1
6404,Dont buy them!!! They work for a couple of days only!!!! Waste of money!!,1
18222,Cheap for buying but initial use showed fraying of the wires in the belt!,1
8834,Very cheaply made! The pendant fell off the first time she wore it!!,1
386,"Ummm, no.....the ends of the rings are sharp, once you open the ring a little to put it in it's a major pain in the *** to squeeze it back closed, and the color on the colored ones is like a film of some sort that peels off (while I am wearing it!) if I wear it for more than about 24 hours (this was very embarrassing!). The one, and only one, plus for them is no skin reaction of any kind. Hence the 1 star. So again, NO....sorry, don't waste your time or money unless of course you like doing that sort of thing (NOT!).",1
5790,I was disappointed. You can see the colors and designs on the mat and they become more vivid with water. Doesn’t last 10 minutes either. Maybe 10 seconds.,1
16894,"I found it odd upon opening that the suction cup was smeared with a type of glue... 3 months later, under the hot California sun, the glue melted. I cleaned it off and realized that the suction cup was not made of the usual rubbery material but just soft plastic and could never have provided complete seal for suction. So some body must have screwed up in the design or manufacturing process and decided to work around it with glue! Well, look at the picture and you can see the result. It is a piece of trash now.",1
8977,I put it on last night and haven't dropped or mishandled my phone once yet somehow it's already got a fine crack in the glass. plus the very edges of the protector won't lie flat on the screen.,1
8894,"These are both too short, too sheer and have a funny gusset in the crotch. The waistband just sort of ends with no actual elastic so they don't stay up. Sadly, I wore them to work but will run out to buy a new pair cause it's too cold to go without tights. Don't buy these. I am 5' 10"" and 170 so a L/XXL should be fine but these are crap. I may send them back or ask for a refund because they suck.",1
35849,This did not work at all. Very disappointed!!!,1
29871,These are not BRIGHT AT ALL. In fact you have to really look at them to see they are lit at all. For the price I am very disappointed and would not recommend them.,1
5502,I bought two of these. Neither would program for use with my car. Do not buy this item.,1
36745,Clearly not packaged correctly and after sending a message asking how I’m supposed to return it looking like this I still haven’t heard back. I am usually never one to complain but I had to share. Very disappointed,1
43423,"I hate to leave a bad review because I really like how this works and using it to relieve stress. However, after just a few normal uses, the seam broke and spilled out the rice. I’m not sure if I got a defective product or if it is made poorly, but it’s really frustrating that it broke just a few days after the 30 day return window. It’s not like this is a super expensive item but I definitely would expect it to last more than 1 month for the price. I’m giving it a 2 because it worked well before it broke.",2
62557,"Pretty useless for anything other Than standard Folgers ground coffee. Forget trying to grind whole beans to use in this. The second anything other than a drug store Blend is in this filter, the machine freaks out and starts to overflow.",2
68767,Not very bright at all.,2
71771,"The first two boxes of these seemed good. Slightly thin, but good. The last box I received however is completely unusable. They stink like sulfur, and leave the smell on your hands also. Completely unusable for anything medical.",2
79125,It's a nice ring but colors are not as shown. I wanted a blue ring but that's not what I got,2
66654,"The product is slow and quirky, locks up and poor touch screen. I have geek squad on it many times still happening. Wish I could send it back but we took it on an extended trip and it was nit possible.",2
71397,Not for me. I tried to get ingredients list before buying - I was allergic to some ingredients. I gave it to a neighbor,2
49613,"The picture and description of the item is misleading. They are paint makers, not good for glass or stone. Very misleading",2
79518,They are hard plastic and I feel that once they are on. Putting them on is a hassle. I cannot reach around and put them on once the bra is on and it is almost impossible to put them on first and turn the bra around. I live alone and needed someone to help me with them. Not for me but maybe okay for others.,2
60372,I ordered the correct part but when I tried to line the holes up they didn't match. The holes in the rail were about 1/32 of an inch off. The screws were also the wrong ones. Wrong thread. I sent it back. It looked good. Seemed to be well made and if it fit probably would have been excellent.,2
43701,Some items were of better quality than others.. some items only lasted 5 mins with my dog who isn't an active chewer.,2
60923,It will cover the case but that's it. It's not a snug fit and adds a lot of bulk to the case. It needs to be thinner and tighter.,2
73050,"Two day shipping meant five days to start off with then when I installed the fixture today, both ends were bent, the light bulb receptacles had to be bent and manipulated to make them appear straight and one of the cages that hangs down is broken. After all of the rigging I had to do to it to make it work, it’s not worth it to return the light but I could have gotten better quality for this price at a big box store. Disappointed..",2

58937,Look nice but start peeling in area where magnet strap is,2
61580,Followed instructions but still leaking badly.,2
72319,"After using just a little of the bottle, the pump broke on one bottle and on the other bottle the entire pump broke off spilling the entire contents, what a wast, cheap design.",2
69163,Bought this for the interval timer and heart rate monitor. Very disappointed to find out there is no heart rate monitor as shown in the photos. Interval timer works as needed.,2
63322,"Does not quite fit, as it does not cover the screen entirely, so it creates a weird line on both long sides of the screen.",2
75734,Doesn't have very long range and needs kinect to do tv,2
41477,"OK. I am officially done buying cheap garden hoses. Seriously. This thing burst in 32 days. Yes, I left the hose spigot on, but we didn't even break 90 degrees a single day during the month that I had this hose. It burst and was useless in literally 32 days. Amazon, thankfully, accepted my exchange on this hose, even though it was outside of the return window. But now, I am about 15 days into my second hose, and I just can't take the kinks! Literally kinks just by pulling it out. I am returning this hose and buying a hose that is more than twice the price of this one - and 30' shorter! Hoping that 'more money' doesn't equal 'more problems' in this scenario. I, for one, am completely done buying these multi-ply hoses. I am going to invest more in heavy duty, all rubber hoses, and hope that they last longer than a month! Any hose brand that claims ""never kink"" - either in the product title or product description, is a liar - and most likely, their hose kinks worse than any hose you've ever owned! Who would have thought that I would start critiquing garden hoses! I guess they are right - your interests change greatly as you age.",2
52097,Works but camera is pretty blurry. Would not recommend.,2
45795,"The picture shows 2 jars which I expected to receive. The fine print says 1 pc. Its quite deceiving and wrong. If i had known it was only One, I would've gotten something else. Its quite irritating.",2
61134,This product doesn't last long.. It was fine for 1-2 months. later it's not working at all.,2
78286,on the plus side this is the longest I've had a kettle last... are they all so cheap?,2
63253,"I usually buy these from Whole Foods stores, so I tried the convenience of Amazon to my doorstep. What a mistake. Half of the noodle packages contained awful, defective, scrawny, chewy gross noodles which I had to throw out.",2
47299,"Not useable. The vertical bar was clearly cut at a slight angle at the bottom. Upon tightening the screws, the bar goes totally crooked, meaning that the tv would be crooked. Seems like pretty solid build quality and weight, it’s just sloppy... Returning unless the new vertical piece can be sent.",2
58432,Came with only one case and a dozen plugs. Nonsense.,2
55441,Roller keeps falling off most of these bottles. So disappointed as I use these for items that I sell.,2
64993,Can't really get an accurate reading.,2
70257,Really needed orange for thanksgiving project and got a tea/green colored “yellow” which doesn’t coordinate with anything. Two stars for speedy delivery.,2
40450,Item came in excellent packaging and in a timely manner. The reason for the 2 stars is because it contains high fructose corn syrup and it was purchased for my disabled husband and he can't eat food with this ingredient and I wouldn't have purchased if known otherwise.,2
46186,The hat did not fit my head. Looked weird. Also the logo wasn't horizontal,2
78025,Was disappointed with this shirt. It was very heavy spandex type fabric that is a fitted size. Not the loose flowy style in the picture.,2
41300,"It is very gentle on your head and works if you get it positioned just right. It's pretty easy to knock it off, though. Could be more snug - my head is not small at all. After wearing one regularly for a month, the inside padding started peeling apart.",2
47647,"They aren’t sealed, none of them are. So how do I know if they are actually new? I read reviews before purchasing and they said each one was sealed - not accurate. Missing the regular label you would see if you purchased a normal one. I took a picture of what a new sealed one looks like (vanilla one in picture)",2
78635,Box damaged and ripped open.,2
70224,"It arrived properly sealed. It had no smell to it, I tried to smell it, it was a very weak vanilla smell. I started my vanilla extract on March 28, 2019. I'll see how the extract turns it in June when is completed.",2

61801,"My daughter is 11 and catches. The bag was the perfect color for her team and fit all her catching gear. It would have been great but after 2 uses the bottom is getting holes in it. SUPER disappointed, so is my daughter.",2
52658,Cat had no interest. Not fault of the product.,2
75822,I am dissatisfied with the durag since it doesn't fit properly on my son's head. It doesn't compress the waves on his hair. So the purchase was a total waste of money.,2
49565,All items werent not in the pack. I only received 6 slap bracelets and several items were not as described. Now I have to run out and buy more from party supply store to finish party favor bags. not worth it.,2
43956,I liked this case when I first got it but about a year later it has began to fall apart. Pieces have chipped off leaving sharp edges and exposed areas. I will be ordering something different to replace it.,2
50308,"I started playing with my daughter and she absolutely loved it, but I didn't realize That you get almost no words included, and unfortunately I do not have $30 to spend on an app. I have never even seen an app cost that much before.",2
58514,ok came with the dropper glass broken,2
44765,"Yuck! These chocolate coconut bars are the worst I've ever tasted. Waxy with a distinctive protein taste that I have not experienced in any other bar. I'll choke them down since I paid for them, but I'm glad I got the small pack. So far the Costco Kirkland signature bars are the best and they even have a lot of fiber.",2
58485,"These smell really gross — kinda like men’s shaving cream, and the mask doesn’t work very well.",2
51995,"Had it in my pocket most of the time, didnt use it too much at all and it just fell apart",2
51676,This is not a good quality paper. Let the kids have this paper and spend a bit more for Arches or Strathmore paper,2
50644,Turntable didn't turn. Looks nice but doesn't feel like a quality turntable. I bought this for my husband and had to return it. I will shop in person for the next one.,2

77217,Not an accurate thermometer,2
45618,"The positive is that it looks great (we stained the outer bit of the wood to be a bit darker) and works for our purposes. However, I am just not happy with the QC for this product. One of the long panels was cut with two female ends rather than a male and female as the other 3 sides were, so it wouldn't go together securely. The thing was very heavy and I was not about to attempt to find a box to put it in to return (as the box it came in had to be completely destroyed to get this out as they had taped and stapled all the pieces to the inside of the box) so we just put that corner in the back and used some extra long deck screws to try to pull them together as best we could. I emailed Suncast and have yet to hear a response after over 2 months so that was not a mark in their favor either. We went with a different company for the second deck box we needed for by our pool instead of getting the same one (this one) we got for the deck because of this.",2
74782,This is not 1200 lm more like 800,2
60642,This cable keeps disconnecting from my iPhone 8 plus. The sound quality is horrible. I highly advise the next person buying it reads this comment. But cool color!,2
47923,"Amazingly bright! Lights up the area with daylight brightness. Once you are 3 feet from the motion detector. I had to wired my old motion / daylight detector in to the circuit.

42943,"These are soft pillows, but not super soft or fluffy. And, not really supportive soft, like I've found hotel pillows. The description and reviews indicated that the pillow is ""hotel quality, soft and supportive"". It comes with instructions that explain to give them time to fluff after being opened (they are vacuum sealed), and, fluff by hand. I did both, and still they aren't that fluffy. I also contacted the company before I wrote this review, as they send those emails because they care about their customers, and I never heard back. Anyway, hope this review helps someone who needs it. Blessings.",2
46128,Side pockets too small for anything significant.,2
42819,"I received the 70 calorie Brownie, Mint Fudge. It is nice that there are fewer calories, but unfortunately along with those 20 calories a lot of the flavor was also lost. The original 90 calorie recipe was moist and tasty. The 70 calorie variety is somewhat dry and less flavorful. I will no longer be purchasing these.",2
130316,Product was as described but it just didn't work for me. I was really big when I ordered so it didn't provide much relief. Still was a good product.,4

141688,"These do indeed appear to reduce the vibration noise generated by our large freezer-on-the-bottom fridge. But here's the thing to be aware of... The thought that you can put the pads under the rear rollers and slide back into position (as per the instructions) is a farce. Between the weight of the fridge, and the rubber of the pads, they simply do not slide on the floor. At all. They sit put and the rollers simply roll right over the small top lip of the pad. I even tried to oil the floor, hoping they would glide on a slick surface. No, Ended up having to place the fridge in place, and with the aid of a helper, tilt it forward and push the rear pads into place with a stick while looking under the fridge with a flashlight. Then (much easier), tilting the fridge backwards and placing the front pads in place. Bottom line is this... they do seem to work well, but installing them was a pain in the neck. Almost too much so.",4

I saw a small improvement in my closed comedones. I liked the product so much I encouraged my sister to use this product to and she saw a quick reduction in her active hormonal acne in about two weeks using it one nightly.",4
146603,"Ran a little big on me, but I would rather it be loose than tight. I may put it in the dryer and try to shrink it a little if it bothers me while wearing it. In fairness, I bought a 2x and I probably needed the lx. I thought it might run small because of the price.",4

158685,"This wallet is amazing. The only reason I don’t leave a 5-star review is that the keychain was not made for a small amount of keys, it’s either you have 4 keys or you have over 8, the bolts weren’t built for for example 5 or 6 keys. Otherwise, this product is a must have for all men! Definitely recommended, sturdy, solid, overall great! Go buy it.",4

It’s sturdy, the glossy emblem looks great and comes with all the hardware. Plus I like the fact it actually has the plate slide in and is held by the frame itself. Not to pick nits.

I can't give a rating on durability because I have not had the case very long (about a month) It seems to be durable. I have had similar cases that have lasted a long time. The phone does not fall out of the case and I like the raised edge around the face of the phone to prevent screen cracking. I like the color of my phone and the clear case was a great choice as it fully displays the phone. Overall I am happy with this purchase.",4

Put together dresser, desk, nightstand and other apt items no problem. Cons: needs a multi blade small hand saw had to buy one separately. Also doesn’t come with basic screws/nails for hanging pictures or any electrical or duct tape. Adjustable wrench would also be a plus. All in all a decent set for the price. Just know what you need when comparing - no one needs a 100 piece set where they count items you will never use.",4
157049,"This is a lovely set of 10 fancy fashion doll dresses for 11.5 inch dolls. The dresses are handmade with Velcro closures, and in random colors and styles. I like that they fit both newer and older style barbie dolls, and that the Velcro closures make them easy to put on and remove. They are of decent quality and the assortment I received is very nice, without any repeats, although four dresses do have the same bottom lace. I had to trim a couple of threads that were sticking out but nothing major, and the Velcro closures feel quite strong. I received the following dresses in my set: 1 red dress with lots of lace and a bow with hearts on the top, 1 dress with a white top and layered ruffles in purple, pink, and blue, 3 blue dresses, 1 with multi-colored metallic droplets covering the dress, 1 with a bow around the waist and pink dotted lace, 1 with a neck ruffle and pink and white floral lace, 1 white dress with silver butterfly wings on the top, 2 purple dresses with different styles of lace trim on the top, and pink and white floral lace on the bottom, and lastly 2 pink dresses, 1 with lace and darker pink on the top, and pink and white floral lace on the bottom, and 1 with sequined ruffles. I like this set of dresses a lot, and I would definitely recommend it to others.",4

This is good seller and you have nothing to lose by trying this product. If it works, then that's awesome. If not, you can get a refund. That being said, this product did not help our dog. We have a 14 year old female shepherd-hound mix who has developed separation anxiety. We were hoping these would help, but, although she enjoys eating them, she still barks constantly and gets very agitated when left alone.",4
135780,"Fit a 2007 Honda Civic LX, got the A/C running. The two snap rings included didn't fit, the included shims were a different size than the existing parts. I used the old snap rings, shim, and nut. The splash guards inside the wheel well and the front of the engine needed to be removed, to get at the compressor from below. A number of the plastic clips broke and needed replacing. The A/C Compressor didn't need to be removed, but needed to be unbolted from the engine to create space to remove the pulley and coil. Needed a fairly narrow set of 8"" external snap ring pliers to remove the coil. 6"" didn't get deep enough, adjustable square nose pliers didn't have enough space to open. The new pulley was a tight fit, engine assembly lube helped push it onto the spindle.",4

125386,I can’t mark anything for durability yet bc I’ve only had it a few days. But the case exceeded my expectations when I was searching for a soft jelly like feel type of case. I went with the softer more pastel yellow. Which is incredibly cute but I should have went with more of a mustard for my personal style. The open front case made for easy installation. Previous cases similar in the past are all jelly like silicone through and through. This one caught my attention as soon as I opened the package due to the back part which my phone sits on is lined with a thin layer of suede or a suede like material. This has been the best case I’ve gotten for my iPhone. If you have a tempered screen then the jelly case is the perfect amount of protection. I will look into more colors and variety and will definitely look at this seller first.,4
