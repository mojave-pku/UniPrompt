Also, it's not going to provide much cushion against the rigid edge of the polycarbonate main cylinder which, by design, will be pressing firmly against the body.

I'm skinny and weigh 140 lbs and the chair has just enough space to fit me. The padding is not soft but im not expecting anything more considering its price.

My entire house is hardwood except for 2 large thin low pile rugs which this thing doesn't even clean. And the intelligent ""sensors"" that prevent it from hitting walls is BS. It literally runs full speed into walls and then stumbles for a second once the bumper is hit, moves an inch to the side and runs into the wall again. Look at the pictures of paint scraping off, that was before the stair carnage. 1st time I used it the damn thing stayed under my kitchen table for 20+ minutes despite me pulling all the chairs out.

It’s also awkward to put on since you’re trying to pull the male end toward the female instead of the other way around. The holes are slightly too small for the peg and you really have to force it.

28581,"I initially loved this armband however there is one very GIANT flaw: the way it connects is not via a magnet, but rather 2 small little clips that hold the metal square which have indentations on the sides. The problem is, if running or moving your arms in any way, the fit is not snug and the weight of the phone (I have an iphone 7) pulls the metal up and away from the backplate and it makes a clicking noise...with every single arm movement. It is driving me crazy! If that small circle in the center is actually a magnet, it is not nearly strong enough to do anything with real movement. If it had a powerful magnet that would actually keep the 2 metal pieces from separating, it would be great. Very bummed. I bought a new case just to be able to use this (my old case was textured and thus it wouldn't adhere). One other thing that bothers me is constantly having the metal square on the back on the phone. It's slippery when you put the phone down face up and any gripping quality of your case is irrelevant, unless you put your phone facedown and can't see the screen. And, pressing the home button while flat on a table and the phone tips/rocks, which is also just an annoyance to be aware of.",1

That makes the curtains about 2 inches short. One curtain panel has two flaws in it. I wanted the curtains hung for the holidays so it’s up with the flaws. The curtains themselves I like the shear material. But, they do have puckers in them on the seams lines. I did iron them before hanging. For the price the quality would be somewhat appropriate.",2

On the up side the magnetic driver is a life saver, at least I didn't lose any screws into the abyss!

One of the male customers on Amazon gave feedback and called it a nut and bolt and he is exactly right i thought he was just joking when I read his review. He was not joking at all. This little device has a little bolt and you screw the back on. It will not even leave a tiny hole in your garment, it will damage your garment and leave a large hole in it. I telephone the company and told them that it is regulation size and the eagle globe and anchor look really good,but the back of this device is not for a collar. Do yourself a favor as I will do, go to an Army surplus store in your area and all the branches are there. The lady that I spoke to at this company didn't really give a rip.

Holds my head up way to high like I have my so lifted my necks kinked too far above from the rest of my body.

I was hoping this would be like the Sesame Street I remember (not completely Elmo-centric, but very kid friendly with lots of Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Grover, Ernie and Bert, etc..). It's not. It's like a mix between sketch comedy and some educational bits. Interesting to see how the show originated and to see life in the 1970s, but not what I was looking for and not what I remember from the 80s. Also, each disc only has one full episode. And the disc starts with a warning that it's for adults and not appropriate for today's preschoolers.

It wasn't taped up good at all, dents all in the box and my daughter had to ask the clerk in the mail station to give her some tape just to take the bottom of the box up enough so it would the printer wouldn't fall out the bottom before she could get it home. Then she opens it up and finds that the copy paper we purchased was opened and pretty much all the paper was outside the package. What in the world has happened?

It's not asthetically pleasing, but that's just personal preference. Overall, it's a good affordable product that does what it's supposed to do. I wouldn't use it for anything bigger than a 15 gallon tank though. Pros: - works as intended - quiet - clear housing, so you can see what has accumulated inside without having to take it apart. - easy setup and maintenance - adjustable flow rate Cons: - filter pad needs to be replaced (not a deal breaker) - not asthetically pleasing in nano planted tank - the wire is a little short - the plastic material doesn't feel as durable as other brands, so I would handle with care during maintenance.

134369,"I haven’t yet finished this book ,I am embarrassed to say although I am enjoying it so much I think I am trying to stretch it out . I have really enjoyed reading about Roberts early days and his family and friends and how his love for music really became his driving force for his life. I love that he was just a fan of rock and roll and blues and just decided to try to be a singer and then just was! I think that’s everybody’s dream .
