84660,"I’m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn’t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn’t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don’t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.",3

Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on). I like them and will keep using them, but my husband really doesn't care for them.",3

106473,"I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus. I still give it 3 stars",3

The directions are easy enough to follow and you can quickly put one of these together. Main pain points: two chairs- one had an extra screw, the other had two defective screws. One chair had a washer for the “neck” piece, the other didn’t. Biggest issue, whether you use a drill or screw driver, you will see the tips of the screws poke through the face of the animal (see picture). If you try to avoid this and don’t screw them in as far, you’re left with a wobbly chair. A disappointing finish to what could be a great piece.",3

54783,It’s very hard to get the handle to lock in you need somebody strong to help you. I can’t get the handle down at all to put it in the car so The handle has to stay up. I’m almost 4 weeks in and it’s not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I’m off my feet because I don’t wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you’re not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times.

They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.",4
