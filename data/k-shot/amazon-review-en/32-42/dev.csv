93810,This does seem to extend the length of my manicure but I don't find it the miracle product others do. I get maybe 5-7 days instead of 2-3 out of my polish with this.,3

108228,"I really like the design of the backpack, but it is not practical for a college student. This is a good backpack to hold maybe 2 books. There‚Äôs days where I walk almost 2 miles because of my classes and my back is hurting and aching. It‚Äôs a very bulky backpack and doesn‚Äôt fit much in it. I have to shove things back in if I take something out. I also cannot have my 15‚Äù laptop in it without taking something else out. It also smelled strong of plastic when I first got it. I‚Äôm going to be upgrading from this backpack.",3
87441,"I bought two units and overall love the mobile music. Both units were processed the exact same. While listening to them, my second unit's battery only lasted about 20 hours. The first unit still showed full charge! I just downloaded the Monster phone app so going to see how that works later today. Great sound, variable battery life.",3
118764,You will need to pump ut up a lot to get more than a single spray from this. Disappointing but looks nice if you don't mind the extra work.,3
93429,This book was chosen for book club. I was initially interested and then quickly lost interest. I found it hard to follow at times and lost interest quickly. It was hard to finish and I only had about 15 pages left to read before book club and just never had the interest to finish the last pages.....,3
96288,"Only giving it three stars because the charger works fine, but I put a screen protector on 3 days ago and it‚Äôs already cracked. I don‚Äôt do anything ridiculously rough to my watch but it shouldn‚Äôt crack after three days.",3
107695,"Be careful, the small allen screw that holds the light stripped after adjustment. The company should at least use stronger material screws.",3
83227,Beautiful item but the glass cross was broken in 4 pieces when I opened the box due to no packing material. Needed ASAP for a gift.,3
96796,The waist is too high and the bottom too long. I could get away with it but I like my leggings to be be fitted. I might have them altered or I send them back. Not sure yet. Fabric is on the thin size but not see through. Expected for the price. I am 5.2 so I would recommend for taller people! It adjusts well to my size which I am small/medium legging size. Perhaps they could create a petite size!,3
96423,Order these 3 times.. the first 2 times the lighters were good but the 3rd time I got a different set of lighters that were hard to spark & seem to be of cheaper quality,3
109057,Needed to flash it to get it working with my NVR system (shinobi). Seems to be working now.,3

106524,"Worked great on the first bottles of shampoo & conditioner, when I switched them to the new bottles 1 of them quit working.",3
104094,I have wavy hair and I thought this would enhance my waves. It did nothing actually and didn't tame the frizz at all. I'm highly disappointed.,3
101160,"Meh. They cut out some noise, but don't make a great seal. Comfortable, though - made of soft silicone - and at least they don't fall out. They fit pretty tight in the carrying case, so that I usually have to pry them out with my pen knife.",3
115988,"It looks good, but the problem with this, IMHO, is that the optional extenders are of equal width. They need to vary. It's just a smidge too wide for where I need it with both extenders, but a bit too small if I use only one of them. The screws, then, are extended to their maximum amount not allowing for tightening. The gate is purposely agape to adjust to the tightening of the tension screws. You tighten up until the door meets the latch. Right now, I have it fit sort of kitty-corner between the two walls which is not ideal as I can't keep it at the proper tension. I'm only using this for a front patio to keep the dog from running out which is working fine, otherwise, it's a bit disappointing and annoying.",3
90906,"The second day (in a row) we used it, didn't hold the air anymore.",3
88858,they are nice but not as good of a material as i would have liked.,3
81918,I returned to this product,3
104231,Great pump but the gauge is waaaaaay off,3
96369,I‚Äôve only been using it for a week and the silicone is already ripped on the side of some keys. The durability is not good.,3

49011,*** update The handles have worn out and one of them broke off. I still use it but it's no longer as useful. At least it still holds stuff. Original comment: Works great. Durable. I ended up buying 2 of these after having my first. Do wish there was some sort of expandable strap for carrying on shoulder or in one hand. Great product.,2
75583,Stopped working after 3rd light yard work. Chain just scrolls. Too late for Amazon return. I liked how lightweight it was.,2

I never put it on auto order either. I don't want anyone choosing what and when I order my stuff. Now I am chg for this and I may have enough already for the year. The batters will be dead by the time I use the one sent today. What is going other. Never hd any problems with other seller. I am not happy! The balls are wonderful otherwise.",2

65507,Lightning plug sunk down in just over a month and the adapter was unable to be repaired.,2

62418,Purchased 8 months ago and both broken now.,2
78562,It looks easier than it is. I ran around trying to fill this thing with air and it took several tries. I looked ridiculous. Finally got enough air in it to make it work. I sat on it then fell right off. I really think I am missing something. My 12-year old had trouble staying on it as well. We left it next to the tent that night and must have gotten rain because in the morning the thing had water in it...actually inside the liner. Not able to get the water out...and worried about mold...it ended up in the trash. Pretty bummed. The idea is great if it had worked for us.,2
40551,I have been using these types of braces for years for Ms foot drop.. I was excited for a black color. The strap was over a foot long and had to be wrapped around twice and just slid off the back of my leg. Poorly designed.,2
76091,"Not sure what the point of the book was. Learned almost nothing that I didn't know about the Donner party. The characters were truly ridiculous. The storytelling which started out ok, just became boring almost to the point of being tedious. The ending was just as dull and anti-climactic. I bought this based on Stephen King's review. His books are better than his reviews are.",2
62761,I could not get the lights to stay in position. I tried tightening them but got no better results. I wanted to aim them where the light would be best for my seedlings and was not satisfied with the results.,2
43208,"Sadly, it was too small.",2
68458,My son used this for approx. 5 months and it's got holes on the bottom fabric and sides (in various places). I would not spend $100 on a product that doesn't even last. Disappointed.,2

152038,Great quality for a reasonable price. I used this at a baby shower I hosted and everyone was impressed! SO pretty!!,4
120595,"I got these because i saw them featured (not this particular brand) on a talk show. They are nice, and will keep out the sun from damaging your eyes and causing wrinkles....very cool!",4

155349,Is OK but runs small,4
140993,"I ordered a size up because my butt is larger than the rest of me, and like every other pair of jeans/shorts I buy, the waist is too big. You can see my underwear in these if I don‚Äôt have something underneath. They are good quality though.",4
140570,I just wish it would save the names.,4
121773,"Great knife for the money. As other reviews have noted, this is a bulky knife. Not something you‚Äôd want to carry in your pocket everyday. Blade is nice and solid/thick, and sharp, but the action is not as smooth or lightening fast as I was hoping it would be. Overall, solid everyday work knife for sure!",4

134683,"Overall good product, except for handset screen could be brighter to read",4
149023,I like the colors and the staying power of these glosses. A good value for my money. They are a bit sticky so only 4 stars.,4
141647,This a great case for the price. It looks great while also providing the protection that I need for my iPhone.,4
126670,Excellent product - feels great and very therapeutic. My massage therapist recommended this for reflexology.,4
147138,"Let me first say that this mouse was the perfect shape, weight, and in my opinion the ideal mouse for any FPS. It just isn't compatible with the microsoft surfacebook 2. It freezes and jumps around every so often.",4
138412,It was the perfect gift for a family member who enjoys handheld poker electronic games. My reason for 4 stars is that it has a small screen.,4
129241,Only complaint is that it's battery operated only for the sound machine and vibration. Both were much needed for a newborn. Very disappointed that it didn't come with a plug option. Otherwise it looks great and great quality.,4
155995,Cute and a great piece to wear for any costume,4
146735,I like these bands! Colors are bright and vibrant. My only gripe is the two holders for the excess band slide too easy.,4
155058,"Pretty easy to assemble. The quality is decent I just wish it was taller to watch movie while sitting in chairs. The screen is pretty short. Originally I put it up for movie and it fell back cause of strong winds, good thing it came with stakes and rope to stake it down for stability.",4
155395,Great info from a history buff,4
149807,"This is a great purchase for the price. Works great, speed is great and i appreciate that it comes with the extra blade replacement pieces. My only complaint is that it does not come with a plug for the USB cord, thought that was odd. But considering the savings, compared to $15 for most electric sharpeners and the fact that most items we have use USB cords, we are fully stocked. That was the only reason for 4 out of 5 stars",4
157289,"I was skeptical about ordering this, but thought anything had to be better than what we had. We got it out of the box and into the camper. We have not slept on it yet. But we have laid on it for couple minutes and so far I am super impressed. I am debating on replacing our bunk beds as well. Well worth the money. Only reason I‚Äôm rating it 4 stars is because we have not slept a night on it yet.",4
128657,Cute his and her keychains. Very sturdy,4
134853,"They are pretty cool, but don‚Äôt drop them. Very easy to dent the metal ring.",4
142262,The Bottoms Did Not Fit My height,4
130936,We like that it‚Äôs insulated and we like that it‚Äôs unbreakable. It Is hard to press sometimes though. I don‚Äôt know if this is because the grind we are using is too fine? It is aesthetically pleasing. Overall we are very happy thank you.,4
140064,These were perfect size to go inside the ACE bandage I was wearing. The sleeve kept it from direct skin contact but allowed the cold through. These were somewhat difficult to activate but this prevented accidentally breaking the inner bubble.,4
157959,"I loved the variety of colors and craftsmanship of each bow. Beautifully made. The clips, however, will not clamp onto the hair causing the bows to fall off of the hair.",4
141982,"Be careful when tightening the fittings, especially the fittings in the Tankless heater, ensure you use a wrench to hold the fitting there not to twist off or damage the copper fitting piping inside the heater. And use the right size wrench and not pliers or channel locks, because you can damage or round off the the edges of fittings. Phasing the fittings is easy to get the alignment you need.",4
137110,"Nice headphones for the price. I love the rich rose gold color that matches my iPhone and accessories. The sound is really good and everyone can hear me clear as well. The music clarity is good and has a nice volume level. The only thing is the distance of the headset to the phone is a little short for good reception. It even announces the caller by name or number. Overall, I like this product.",4
143244,The story is gripping and it really draws you in. My only complaint is the author seemed to bounce around a bit and didn‚Äôt explain who was whom very well.,4
142791,"I was hesitant on these, my wife bought them. I installed them and am very pleased with the look and function.",4
39479,Just got the case and it‚Äôs too small. What the heck??? Anyone else had this problem???,1
37469,I really want to give this suit a 5 star but I can‚Äôt. The appearance is beautiful and I love the color. But sadly the top is to big. I followed the sizing chart for around the bust size. It all fits there but the cup size in a xxl looks as if it is a triple d or a double d. I am a larger girl being 249 but my chest is smaller. Would love to exchange sizes but cant find anywhere to message sender.,1
31069,Watch came without extra sizing links. Cannot purchase the links without purchasing a new $180 band. Will be returning,1

13066,There isnt enough glue to stick it on your eye and make it stay. Not worth the money and it isnt eligible for returns sadly.,1
20468,Fake!! These are fake pens. They do not work!! I ordered these to use as back up to my digital bill detector. I keep a fake $100 in the office of my restaurant to help train staff. It‚Äôs a known fake. The digital detector caught the bill so I know it‚Äôs fake. These pens show that it‚Äôs real!! I have other fake bills used for training staff and it says those are real as well. Come on amazon!! Stop letting people sell fake stuff on here!!,1
39436,"I used this wax on my entire body, I had to go over areas on my legs more than once. I used the entire can and ultimately had to shave afterwards because the wax was not working. For legs, arms, underarm, etc I had to use a razor after to clean it up. For Brazilian front and back, the front was ok I still had to go over with a razor and the back didn't really work I had to just shave. The hair grew back faster than usual Im guessing because I pretty much shaved (since the wax didn't remove the hairs). I have course curly hairs but Ive never had a wax not work. I've been waxing for a while and this has to be the worse wax. Ive paid less for waxes that work on all of my body parts leaving it smooth for weeks. I bought this wax and had to go back to razors and razors are terrible for me due to the amount of ingrowns after. Highly disappointed and upset I wasted money.",1

6540,"so, this thing is like a big fat crochet hook designed to grab the inside lip of the jacuzzi ball and pull. Which would be great, except that it's ONE QUARTER INCH TOO SHORT. Maybe Kohler changed their design to make it deeper, or something, but this tool is next to USELESS for removing jets from my tub. Instead of the ball lip, all you can ""grab"" is the sloped ledge inside the ball, which with a LOT of persistence and side pressure might eventually get the insert to let go. We finally ""modified"" the tool by melting portions of the stop-ball away, making it more functional and much less pretty. Caveat Emptor.",1
