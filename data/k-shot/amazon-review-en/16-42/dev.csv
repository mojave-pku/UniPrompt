112903,Its o.k. but not as thick as another brand I previously used. I think the other brand lasted longer in my hair for the day.,3

80569,"I have never ordered this brand but heard great things, not sure if those brown areas are normal or not",3
107074,"For some reason, I bought these to ride my bike with in the cold. They suck for that. Not bad for just walking around, though. I didn't know they were touchscreen compatible til I saw the description again, so I can't comment on how well they work on a cellphone.",3
85450,"This chair is fine. It's a little too rolly, also it doesn't recline unless you pull the lever, which is a little weird but I guess I get it. Okay chair--you get what you pay for.",3
107681,"I bought two chairs and was super excited to put them together. These are definitely cute and are nice quality. The directions are easy enough to follow and you can quickly put one of these together. Main pain points: two chairs- one had an extra screw, the other had two defective screws. One chair had a washer for the “neck” piece, the other didn’t. Biggest issue, whether you use a drill or screw driver, you will see the tips of the screws poke through the face of the animal (see picture). If you try to avoid this and don’t screw them in as far, you’re left with a wobbly chair. A disappointing finish to what could be a great piece.",3
113760,"I bought this a little over three months ago, and while I thought it was a good bag up until now, the bag's strap snapped as I picked it up while leaving the gym. I'd recommend this bag if you need something on the cheaper side but I'm not sure if just my bag is like this or if this is routine.",3
100677,Update: Its ok diaper cream. It separates very easily and it does have a very ROSE LIKE smell. I am still going to use it but not sure I will keep using this brand. I prefer the Target and Walmart brand better so far.,3
107244,"Overall product is well constructed, Holds a charge well 2 or 3 uses before recharging. The fit is well for me and my wife however,the range is only about 4 tractor trailer lengths away before losing contact and the sound quality is not what I expected for what I paid...its not a packed crisp sound...but more or less a crackly weak sound, not a bad product , I just want the reader to know what yo expect before you spend over 300.00 like I did expecting a little more.",3
115626,"It's a decent hat for the price. For me, the stitching was odd so the hat looked cheaply made. But that's just me, I'm quite picky. Overall it's a decent hat for the price.",3
113697,"I learned a lot about George, about Eric, about the hippie London of earlier 60s. Also now I think Pattie is an extraordinary woman and I am glad that I can see at that juicy part of history in a different and more healthy light.",3
101935,I have lots of problems with this rice cooker because the liquid often steams out and the rice doesn't get enough liquid. There is no hole in the lid to allow some steam out.,3
101238,i think that says it all .,3
117568,"I read anothers review of this item and agree, the doors are tough to hang straight. Also be careful of the backing screws as in the middle front lower shelf you can see how the screws broke away the bottom shelf. Otherwise its great!",3

70579,"This fascinator looked cute when I did not move, but it was too heavy to stay in place. I used the clip on the headband, but the whole thing kept falling forward on my forehead. At the Derby party, I tried taking it off the headband and just clipping it to my hair, but it still was too heavy to stay in place and kept sliding down. It was uncomfortable, and I finally just had to take it off so it did not fall down into my mint julep. :)",2
52780,Do yourself a favor and check it out from the library before buying this book. Wish I had. Trust your gut instinct. That's it. Nothing more.,2
43736,"Much smaller than anticipated, the picture looks like it’s a man’s bracelet when in reality it’s more for a woman. The clasp is impossible to use one handed making it impossible to put on alone, must have help. I will be returning and not recommending this to anyone.",2
56899,"The top was a bit tight and I'm a 36 B. I got a medium. I prob would still wear top but underboob is inevitable since the straps are not adjustable. Otherwise the top was cute. Bottoms fit weird and where the strappy parts are on each side the inner lining (tan/white material) showed no matter what and looked super odd. Not cute at all. Maybe I am just too wide for them. I have a 26"" waist. Def for SHORT PETITE people.",2
44127,"I gave this mascara 2 stars, because I would love to use it; although I cannot. The wand is in very poor condition, the brush fibers are falling off and are crushed. For $28 I am very, very disappointed. It did not appear in great, new condition when it arrived.",2
62579,"Lasted a whopping two weeks before it ripped with minimal usage of my AirPods. Not worth the money but too late to return. On the plus size, it was easy to install and looked really nice before it ripped. Maybe I got a bad batch?",2

41268,"I wasn't so excited to get this float but I will be returning it. Immediately upon inflating it I discovered a large tear in the stitching. The tear doesn't let air out, but since its along the stitching I can tell it will only get worse. Other than the tear the float is very nice and I'm sure I would have spent many happy pool days in it.",2
51623,nice gag gift but rather small,2
46601,"I’m disappointed. Toilet is fully functional and reasonably priced,.... but... the casting is out of level, both the base and tank. The problem was obvious once the tank was installed, since the tile behind the toilet was level and called attention to the issue. The fix was to install galvanized shims under the bowl and between the tank and bowl. Not a perfect answer, but the problem was less noticeable. I would have been better off paying $20 more for a different toilet, manufactured with better quality control.",2
69085,"I have found it really hard to put on magnetic lashes that have 2 magnetic bars per lash. They are difficult to line up both at the same time, and they aren't as long as a realistic lash line. I ended up cutting each lash pairing in half so they are smaller chunks with one magnetic bar per lash set. This is much easier and looks better.",2
56610,"Was amazing for the first 2 weeks, and then my armpits became so irritated that I had to quit using!",2

138794,"These are plain pitted prunes, on the small side and a little dry, with excellent flavor. You may need more of them than usual to create a laxative effect. But they are easy to eat straight from the package and absolutely fine with oatmeal or yogurt in the morning. I ordered them when my local grocery was out of prunes for some reason and was glad to be able to get these from Amazon.",4
123495,"Writes smoothly and cleanly. Does not dry up and clog between uses. I use it for drawing. I have the extra fine and just ordered the medium. It arrived with the barrel snapped in three pieces. It was shipped in a flexible bubble envelope which probably got bent during shipping. This item is not returnable, but when I contacted Amazon, I did receive a refund. So I am going to order it again and hope it arrives undamaged.",4
126838,Good screen for the money - looks good. Just hate that it uses most of the GPIO pins which keep them from being used for other things. Otherwise pretty nice.,4
121244,"Tree is beautiful and lights are the perfect brightness. Sadly, the first windy day the tree broke off of the base. Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base. I solved the problem by creating a new base using 18"" long 1/2"" black iron pipe to push inside the tree's metal tube, then attached that to a 1/2"" black iron pipe flange. This flange was then welded to 4 legs of 2"" angle iron, each 15"" long. The base is then held down with 2 sandbags.",4

122529,"I was stunned by this book held my interest throughout. The relationship between the two lead female characters was an unexpected, but welcome development. Although I received the book from instant freebies, I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.",4
147696,best buy is at Costco or Smith&Final,4
129028,I found it easy to set up but it is a little tricky getting it to lock in place so you can use it. I haven't placed it in the dishwasher so I can't say that it's dishwasher safe. It easier to use a bottle brush and clean it with soap and water. I love having two bottles. Great for the price.,4
