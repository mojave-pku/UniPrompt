Although, there is a lot I like about these bottles, there are some things I am disappointed by. Positives -attractive design and color - look expensive even though they are great value -secure cap -great size, can fit an ice cube easily through top opening Negatives - they do not keep liquids hot or cold for as long as claimed in the description (5-6 hours max) - not very durable, one bottle dropped on to a tile floor from 5 feet and dented - they tend to fall out of the side mesh water bottle pocket of my backpack (this could be due to the size of the 25 oz bottles)",3

The elastic stylus-holder is small and the elastic does not have enough stretch/give, making it frustratingly difficult to insert a stylus.

105637,"I kinda knew when I got this book that it was going to be a sweet romance, which honestly, is rarely my cup of tea. That being said this book did have a couple of things going for it: military hero, family dynamics, and a whole host of animals (I super love animals in books). So Dani is our heroine and she is beyond likable. She runs a rehab facility for injured vets, and it’s both massive and top of line. She works her bum off to take care of the people who come to her for help, she lives and breathes this job. She’s both kind and caring but also patient. A lot of the people who come to her have a lot of anger to work through but she’s great with everyone. She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn’t anything I didn’t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that’s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don’t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets. It was a quick read for me, but definitely not a reread.",3

Additional details: the pigtails are not nearly as full as in the image. The color of the hair is far more saturated. The wig hairs are thin and silky, making them stick up often during brushing. I don't recommend purchasing this wig if you plan to style it in any way. It's a wig, it's what I have so I have to make do, but it's altogether a hassle to wear. The odd wig cap means lots of readjusting.",3

For medium chewing dogs like mine even with me trying to turn it into a great game he has no interest. I don’t know if it’s the rubber smell as he will play with his Kong’s just fine.,3

I really liked how the castle looked with the small cave and the dementions were perfect for what I needed (about the size of a soda can). After reading some of the negetive reviews before ordering I decided when I received the castle I would soak it in water for a few days to see what would happen. Guys it’s been soaking in a clean cup for 4 days and already there is a chemical smell coming from the water. I don’t doubt the resin used to mold this is safe. However, this paint they are using on the castle is definitely dissolving into the water. Not only that I don’t think the paint is eco safe either, it smells....wrong. I think I’m going to continue soaking this for up to a week alternating between sanitizer and clean water. After that I might coat the castle with some acrylic gloss protective spray paint a few times to hopefully seal it off before placing it in my tank. Besides the failure with the paint I love how this thing looks. If you do buy be aware you will have to do something about the paint, you don’t want this junk in your tank with your pets.",3

A very good value (price was affordable), easy installation (a have a Toyota FJ Cruiser) and great customer support. I recommend Lasfit over the plethora of competitors!

I have white LED headlights and I thought that the yellow would contrast and fill in side areas not covered by the headlights. All I see are yellow highlights to each side of the headlight beam. Switch them off and there is barely a difference. To be fair I didn't have opportunity to try these in fog. I'm not sure how you rate longevity but these will probably last forever!

It did, but the connector has to jiggled to get the sound to go to both speakers. I moved it to the other computer and the jacks still had to be wiggled around to get them to work.

Sure, it comes with lots of little gadgets but they are for pretend only - none of them are sturdy enough for actual usage outside.

44129,Bought this to decorate cookies. Without a lot of weight on it the thing just slides on the table instead of spinning. Very hard to turn. We have been spinning it quite a bit and think we see it loosening up a little. We are also having to order some double sided suction cups to see if we can get it to stay in place. Of course that is going to double the costs but we are hoping it will work.,2

I think the 2.4g channel is only using one of the 3 antenna. logging into the device is a horror with netgear making you register online and every single login it wants you to upgrade to a pay service and they almost force you into it.

This was sharp and would cause the child's hair to become tangled in it making it difficult to take on and off. Running my finger over it and it was actually sharp. I reported this to Amazon and they gladly shipped another,. The 2nd one was worse than the first. One side wasn't 'finished' properly …. appeared the silver color was worn or about to flake. It was rough when I ran my finger over it. AND--- the same sharp little protrusion at the bottom which I know will get caught in the hair. I know these are inexpensive little tiaras, but I want the child to enjoy it …. without it getting caught in her hair. . I am going to order a different style., Maybe I will have better luck.",2

It has fewer pockets and doesn't have a lined holder for your cell phone. I guess if you had never seen the older version you might like this but I would look elsewhere for something more utilitarian and better quality. I'm now using the bladder from this pack in my old pack since this one does not meet my needs for riding,2

The book consists of 40 exercises (hands) for the reader/student to work through, defining hand ranges for actions and one's own strategy. The problem is that there are no answers provided. Of course there is no single answer for any of the problems, but a baseline set of answers, for comparison if nothing else, is really needed here, imho.

I was told if the other balls arrived I could keep them and be refunded the money for my inconvenience. I have not been refunded my money.

69732,"The speakers I purchased for my system are somewhat cool sounding in the mids so I bought this pre-amp to warm them up and give them a more full sound. Taking this little guy out of the box it felt very well built and sturdy considering how small it was. I LOVE the feel of turning the nobs, it gives you a very satisfying click click click as you adjust them. The sound quality out of this didn't significantly change the sound but it's possible I needed to let this thing burn in a little. The treble and bass adjustments worked well and provided a noticeable difference in sound from min to max. Sitting next to my class D amplifier with the cool blue lights on and the gold finish on the nobs looked very cool. Unfortunately when I plugged these in line between my source and my amp and powered it on it gave the speakers a large pulse which made sort of a BOOM sound. When I turned the preamp on and off I kept getting the boom sound which made me feel like it could be sending too large of a signal into my speakers, potentially damaging them. Since I spent good money for high quality speakers I didn't want to run the risk of damaging them with a cheap little pre-amp so I will not be using it anymore.",2

After spending countless hours reading through hundreds of reviews and scouring Amazon and the net for good quality and high lumens bulbS, I decide on these. As LED’s are not inexpensive when first replacing, and you only experience money savings with usage down the road, I was disappointed to find 1 of the bulbs did not work immediately out of package. Would have given 5 stars, if this were not the case, as they are bright and efficient, and to find LED’s in this shape with this many lumens is difficult. Disappointing.",2

I tried taping it back together but iit can’t be really taped back, because then it bends when wrapped around the finger. I can’t comment on the effectiveness of the belt but the wrapping? A product so small, flat and light should be seen in a bag that’s transparent - so mistakes like this could be avoided.",2

71049,"ModMic is decent quality, but my main annoyance that I was hoping wouldn't be a big deal was the two cords and the magnetic attachment. The magnet connection is weak, and the mic gets knocked loose constantly. I'm also a bit let down there is almost no actual movement for the mic in terms of the length of it, its hard to get it positioned in the right spot angled towards your mouth while also being comfortably out of your vision and out of mind. Any sort of adjusting, of course, knocks it out of the magnet connection and leaves it frustrating.

THE BAD: Super thin stainless steel - I have yet to drop or bang against counter accidentally, but if/when that happens, it’s gonna dent easily. THE UGLY: Rubber gasket is already falling off regularly. Gonna add a drop of clear silicone to hold in place. The latch is crap. It’s hard to get the “hook” to align on the cruddy “catch” part & feels like it’s gonna break off in my hand every day. Just cheap-o. Caveat emptor!",2

On one of the harnesses I ordered, the buckle part snapped off with a little bit of rough play. As for the other harness, I put my dog on the leash and he started to run just a little, but when the leash tugged on the metal ring it was attached to, the fabric holding that piece just ripped apart and detached from the harness. Overall a good looking product and I still like how easy it is to put on my dogs, but probably not the best choice for dogs that are just a little rambunctious as it probably won't last.",2

Black and white photography and acting are very good. It's a low budget production and the story takes place inside a house. There are almost no exterior shots, if any. Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film.

149100,"Beautiful dress! I'm 5'7 and 140 pounds. I ordered a small for a tighter fit, but it was still a little loose.",4
124219,"I would have given this skirt 5 stars but both pockets had holes in them. Otherwise, nice fit (I am a size 10-12, ordered a Large) and great length.",4
141499,Enjoyed the detectives. Plot less compelling. Ready for 2nd of the series,4
121687,I now own these in 4 different colors. I gave it 4 stars because on one of the shirts the stitching was a little loose but over all a good buy. They are long enough to wear with leggings and cover your back end. The colors are just like pics.,4
130065,"They are a bit loose. The toe kept slipping off when she kicked around, so I'll have to make some alterations. Other than that, very nice colors.",4
149337,"Much larger than I expected, and well-constructed. The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles. It really helps with our portable mini washer which requires constant draining, spinning and refilling to wash and rinse clothes. It's easy to forget which stage the laundry is at, and the indicator saves us guessing.",4
126483,"Seems like it will last a while, as long as it is used for the purpose to which it was designed.",4
156911,Helped play in the steering wheel slightly. Adjusting the gears on the gear box worked much better to reduce play. Also bad wheel bearings can cause excessive play in the steering wheel. I broke off a bolt inside the frame where the sway bar attached and had to weld a rivet nut to the frame. Just be aware when installing.,4
156754,The fitting was not comfortable and the mask was heavy.,4
124893,"Stronger than I thought so I have adapted the dosage for my needs. You will have to test it for yourself. To much puts me to sleep. I use it a lot at bedtime. Directions say to turn the top one way to open, but my bottle opens the other way. It took me 4 days trying to open the bottle until I tried the other way. I will probably purchase again.",4
140045,Very good sturdy thick soft towels.,4

130882,It works really well. Its sturdy so it can take punishment but its hard to clean up the mess but all around a great product.,4
123540,It is soothing and may help retard the onset of cataracts. If that could be proven I would give it ten stars.,4
142849,I like how it helps stand-up. I don't like how to put them on. They don't really help with the knee problem i have. I've only worn them once and look forward to wearing them under and on top of my pants. It's just a little hot now.,4
144859,"Pros : cost, obviously. This is a cheap item but it still works as it’s supposed to. Cons : only one temp setting, hot. So you will need high heat oil / spray etc or it will burn your grease for the waffle and it will taste nasty.",4
125447,"Work well! They are a little slimmer/flimsier than ones I’ve used in the past, but that did make them easy to slide not only on the key but also on the key ring. The colors are definitely a bit more neon than I would have thought, but that’s fine! They do their job of easily distinguishing my keys.",4
151925,"I’ve had a few sets of bunk beds for my twins. By far this one has been their favorite. It’s very compact and leaves a lot more room in their room. I got the Black and it’s in great shape. I will say this took my husband a few hours to put together. Lots of parts!! The ladder going up was my only issue. The metal hurts my daughter’s feet climbing up/down. I tried a few different things to make it better and then I found my saving grace. A mega pool noodle!! Not just an ordinary one, mega. I cut one precisely and was able to get it perfect! Now she can climb up and down with out it hurting her feet!",4

142485,"it's still in wraps, but looks like a quality toy from the looks of things.",4
121056,"The older design was better, it provided more coverage of the screen as a whole. The new design leaves the glass above and in between the front facing camera and speaker exposed. This was my go-to screen protector, but I may need to find another.",4
142739,Smells great! You don't need to use very much and it's good as a setting spray.,4
141290,Girlfriend completely Loved it! Makes her Macbook look amazing!!,4
136465,While wider than I expected they will be perfect for a short cruise and pattern quite fun.,4
124645,I haven't used yet. I bought this for an up coming trip to the Dominican. It appears to be built very well but I have not used yet.,4
138696,"Comfy like what I expect from Crocs shoes--can easily wear for 4-6 hours. But as they day goes on & my feet expand, the strap closest to the front of the shoe starts digging into my pinky toes. Nice neutral color--was not gold bling bling sparkle so it matches well with my summer dresses, cargo pants & jeans. Easy to clean/rinse since I wore them on the beach. I have ankle issues so all of the straps & backing on this shoe provided some support to where my ankle didn't swell to much at the end of the day.",4
125731,"I liked this kit a lot, I gave it to my daughter who babysits, and everyone joined in to paint rocks.",4
150366,This game is fun and not crazy difficult but not super easy either!,4
145438,The only problem I have with it is that the stand-up mechanism isn't that stable and we can't adjust the angle.,4
135104,"The costume is great! I'm very pleased with what I got. Being an adult M i wasn't sure if i was going to need the next size up in order for it to fit. Thankfully it fit perfectly. Unfortunately the zipper gets stuck so bad. Last night I need help to get the zipper up, today no one can get the zipper up. It's not a size issue it's just the zipper. Ruins the look if the zipper doesn't zip!",4
125927,I was a little disappointed in the quality of these. The magnets work well and the size fits with the other name brand ones I have but the plastic is definitely thinner than the name brand ones. Overall good buy for the price!,4
147867,Loved the result but hair see dry,4
129943,"IT IS FINE, NO OTHER COMMENT TO MAKE AS IT WAS SIMPLY A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE I SMASHED AT MY DAUGHTER'S HOME.",4
137942,"We've had this thing for a long while now. I have pulled off evidence of a many drunk drivers. Once or twice I pulled to show off some other dumb move someone did. However, today, when someone tried their hardest to kill my daughter and I while we were driving back from school, I go to get the footage, despite their being a huge sudden stop that should have triggered the emergency recording, let alone the constant recording it should have been doing, and yet, not a single frame of it was recorded. I have nothing to hand the police about the [censored] person who showed know consideration for the safety of other drivers and came within inches of T boning our car. I gotta say, I've been a pretty staunch Anker fan for years, but this is supremely disappointing. I even mentioned after getting it, ""You know, if this thing fails, we're not going to know until we absolutely need it"" and I was absolutely right, I just didn't expect that time to come before only having it for maybe a year. EDIT: Anker customer support reached out to me after I posted this review. They were very kind and understanding of my situation. They got me squared away with a solution. I am updating the review with a better star rating, because they did such a great job with customer satisfaction. Their products are extremely reliable, and outside of rare situations like I was presented with, they are definitely the brand to buy.",4
147283,Some of the reviews mention the kennel only comes with plastic nuts and bolts. The nuts are plastic but the bolts are metallic. The nuts molding quality is not great so the bolt's thread does not engage properly in some of them and they cannot be tightened. They supply about 5 spare nuts and bolts so you eventually find enough pairs that work together to assemble the kennel. It is easy to assemble but I only give it 3 stars because at this price you'd expect higher quality fasteners that work right first time.,4
137331,Fits more than I expected given the size of the opening. Seems to be good quality and comfortable to wear.,4
127891,"I bought this product for when I’m on vacation and away from home. With it being small it is very discreet and easy to tuck away. The one thing I was not 100% satisfied with was the app. It works decently but I feel it could be more user friendly/easier to use. Every once in a while I struggle to check it while away from home because it isn’t saved as yours. It is easiest accessed when on the same WiFi network, otherwise you have to put in much information to find your camera. Overall it is a really nice thing to have in my home because it gives me peace of mind.",4
121763,It is perfect. Shipping was on time. No issues with it at all.,4
133217,This top is so beautiful but the fit is way too small. I'm a size 4-6 and the L I ordered fits like a small. I was going to return it but it's too pretty lol.,4

120914,Great price. Screw holes slightly off but unnoticeable once it's on. It did come scratched so that may bother you. I figured it'll get scratched when playing anyway lol. Again you can't beat the price.,4
143417,Being my first product like this I didn’t know what to expect. All in all it’s a decent toy.,4
135951,"I do not like them for the shoes I bought them to go with, but the are perfect for dress shoes.",4

135254,Great standard tape dispenser. I do wish it would come with an extra plastic core just in case one gets lost.,4
129492,"Compact, robust stainless steel shell and easy to manipulate shape. Performance is as rated. Quickly transfers using USB 3.0 interfaces. I use it as a boot drive for pfSense. Unfortunately, the flash drive runs very warm, hot actually. Uncomfortable to hold! This gives concern to its reliability in the long term. Be sure to have adequate ventilation. If used as an internal USB boot drive, it's recommended to have it in some form of air flow pathway within the chassis.",4
147230,"There seems to be a short where the cord goes in to the light. If the light doesn't come on, push the cord into the socket and wiggle it up and down to get the light to come on. Even so will order another one for the living room.",4
142836,"Great little square/marking tool. I wish it was just a 1/2"" loner. I find I would use it more often if it fell in the 3.5"" range instead of stopping at 3"". Still a handy tool though.",4
148027,Must make sure using the right charger thought was issue with battery until I switched chargers and has worked good since,4
143494,I liked it i used it on a combi lift at work.,4
122637,"For the price it’s a nice Duvet cover. I had hoped it would be a little softer but perhaps with more washings it will be. Also, I’m using it on a split king and it could be a little wider",4

134833,Nice looking bird house,4
131144,"Love these flip flops!, The little ""bumpers"" take some getting use to but once you do, it's a great feeling of a massage while walking. Great for fatigued feet and legs. They're also very cute with the earth sole! I would suggest sizing up because they are narrow.",4
120624,Product as described.,4
155172,"Ordered size 14 for this shoe, overall the fit and quality seemed good, however, as I walked around the house to try them out, I realized the rubber that wraps around the toe ended up pressing into my big toenail. And they are a tight size 14, and I knew when your feet swell a bit with hiking they would not be comfortable. So I reluctantly returned them Sadly, they don't carry a size 15, and there are no free returns for the size 14, I am out $12.95 for return shipping with nothing to show for it and hope I get a refund soon... :(",4
135115,"I am 5' 10 and 165 pounds and purchased a medium. VEry nice product. Nice to have the full back covered so you do not see the bra fat rolls. I have this one in nude and got another in black. It makes you very shapely. The only draw back is the straps right at the arm pit cut in a bit so it is not great for wearing more than five hours. it is not a design flaw, it is jut the way it needs to be fitting to give you that slim look. Worth a try for sure and if you want to walk around in a fitted dress and get rid of ALL your rolls this is the product for you.",4
123698,"Most of the games in this book I do not understand but boy do I love playing Trucks! I wasn’t really sure what I thought about trucks as a subject matter before but now I am pretty on board. I wouldn’t go as far to say I am now a truck enthusiast but I do now look at trucks in my everyday life through a new lens — one that appreciates trucks more. I would not recommend playing Trucks (and other games) at the workplace! I was let go because I kept playing Trucks. Though I'm not too worried about making rent this month because I’ve saved up quite a bit of cash this winter and I recently sold my set of banana slicers which brought in a chunk of change. But if you want to help, I am still selling a few other items which you can check out on my Etsy page (mostly wicker items). I did try to use the pages of the book to press and preserve some small leaves, clover petals, local dirt samples, etc but the book does not weigh enough to do the job well. Though, because this isn’t the book’s primary function I’ve only deducted one star from my review.",4

133830,"LOTS OF BASS. Do not buy these if you're looking for a naturally flat EQ, but if you are a bass head, these are perfect. The actual quality of sound is awesome for this price point. The lows are punchy but not crunchy. Drums feel much more dynamic and alive in most of the music I've tried. The highs are not pushed forward in the mix, but they have a pleasant sound and clarity.",4

156082,Do wish it was thicker.,4
150707,"It's shorter and wider than others in a good way. Not obnoxious and doesn't bounce around the water bottle openings on machines. 2 small improvements would make it perfect - the lock should be off center and open diagonally. It sticks up a bit and you will hit your chin if running while drinking (see photo), and the strap is material and doesn't come off, so it will be wet after rinsing or washing. Also great perk that it comes with extra seal. I wanted a new bottle because a lot of them have silicone seals you can't remove and they get mildew underneath with no way to get it clean. This bottle has a simple band and plug system so easy to clean.",4

127205,"I dry brush my body and have had amazing results. I figured it would do the same for my face. I wet the brush as suggested for my first use and I did not like that. It was way too soft. Now I only use it dry. I started off and actually continue to dry brush every other day. The first few times my face turned burning red a few hours after the dry brush. This lasted for maybe 2 days. It felt like I had applied retinol to my entire face or got a sunburn. I kept going. I got a few pimples. I kept going. My pimples have healed and now my skin is dry and peeling in some places. Exact same reaction as I had to retinol. (Prescription retinol cream). I started to use argon oil on the peeling skin and that has helped. My skin is so soft and when the peeling settles down and it will my skin will be new and lovely. I no longer get red from the dry brushing and I am not getting pimples. It’s probably been two weeks of use. I don’t see much of a difference in my pores, (I have a magnifying mirror). My face feels tighter yet softer. My goal was to nix some of the slack in my skin and maybe help loosen up some wrinkles. I see improvement in my laugh lines but not forehead wrinkles. Pretty sure the skin is now leather on my forehead so that may take some time. Also gently working on eye wrinkles. The goal is to just get some blood circulation to that area. As a result my under eye area has seen less fluid accumulation ie bags. I love the idea and this brush is working well for me. It’s the only Facial brush I have tried so I have no comparison. I think the stiffness of the brush dry is perfect. Wet it was too soft for my 45 year old weathered skin.",4

His recommended dosage was 5 tablets. There was no way I was going to give him 5 tablets to start with. I gave him 2 tablets on the first day and the second day gave him 3. On the 3rd day he started to vomit bile and it was uncontrollable. He is healthy as can be. He is 1.5 years old and we took him to our vet and they suggested that we stop giving him these tablets as it was the only new thing introduced to his diet. He lost his appetite the 4th day but continued to drink water. Sure enough the next day he was back to normal after stopping these tablets for two days. Stay away!,1

This product worked great for the first 3 weeks but even after routine maintenance and cleaning I don’t believe this product is worth your money. This product does assist in cooling a smaller space when ran on cool and packed with ice or the cooler packs provided! You do have to replace either option fairly quickly to keep the temperature cool. However I completed the 2 week recommended care but by “clean out” they really mean that you have to basically take apart the entire product (10+ screws) to get a thorough cleaning in. I’ve had this product for about 3 months and even with the completion of the routine care, it still stopped working! Unlike many amazon products- the return or exchange policy is very short- 1 month. 1 month of owning the product is not enough time to fully allow the cooler to run and determine the quality of it! I recommend not purchasing this product and spending a few more bucks on a quality brand!! Very disappointed for the amount of money I spent!",1
35966,"Battery had charging problems from day 1. At first wouldn't fully charge and later phone would die very quickly. Finally removed battery and put original 2 year old battery back in, much better than ""new"" replacement. Battery is garbage. I charged it before using battery with original Samsung charger. I tried several different chargers.",1
14279,"Everyone else is saying it’s easy. Maybe it’s because I’m a beginner considering I’ve put together only two things. Or maybe I just got the trashy product considering the white is already turning black from scraping against the metal. I could not do the final step for the life of me - it says that you need to lay the back down onto the seat and twist in the bolts, which I did - THEN lift it up and twist in different bolts. I understood those directions very clearly. However, you have to FORCE the bolts to go into place. It took me 10 minutes to do all the steps, but it took me at least 45 minutes to do the last one. And I still didn’t even do it correctly. The back of the chair is too far in, and I really cannot lean back. I wish I could return this chair. I regret spending $100",1
101,"I bought a package of three. Two of them have already stopped working and it's only been about six months. The use has been minimal. We each used one on our nightstand, and I kept an extra one in the office. We never traveled with them, never took them out of the house, and they just stopped working for no apparent reason.",1

The pads were not even the ones that were pictured on the package insert.

Of course, for this little money you can't expect any better, so don't waste your money and look somewhere else. One star just to publish the review, but doesn't deserve even that.",1

28883,I didn't even know this was a horror-comedy until after I wasted my life watching list lame film and then read the reviews. I didn't laugh once during the entire movie. This movie is beyond stupid and an insult to the horror genre.,1

3299,I thought this would help me give my husband back rubs but it hurts my hands more and I can’t feel how much pressure I’m using while trying to rubs the knots out of his back. Maybe if I bought it to use on myself I’d feel better about this but for using on someone else it was a wasted purchase. Hurts my wrists to use it.,1
30433,Poor quality!!! All of the “Heavy Duty Clear Vertical ID Card Badge Holder” came broken right out of the box.,1
36737,Advertised as two bottles but only received one. Have contacted customer service twice but have not received missing bottle.,1
18886,I ordered the L/XL size and it's still way too small. Had to give it to a sparring partner. The chin piece would not reach me chin and it barely fit around my head. Definitely not an XL.,1
39514,The camera is already broken and my daughter used it twice. The button on top stopped working so it no longer takes pictures. I’d love a replacement because I can tell the product was pre-used. There was already another families pictures on it and I don’t mean professional demo pictures. The pictures were kid quality and blurred.,1

25518,"So, as all the 1 star reviews say, the screws do not fit. It's true, they really don't. It stinks, however, it's not hard to fix. I used a larger drill bit to bore out the holes a bit more, and it fit together after. This is a huge nuisance as I am sure most regular people aren't as skilled with a drill as I may be. Nor should you have to be when buying a toy like this for a kid. Once you do fix this, the hoop is actually pretty nice. Just know, the screws will 100% not fit when you buy it. You will need to do extra work.",1

20218,"This review is only for the NEW design of ""waterproof"" speaker for this listing. The first option looks sturdy but they offered a newer option that was a couple $ cheaper so I figured why not. It is the cheapest little speaker ever. Definitely not waterproof. Sound quality is eh, plus the ""volume"" button and ""skip"" button are the same so if you are trying to turn up a song you really like, you're most likely going to skip it. It worked for what I needed it for but definitely does not match the description of the original style listed.",1

3448,"First, the info in this book is more about how to study, where to study, facts about study habits, etc. There is not nearly as much substance on the actual exam. In addition, there are typos, and the writing is in English - reflecting that English is not likely the first language of the writer, which is fine, but that's what editors are for! Also, there is no PDF as promised in the description, although I have noticed now that they have changed the description, so I'm guessing there were other complains. I should have paid more attention to the other reviews.",1

12855,"I was using these to remove grout and the metal connection at the tool broke on one side. I assumed it was an fluke or an error on my part so I adjusted the blade attachment to the tool to connect to the unbroken part of the blade. While doing so, I noticed that the abrasive was failing but there was enough left to keep going. This time it broke within 20 seconds. I was going slowly to avoid putting stress on the blade, letting the tool do the work and not forcing it. Here is the second blade that failed by breaking at the connection. The first I threw away assuming it was my error. But when it happened again, I realized that I had wasted my money on this product. Please don't make the same mistake.",1
13040,Beware never received item from seller!!!!,1
17024,I just got it and it's broke,1
13324,so far the bits I have tried were pretty solid sturdy Little Things but the tool itself I'm very disappointed with. the bent that you can see in the pictures happens the second time I used it when it barely tapped the edge of a finish nail and it through the heavy duty grinding wheel off and it just about went through my safety glasses. Also the first time I use it immediately it was almost impossible to tighten the part down that holds the collet in. also the flex hose I'm assuming must have been very poorly made because it basically fell apart the first time I used it. I'm very disappointed and I wish that I had waited and saved the money to buy a wen rotary tool or Dremel because I feel very ripped off. Will not be buying this product again ever.,1

168695,"This is a really good option for a physical sunscreen because it has high, broad spectrum protection, and the white cast is not awful. In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen. I have sensitive skin, but I've had no negative reaction to the product whatsoever! I'm very satisfied with this purchase and look forward to repurchasing it in the future.",5

Thank you so much for your beautiful, quick, affordable work!",5

168380,"When we first plugged it in once we received, we saw that the spiders were still around and that the device wasnt working. Now that the repellent has been plugged in for within 2 weeks i’ve seen no mice or spiders. I realised that on the product description that it states that the pest may increase at the beginning while the ultrasonic waves start to kick in. Since I plugged these in I’ve seen none! Absolutely none, I can’t believe it. I am very happy with this product which has prevented bugs from invading my home. I have small children so the bonus is, it is chemical free, just plug in and it goes to work! I highly recommend.They really work! I would definitely buy more but just give it a few weeks to see the difference. Great repellent!!",5
162956,works great. love this product!,5
166171,Well worth every penny.,5
166031,"The bag was delivered on time. I didn't know what to expect, but I'll say I was pleasantly surprised. The material is a little thin for my liking, but so far, it appears and seems to be very sturdy. I'm a truck driver, so I spend Sunday night through Friday morning on the road. It's large enough that I can take 6 outfits, underwear and socks. I can also use the pouch on the inside for my toiletries. The shoulder strap isn't very comfortable, but it'll do. I would recommend.",5
166582,Working well on my arthritic left knee !,5
174222,Works great on my electric guitars. Bought the Chrome one also as it seems to work better on my acoustic guitars. These are the best capos made as you adjust the tension perfect for your guitar.,5
196258,"This is one of those stories that could have taken a page out of every action movie ever and just focused on the car chases and shootouts at the expense of having actual, relatable characters. This story doesn't lack for action, but I ended up actually liking some of the characters by the end of it. The protagonist comes off as kind of the opposite of Indiana Jones, but by the end of it, I kind of took a ""wait and see"" attitude on whether he's really so incapable of being a hero. As others have mentioned, the character development seemed to not be as deep as it could be, but maybe the author was assuming that readers of this book had already read the first book. I'm kind of looking forward to the next book.",5
164273,This works well if you need the extra usb ports for a computer. I didn't have any problems with it at all. I plugged it in and it worked. We use this in a couple places through out the house so guests can plug in their devices for charging. Guests that are concerned about conserving energy like the fact they can turn off individual ports when not in use.,5
184489,"Good price, does it's job",5

164942,My boy loved the cake props! He now uses them as toys. Couldn’t be happier with this purchase!,5
167317,I have a small wrist and love styles like this where all the excess strap is tucked away. This is as comfortable as a sport band but the leather classes things up. I want it in more colors.,5
163226,"Extremely affordable, clear plastic, no silly colors or patterns, rubbery feel (the g7 is impossibly slippery), compact, comes with clear screen protector (haven't used that yet). Just what I needed for a very low price.",5
193632,Very nice charger!!! Charges really fast,5
175242,These are my favorite,5
164046,Worked as advertised. Not much else to comment on.,5
179165,The air filter cleaning set works great. The cleaning spray would be better with a hand trigger instead of the thumb mechanism. The aerosol Spray is easy to use and goes on evenly. Will definetely buy more.,5
190605,One of favorite new Christmas pieces. This wall art is cute!! Would buy again,5
184723,they work great I had these before,5

164589,Thin enough to wear your round. Flows behind you when you walk.,5
193531,"These are the best product I've tried for keeping glasses from slipping down the nose on hot, humid outside days. I found them to be very comfortable too.",5
178733,Perfect and good price,5
196321,I wasn't sure about reading a paranormal suspense but I'm glad I read this. Awesome read. Curious but sad in many ways. Looking forward to the next book in the imprint series.,5
