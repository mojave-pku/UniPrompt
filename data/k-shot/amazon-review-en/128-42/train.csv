84660,"I‚Äôm giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn‚Äôt realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn‚Äôt. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don‚Äôt know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.",3

I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus.

The gate is purposely agape to adjust to the tightening of the tension screws. You tighten up until the door meets the latch. Right now, I have it fit sort of kitty-corner between the two walls which is not ideal as I can't keep it at the proper tension.

100033,"I have a turtle beach headset for my xbox one, so it was a no brainer to get one for my recently purchased PS4. However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else.

41259,I can't say that this product is worth the price. They do not last long and this was my second set. The first ones I purchase broke almost immediately ..at least in time to be able to replace them. Now shortly after receiving the second set they too have broken. But when I checked to get them replaced the return date has passed. I am not happy with this item at all. On the up side my Grandsons LOVED them while they were working. Too bad they broke so quickly,2

70579,"This fascinator looked cute when I did not move, but it was too heavy to stay in place. I used the clip on the headband, but the whole thing kept falling forward on my forehead. At the Derby party, I tried taking it off the headband and just clipping it to my hair, but it still was too heavy to stay in place and kept sliding down. It was uncomfortable, and I finally just had to take it off so it did not fall down into my mint julep. :)",2

56899,"The top was a bit tight and I'm a 36 B. I got a medium. I prob would still wear top but underboob is inevitable since the straps are not adjustable. Otherwise the top was cute.

46601,"I‚Äôm disappointed. Toilet is fully functional and reasonably priced,.... but... the casting is out of level, both the base and tank. The problem was obvious once the tank was installed, since the tile behind the toilet was level and called attention to the issue. The fix was to install galvanized shims under the bowl and between the tank and bowl. Not a perfect answer, but the problem was less noticeable. I would have been better off paying $20 more for a different toilet, manufactured with better quality control.",2

78562,It looks easier than it is. I ran around trying to fill this thing with air and it took several tries. I looked ridiculous. Finally got enough air in it to make it work. I sat on it then fell right off. I really think I am missing something. My 12-year old had trouble staying on it as well. We left it next to the tent that night and must have gotten rain because in the morning the thing had water in it...actually inside the liner.

Dead who are alive - difficult concept, we can‚Äôt be even sure who is in and out, for the whole series a threat, as there might be the case, that those killed in the first volume will be back in the third.

The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.",4

Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base. I solved the problem by creating a new base using 18"" long 1/2"" black iron pipe to push inside the tree's metal tube, then attached that to a 1/2"" black iron pipe flange. This flange was then welded to 4 legs of 2"" angle iron, each 15"" long. The base is then held down with 2 sandbags.",4

155058,"Pretty easy to assemble. The quality is decent I just wish it was taller to watch movie while sitting in chairs. The screen is pretty short. Originally I put it up for movie and it fell back cause of strong winds, good thing it came with stakes and rope to stake it down for stability.",4
155395,Great info from a history buff,4
149807,"This is a great purchase for the price. Works great, speed is great and i appreciate that it comes with the extra blade replacement pieces. My only complaint is that it does not come with a plug for the USB cord, thought that was odd. But considering the savings, compared to $15 for most electric sharpeners and the fact that most items we have use USB cords, we are fully stocked. That was the only reason for 4 out of 5 stars",4
157289,"I was skeptical about ordering this, but thought anything had to be better than what we had. We got it out of the box and into the camper. We have not slept on it yet. But we have laid on it for couple minutes and so far I am super impressed. I am debating on replacing our bunk beds as well. Well worth the money. Only reason I‚Äôm rating it 4 stars is because we have not slept a night on it yet.",4

130936,We like that it‚Äôs insulated and we like that it‚Äôs unbreakable. It Is hard to press sometimes though. I don‚Äôt know if this is because the grind we are using is too fine? It is aesthetically pleasing. Overall we are very happy thank you.,4
140064,These were perfect size to go inside the ACE bandage I was wearing. The sleeve kept it from direct skin contact but allowed the cold through. These were somewhat difficult to activate but this prevented accidentally breaking the inner bubble.,4

141982,"Be careful when tightening the fittings, especially the fittings in the Tankless heater, ensure you use a wrench to hold the fitting there not to twist off or damage the copper fitting piping inside the heater. And use the right size wrench and not pliers or channel locks, because you can damage or round off the the edges of fittings. Phasing the fittings is easy to get the alignment you need.",4
137110,"Nice headphones for the price. I love the rich rose gold color that matches my iPhone and accessories. The sound is really good and everyone can hear me clear as well. The music clarity is good and has a nice volume level. The only thing is the distance of the headset to the phone is a little short for good reception. It even announces the caller by name or number. Overall, I like this product.",4
143244,The story is gripping and it really draws you in. My only complaint is the author seemed to bounce around a bit and didn‚Äôt explain who was whom very well.,4

157925,"Easy to assemble and sturdy, light enough to pick up and move, and the speakers sound great. However, this chair is far from comfortable. you sink into the chair for lack of cushion, and you can feel the front board in the chair on the back of your legs. Also, the curve at the lumbar portion of the chair arcs your back and causes pain after a short time. Recommend extra padding/lumbar support if you get this chair.",4

It's more of a bright orange flavor....Don't get me wrong...it's good, and a nice ""bright"" flavor over ""Mint""....but the description is a little misleading. (Wow....ask my 22 year old self if I would be reviewing LIFESAVERS later in life, and I would have finished my beer, then laughed at you!) I think these are good! Just not ""mints"" as they state....",4

141513,"Dock is solid, clean, cheap, and easy to install. However, after looking around I would consider buying a different shell that is compact enough to fit in a travel case (This one is slightly too thick to fit in mine), or a larger one with more features. For example, I would have liked to use the spring-loaded cradle and the power LED from the original dock. When I get a second dock I will be looking for a shell that includes these features. However, I have no problems with this one and I use it all the time on my TV. When I take the switch to someone else's house I put the ac adapter and the dock with the switch in a larger bag.",4
133433,I was disappointed that these were a jersey material with a wired bow design not bandana material. They are a little big for my head but they are cute and comfy.,4

145775,Fragile handle with care,4
125630,"Very pretty design. I was looking to replace my cloth placemats because I was honestly tired of washing them! These are VERY thin. I read other reviews that mentioned how thin they were but didn‚Äôt think it would bother me so I ordered them anyway. Well, I‚Äôm not sure I would have ordered them if someone had mentioned that they are paper thin. No joke they might be thinner than paper!

144645,"I bought the kitchen shears for preparing chicken for Asian dishes. We enjoy free range chicken on the bones so I needed to have shears that can cut through breast bones. These shears have comfortable handles and is very sharp. The shears can also be used to open bottles and can scale fish. I like the fact that the shears can come apart which makes it easy to clean them. The shears come with a magnetic sleeve to hang them on the fridge, but mine was warped so it did not stick on the fridge.",4
141273,Product was available very quickly. Very nice color. Thinner than I expected.,4
153723,"This tent is perfect for my wife and I. Set up is crazy easy and our tent was up in seconds compared to our friends who have traditional tents. It is spacious and left plenty of room even after our queen size mattress was in it. The only downside is that if you want any privacy you have to have the fly on because the whole top of the tent is mesh. If your not in some shade, with the fly on its get pretty warm pretty quick when the sun is shining since there aren‚Äôt really windows to unroll and let a breeze through. Usually you camp under some trees however so this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem too often. Overall we love this tent! The blue color is a plus too because it really stands out and looks beautiful!",4

136135,"The kids are great. I bought them with the stands to start sprouting with jars. They worked fine. Honestly though, I would have liked something simple like a cheap plastic jar tipper...but thought, at the time that more fancy was better. Not necessarily true. You dont need to be able to tip jars at unlimited angles...just far enough to get the water out without clogging the holes.",4
136303,I love the idea of these bags and I use them to keep food fresh in the freezer. My one complaint is that it can be hard to get them open and closed.,4
123350,So good for hanging tools on. Clip could be slightly tighter to prevent it lifting up when removing tools.,4
120678,the product is definitely versatile and good idea to keep around for any family accident. keeping ours.,4

127161,Great fitting earpiece that was really easy to mold. Would have been 5 starts if they had provided a second adaptor so you could have both a right and a left earpiece in at the same time. Price is a bit expensive for only one fully functional earpiece.,4

152118,"Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.",4
124030,Really nice looking in person. Keeps everything at temp.,4
121615,Not bad. Beans are better than grounds if you have the tool to grind it.,4
140133,This worked out really well for me. I was consistently getting 90 pumps or water out of the 5 ml size bottle. That is not a typo. Ninety.,4

130973,"Too big for my wrist! (I‚Äôm female, early 30s, 5.5‚Äù and average body complexity). And it is also too big for my mom‚Äôs wrist. I bought 2 of them: wine red one for me and black one for my mom. Too bad they don‚Äôt offer different sizes in this band. I was very disappointed at first because I love how slim these bands are! I was going to return them but then I decided to buy a tool to make holes instead and I did, spent only $7 on it and it worked perfect and we are both very pleased with our bands! We made 2 MORE holes on each band!!! (With the same distance between holes as original holes). These smart watches are meant to be kind of tight on your wrist, well not tight, but touching the skin all around, so it can feel the heartbeat, track your exercise, track your sleep at night, etc, so having them even a little loose is useless to me.",4

148864,I ordered this product a size larger than I normally wear and it was snug. 2 sizes larger would probably have fit perfectly. The fabric is soft and breathable. These are easily dressed up for work or to be made more casual.. very versatile,4
133785,Works great around your nails for clean up. If you use it as a base to keep your nails from being damaged it takes forever to dry.,4
152727,This works exactly as described. Make sure the seat is tightly secured before putting your child in it.,4
124068,O.K. for the price. Not so sturdy. Was broken in the first 2 days.,4

9447,"It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.",1

For Brazilian front and back, the front was ok I still had to go over with a razor and the back didn't really work I had to just shave. The hair grew back faster than usual Im guessing because I pretty much shaved (since the wax didn't remove the hairs). I have course curly hairs but Ive never had a wax not work. I've been waxing for a while and this has to be the worse wax. Ive paid less for waxes that work on all of my body parts leaving it smooth for weeks.

Maybe Kohler changed their design to make it deeper, or something, but this tool is next to USELESS for removing jets from my tub. Instead of the ball lip, all you can ""grab"" is the sloped ledge inside the ball, which with a LOT of persistence and side pressure might eventually get the insert to let go. We finally ""modified"" the tool by melting portions of the stop-ball away, making it more functional and much less pretty. Caveat Emptor.",1

Only after 1 month of light-use (2-3 hours a week), it started degrading. The grip of the strings started to loosen up and no matter how many times you tighten it up it always loosens immediately on playing and causing a weird tone while strumming. That is not how a good guitar should function!",1

23223,I pre ordered this book because I really like the first few books. This one however is a total let down. This is a fictional story and the trashy political jabs should have been left out. The story would be just fine without the author interjecting her personal political views. Start a blog if you want to rant about the Trump administration. Don't make your customers pay for it.

UPS did not follow up with their investigation of where package delivered; so I had to go hunting for it all over neighborhood. Love the USPS. UPS, I have had problems. Just an FYI.",5
