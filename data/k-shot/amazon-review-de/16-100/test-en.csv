1,"first of all, the anchor holder makes a solid impression. The magnetic holder is also usable. What is not possible is the fact that the holder for round ventilation nozzles, contrary to what is described by the manufacturer, is not suitable! The smartphone constantly falls down. Due to the frequent reassembly, the rubber coating is now also broken, which means that the ventilation nozzle is scratched nicely! So scrap that also damages my car! For me, this is not useful!",1

10,"Unfortunately, the delivery went completely wrong here. The goods arrived broken at my place. The return went via the amazon-Locker. The seller never got the goods back and I still had to pay. Very, very annoying!",1
11,"Unfortunately, the socks were too small, so I sent them back. Supposedly they didn't arrive, so I didn't get a credit either. Only outrageous and absolutely customer-unfriendly answers received.",1
12,"I stupidly assumed that if the description says ""with wooden frame"" this is also so. This would have justified the high price compared to the cheap copies that are also available on Amazon. Unfortunately, the whole watch is made of shabby plastic. Too bad and screw-up. Technology and function flawless, beautiful bird songs but just cheap plastic, like all the others.",1
13,I still look the same fat with this part. A real failure for the money,1

15,"Bought us these underwater lights for our pool. for each light there was a remote control, which I consider nonsensical.

17,There were black rubber crumbs in the glass jar. The glass tube has sharp burrs on both sides. Both ends have small jumps. The rubber stopper smells unpleasant.,1

When grinding Himalayan salt, for example, after some time of use, an abrasion of the black plastic from the mill can be found between the ground salt. It also smells accordingly of plastic abrasion.

25,"Like some others here, after almost a week the connection from hose to pistol is torn off and so the thing is for the garbage. In my opinion, such a garden hose has to withstand a little stress. My old garden hose lasted 10 years with exactly the same handling. However, it was also three times as expensive. Cheap is only an option if the processing is ok. That this hose does not last 10 years was clear to me, but not even a week just does not work.",1

44,The beautiful paper seal and the glass were still intact. But the lid was probably not screwed properly onto the glass and thus the whole package was full of honey. Don't feel like walking to the post office to return an empty jar of honey. Now have enough work to wash all other items that were in the package. :-(,1
45,"I ordered the case because it stands out nicely from the uniform porridge and has a modern design. Satisfied for three months and then the plastic breaks at the cavity for the on/off button.

46,"Because of my toddler, the braid was my daily companion and I was open to something new and then soon regretted. I never wore them firmly or strictly and yet my hair is broken off so that I have everywhere short hair where the hair rubber typically sits and the structure is visibly damaged with open hair, so it was not at all before and that although I put others much firmer. I had my hair cut off so as not to be so often dependent on a braid and to protect my hair. Also my hairdresser said I should throw them all away - said done. Now use the old ones again.",1

Absolutely overpriced for such poor quality!",1
54,Undergarment was far too short. Just covered the chest. Material so bad. Uncleanly sewn. Had holes. Seller does not want to send a replacement. Not recommended very unfriendly contact. Preferably minus stars,1

57,I can't recommend the product. One device was defective and the other works poorly. Small areas usually remain open or the foil is simply severed.,1
58,"Since I can not reach amazon, I have to write a corresponding review here. According to amazon's internal tracking, the item arrived at my place personally yesterday. However, I can't find it anywhere, neither in my mailbox nor in front of my apartment door. Presumably the package was delivered to a neighbor, but to which one? We live in an apartment building with 6 parties. There was no information, neither in writing nor by e-mail. Amazon should work urgently on this, because unfortunately it is not the first incident of this kind.",1
59,"On the second day of use, the adapter began to spin, I could only work to a limited extent via HDMI, as a constant flickering hindered the field of vision. Sound is quite unusual from time to time. Definitely not a purchase recommendation!!",1

68,"Complete screwing! Hands off! The app does not work and everything is in Chinese in the app! Thus, you simply have a slightly too large mobile phone case, which is mirrored on the front with plastic, without magnet and extremely unwieldy.

My current starry sky consists of white dots.During the day you can't see the stars and in the evening they shine beautifully white. This starry sky, however, has a green tint. I glued two dots to my existing starry sky as a test and what can I say. It doesn't meet my expectations at all. They glow green and stars are just not green and during the day you can see the green dots on the wall. If I hadn't used two of them now, they would have gone back. They will probably end up in the garbage.pity",1
75,the wrong thread was delivered... this one does not have 6mm as in the description. So off to the bin. Very annoying that!,1

Then he said I should order it again and he gives me 3 pieces on goodwill because of the long waiting time, it would not cost me any more money so I should buy it again / order it and now 9.99 € were deducted from my account again. And now he says it would be a good deal 2 pay a free. So I won't shop here in the future.",1
96,"Beautiful design. Unfortunately delivered defective, an exchange of the defective article has not yet taken place. There was also no money back.

101,"My conclusion after 6 years: hardly used and in the sixth year really dangerous! Unfortunately, the trampoline did not keep what one hopes for from a "" branded article "". For the first three years, I always completely dismantled it in winter and stored it dry. After the second year, rusty spots appeared on the frame and other places, although it is a galvanized frame and a product that is advertised as an outdoor item. The padding around the rods did not prove itself for long and after about 3 years the material was so brittle that it dissolved. After three years, I didn't break it down in winter. The jump mat with UV coating is completely cracked this year during the first use. The condition can be seen well in the pictures, durable and stable looks different. Not only that I now have a large expensive scrap heap in the garden, the shock when you bang through the net and the risk of injury that emanates from this qualitatively defective product... definitely not recommended...",1

But when I screwed on the handle, I had to push the whole front frame to the right. Thus, this is quite on tension. I had to adjust the treadmill as well described in the instructions. Since this setting, the edges of the treadmill curve upwards. It stays that way, even as I turned it back. I also find the treadmill very small.

Either you have the carpet glued to the vacuum cleaner or it sucks mediocre. Sometimes I have to lift fluff from the carpet and hold it in front of it. An annoying topic.. .. I bought another one now, from a company that does direct sales and has existed since the time of my grandmother.

However, there were several cuts and cracks in the net when opening, so I had to get the sewing kit out to mend the holes in the middle. So far it would have been 2 stars, but then came the most serious thing: Due to the fact that the net is quite rigid and inflexible, it can not be held by Velcro tapes, I do not even have the possibility to fix the patched net to the window.

Now to the function: Connects only after some gimmicks.... if you follow the instructions, it does not work at all, only after I have removed a battery from the base station and inserted it again, the transmitters have finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three channels was very different! All in all, for me so useless! The thing went back! Would advise against a purchase in any case, brings only trouble!",1

The given internal dimensions are not correct! It was much worse when we had to bear the shipping costs of over 20 euros ourselves when returning - ALTHOUGH ON THE PART OF VIDA DESIGNS WRONG DIMENSIONS ARE GIVEN. The blame, in my opinion, is not on our side at all, as we have measured everything thoroughly and accurately. To sit on the over 20 euros is really outrageous!",1

The clamps that connect the hoses to each other should be made of high-quality clamps and not plastic scrap. I would have liked to have paid a few euros more to save myself such a trouble. In addition, the push/ start button did not work and it was always an act to start the pump again after cleaning. This was only possible with 2 people.

341,I didn't expect much at the price but the quality is very poor so I sent it back and bought one from husqvarna,1
342,Should be delivered via DPD. Supposedly they were up to 3 x there but only once was a notification card in the BK without date and then the jacket was simply sent back and was then no longer available :(((((,1
343,"Would like to test the product, but it never arrived. Had ordered it in November and it should arrive in December. When this was not the case, I then contacted the seller, but he only wrote me that I should have followed (after more than a month). The product has not arrived even today, therefore 1 star",1
344,"So, I was very dissatisfied. Baking the waffles took an eternity. That's all I can say, although Amazon would like it.",1
345,"After only a few months of use, both sides of the carrying strap have loosened.... And the seller refused to repair or refund the bag... What a pity... but not again.",1
346,"It absolutely does not fulfill its stated purpose. This means that the whole part gets stuck in the shopping cart, it was intended for unlocking. so just a big annoying chip",1
347,I would not order the ink cartridges here again. The delivery took a relatively long time and the packaging was badly damaged. I haven't experienced that before.,1
348,"The biggest garbage I have ever ordered, in the package sometimes the battery is missing, then it looked as if it had been used before. I'd rather spend more money and a part that worked....",1
349,"absolutely unwieldy - actually wanted a larger replacement for the previous model - but this was much better in handling (here the camera is upside down, the lenses are then very difficult to access, all in all too narrow....) This is not a useful further development for me! The bag goes back!",1
350,"The mat arrived on time in an oversized cardboard box, but somehow they forgot to at least attach it to the bottom of the box so that it stays in shape. So she was already waving in the box because there was nothing there that would have kept her in shape in any way. Now she already has big 'waves'. I haven't used them yet, I have to see how I make them usable.",1
351,"Unfortunately, nothing comes out of the seeds. I have taken really good care of them to attract them, but the only thing that grows out of the earth is weeds. Really a pity, I was really looking forward to the product.",1
352,pretty product! Had to be sent back because broken. New order does not work several times. What kind of company is this?,1
353,"Unfortunately, the experience with the product is very disappointing. The hair cannot be styled as described in the film or as described on the package insert. In addition, various plastic parts came loose - unfortunately the processing is inferior. But now comes the biggest mistake: If you want to return the product, this is not possible because of allegedly too high shipping costs. You can keep the scrap and get 15 € credited. So you pay a lot of money for scrap that you don't want to have. If I had known that, I would never have bought the piece!",1
354,I WILL NEVER BUY BRI AMAZON AGAIN THERE IS ONLY JUNK HERE,1
355,Got a curved nose piercing instead of the plug.,1
356,There was no power plug included you can tell me how to charge the device. For such a service I can not judge positively.,1
357,"Worst bulletproof glass I've ever had.. it sticks, so to speak, only an adhesive strip on the edge of the display which leads to the fact that just with the heat outside the glass slips and you get it out of the trouser pocket and half still stick the glass to it. totally useless. In addition, the glass makes the display very milky and reflects without end, since in principle nothing adheres to the display but only to the edge.",1
358,"Illogical, embarrassing act. Stupid faces, stupid dialogues. The whole thing was shot on a total of 800 square meters of land. Most of the scenes are implausible. They tried to build up a mystery but in fact I had over an hour the suspicion that the crow Jackson is just on crack. I didn't really have any sympathy with the Mysterious Penner People. Actually, with no one from the story. Would give minus 3 stars if it would go.",1
359,Product tastes well. Value for money In my opinion very good. 24 hours delivery despite offered by Amazon Prime not nearly confirmed.,1
360,"I would not buy these earrings anymore the out of 100 pieces were only 40 pieces to use. 25 pieces are so deformed that you can not use them at all and 35 pieces you hardly get on let alone the too. I couldn't complain either. I don't know why it works with other providers. The 40 pieces where were fine were like the rest very cheaply made, so light burr. Ps. Actually, I wouldn't even give up 1 star, but the only thing that was good is the short delivery time.",1
361,Touch reacts almost not or only by fixed pressure ! It also holds very badly! I can't recommend !,1
362,Unfortunately no help! Only by chance does it work to open a glass ... With the thorn you also injure yourself very easily... Just to throw away!,1
363,"Unfortunately, it doesn't work at all. We strictly adhered to the instructions and yet nothing happened after 5 weeks. Very disappointed for the price",1
364,"I haven't even had these shoes on for an evening, now the zipper is already over. So already disappointing",1
365,"The description of the item provides for a length of the bracelet of 14.5 cm. The supplied bracelet has a length of only 12.5 cm. The seller grants a discount of 10%, which does not make the bracelet any longer. The bracelet is not usable for me.",1
366,"Unfortunately, the same error as with a fireplace from another provider. The combustion chamber is not well shaped (assembled crooked). The differences were filled with glue. On the model of the other provider, flames leaked here (on the side). Actually, I didn't want to give a star, but without it probably doesn't work",1
367,"Smelly, poor workmanship. Wanted to send it back, but never heard from the seller again. Hands off!",1
368,"For my taste, the first 3 episodes (only so many I watched) are just too restless. Will not watch the season to the end under any circumstances;",1
369,The device and the supplied binding backs are scrap ! Threading (binding) can take hours...,1
370,"I have not received a delivery to date, 13.09.2019. I think it's a pity that something like this happens.",1
371,"Unfortunately I haven't arrived yet. Long delivery time. Should arrive on June 1st, unfortunately not there yet",1
372,"I bought this mold 2x for small cakes. After almost a year, after I only used it a few times, the black coating peeled off over a large area :( And no, no spout machine, no abrasive, nothing like that, just rinse by hand. SO it is worthless, the stuff was also in the cake. The molds immediately ended up in the trash. Too bad, because the first baking results were very good.",1
373,Films are not self-adhesive therefore rather discouraged,1
374,"At first I was thrilled, I have been using 360° cases for some time, one longer the other shorter, because they either broke quickly or I was not satisfied with it. This one is thin, light, barely noticeable, gives a good grip in the hand and is cheap. But, already after 5-7 days I noticed that dust accumulates between the display and the screen protector, so you have to remove and clean the case once a week. I could have lived with that, but after less than 4 weeks the screen protector detaches from the side frame...",1
375,"Great power bank, as long as it worked. Already broken after four months, unfortunately can no longer be charged. It's great that I used them to charge my Gopro.",1
376,"Product purchased. Processing with Amazon as always great. Unfortunately, the download of the software does not work!! Thus, the device is unusable!",1
377,Got a cream with an expiration date that was already reached 2 months later... Quality otherwise I can not judge yet,1
378,The desk had scratches at the drawers and at the corners.,1
379,"Was installed by an expert person. Quality as usual from BJ. Unfortunately, the DImmer broke after 2 months. I can't find a way to apply for a warranty Sold by Amazon SARL.",1
380,Not at all satisfied have sent the pants back And still have not got my money back have contacted the seller he writes me that the money has been refunded although that is not true wait until next week and then I will switch my lawyer,1
381,"Unfortunately already after two weeks wearing broken! Was a birthday present, now I can order new 😕",1
382,"Well, unfortunately she couldn't try it. As many have already written here, it arrived broken and I had to send it back. Just ask me what happened. It was wrapped twice in upholstery film, but was completely shredded when I unpacked it. What a pity. Anyway, it's very, very thin glass.",1
383,A bit creepy for toddlers,1
384,I got ken products I want my money back,1
385,The windscreen is still pulled over the foam guard. This makes the microphone huge and the windscreen can be seen in the picture at wide angle. That's why I sent him back.,1
386,"I gave my daughter's phone as a gift. It was ordered in July 2018 and is unfortunately already broken. The apps have been hanging for a while. Already all the time messages often arrived very delayed (by hours). The virus scanner was deactivated by the mobile phone again and again (the same virus scanner that works with other devices without any problems) In addition, there were problems with charging navh about 4 months and now it can no longer be loaded, so it is off and not to be used again. Unfortunately, nowhere is the option to complain about it.",1
387,"Big crap. After a week, jump in the back. Then on the pictures you do not see that there is no protection in front. Never again.",1
388,"Unfortunately misrepresented!!! Since you buy extra a port for the Go Pro 2018, because it is explicitly in the description that the camera fits in - for the cat. Not a chance! Don't buy this for GoPro 2018! It doesn't fit and the description misleads you. Unfortunately wrong purchase",1
389,"With the Horizon-Go you only get a blurry image. Actually, the use was the reason for the purchase",1
390,Too fast broken not stable My bad luck,1

392,"Attention price 0,01 € + shipping costs 13 € Fallen for lure offer",1
393,"Also with me was directly on delivery 1 saber defective. When I look at other reviews, the system seems to have. And most customers keep the shipment with only one defective copy. A rogue who thinks something bad.. Also 2 more sabers have only lasted 1 week of use and are now leaking. Processing quality is also visually extremely lousy - The seams are totally frayed cut off, often just very scarce which leads to the defects described above.",1
394,The quality was poor. The part was broken after 2 days. Couldn't hold the air.,1
395,Doesn't keep what it promises,1
396,Never came. No star would be even better,1
397,"the watch is no good, it just stops after a few months... even after battery replacement. Warranty claimed and then the same phenomenon with the new watch.... away with it in the bin",1
398,Unfortunately no success with me visible and noticeable. Despite regular use after 8 weeks no difference of my nails noticeable.,1
399,The bracelet is unfortunately not well made. For the price this was to be expected. But because still is really simple chic and is comfortable to wear.,1
400,"The shipping takes a long time and with me it was added that the article was then delivered even later than in the specified delivery period. As a result, it came too late for me and was useless for me. For the return I had to pay 7€ myself. Can not recommend this provider under any circumstances.",1
401,"The product looks good and would be a real relief if it worked. As soon as the belt is under some tension, it can no longer be released. Under pressure, the locking mechanism no longer triggers. I had to loosen all 4 straps with the cutter knife : (",1
402,... held the lamp. Worst junk! Price too cheap to send back. Next time it will be a better rated product again.,1
403,"It's not worth the money. 10-15 sprays were the rule and the scent was not sufficiently intense. Nobody noticed him only if you really held your nose to your clothes you could perceive the scent. Because the scent seemed much too weak to me, I sprayed a test strip each. One with the perfume ordered here and one in a drugstore chain in the city. It was always the eau de Toilet. The one from the drugstore chain smelled much stronger and longer, more intense for about 3-4 days, whereas the scent of the one ordered here had disappeared within a day. Unfortunately, this was a waste of money.",1
404,"When distributing in the garden, very coarse pieces of wood have come to light and many small pieces of plastic.",1
405,I am not satisfied unfortunately the device no longer works as it looks like can complain,1
406,Unfortunately we had to send the product back because the quality did not meet our expectations,1
407,I find it soooo What outrageous it is not even about the money where that is quickly deducted it is about principle that we all wait for it and not even answered on email I wait another week if my email is answered after that I draw consequences,1

410,"Arrived used and without soap bubble water. Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the function yet.",1
411,I feel screwed,1
412,Haven't received the product yet. Appointment exceeded and no message. What should I think of it and then I am asked for a review because you know how it has to turn out.,1
413,The tempered glass films were delivered in normal envelopes. The 3 tempered glass films are all broken. Hands off!!!!,1
414,The title already describes it.,1
415,"Underground quality, even if the price promises a good deal, definitely DO NOT buy !",1
416,The goods come from China and can only be picked up against high customs duties.,1
417,The return of the defective lamp costs ( since bulky goods ) about 35 € So you have to keep the defective lamp by necessity. So the purchase price is lost!!,1
418,"Unfortunately, we had to cancel the goods, because we were not noted after an invoice request, which unfortunately no invoice can be issued. Therefore, back again.",1
419,"The last few months I was very satisfied with these tests. This batch, however, darkens for a very very long time. after 10 minutes they are still very weak. much darker after 40 min.",1
420,"Catastrophic customer service, the scale was already defective after a few uses, a no-name company that produces in China. Not recommended",1
421,"I bought this screen protector because of the very good reviews. First impression: chic and high-quality packaging of the two films or armoured glasses. Practice: The screen protector only sticks to the edge, whereby the adhesive area on the long sides is just under 2 mm wide, on the lower side a good 3 mm wide and at the top 1 mm wide. Since the glass on the rounded long sides does not cover the entire display, the adhesive strip is visible in the image area and disturbs. The tempered glass also does not adhere particularly well.",1
422,Did not respond to complaint after I sent pictures. Camera could not be installed because port did not fit.,1
423,Sensor does not work at all. The light always shines no matter which setting. Better to buy something high-quality!,1
424,Unfortunately after 4 years and little use already the heating rod defective!,1
425,"the pool ladder is a bad joke... But let's start from the beginning. The delivery was very fast and the item was decently packed. The construction was also easy to manage. But then that's it with the positive points! The ladder is very unstable and slides back and forth on the pool tarpaulin. The entered load weight is definitely taken out of thin air because with my 80 kg the ladder bends relatively strongly and I do not want to know what happens if it is really loaded with over 100 kilos. In addition, it falls negatively on the fact that although there are two rungs on each side, there is no support in the middle, i.e. you have to climb relatively far above the pool edge. Conclusion: the ladder is totally overpriced for its quality and wanders into the garbage with me.",1
426,"I ordered the bag for a festival wanted to have a completely black one as shown on the pictures. That every seller likes to set his mark Ok but must it be a butt that is oversized and MIDDLE on it.... I don't like hmmmm at all.... if I had known it before, I wouldn't have ordered it.... in addition, there is also the indefinable stain on the back is the not even scrape off with the nail (encrusted) ?!? Not pretty !!!!! Send back hm to order a new one until then it is unfortunately too late I will wear it and then directly into the bin !!!! ......",1
427,"The delivered jack did NOT correspond to the jack shown here! I would at least have expected that consultation would be made before any jack was sent to me, especially since I paid for it in advance. I will NEVER order FROM this supplier AGAIN HERE.",1

429,"Well, the lenses were individually packed, but both packages were opened and otherwise there was only an information sheet in the package. Very disappointing",1
430,"The delivered goods have no (!!) with the main picture (Figures 1 and 2) Agreement. Neither the color, nor the workmanship or quality match. Rough simple crooked wood that you don't want to touch, much brighter than shown, the handles much thinner and processed differently than shown in the main picture. Absolutely borderline deception and not recommended. An exclusive (!) Illustration of the real product would be more honest here!",1
431,"Beforehand... fast delivery from Amazon! Top :-) To the product... it says Sennheiser but qualitatively it is in no way a branded product. Unpacked the headset, plugged it in and immediately noticed a cable break. Very frustrating although I really didn't expect much for the price. So all that remains for me is to send it back and look for my luck with another headset...",1

Since the original part costs 200, - €, I wanted to solve the problem permanently and cheaper with the JOM system. The installation attempt in a MAZDA specialist workshop failed because the antenna of the JOM system did not work. The doors could only be opened if you were sitting IN THE CAR, but not from outside. So scrap and back. At Mazda, of course, I had to pay for the work and, in addition to all the trouble with the return, I threw 130, - € smooth out to the window, which no one replaces me.

516,"the shaft is much too tight. Due to the overlapping of the rubber, the rubber cuts into the meat. Result: cut on the foot. Not recommended at all - although they look nice.",1

518,"does not fit, too narrow, length inaccurate. not usable for me.",1
519,"The pump is simply too large to generate good negative pressure. It also sucks in more than it should, which is painful. A smaller one is definitely better. Thumbs down",1

522,Order unfortunately never received..,1
523,These articles disappointed me a lot!!!!! I have a very depressed mood now. Unfortunately there is no sound on the left handset,1
524,Poor quality. Very bad pressing of the parts with protruding pieces that can hurt you. Fell off after 2 days of attachment and a few chains hanging on it were then broken :-(,1
525,the worst experience in my life I used the device only for two hours and then broke,1
526,"What makes the smartphone is only the camera. The Huawei software cannot be uninstalled or deactivated and continues to cause problems. Reaction and usability takes some getting used to. Various elements do not work without a Huawei ID. Applications that use a Google account as authorization are unfortunately also not usable. Will switch back to a OnePlus even if the camera is not so good here. Phone sent back to Amazon. Acceptance refused and now I sit on the scrap, with which you can only take pictures, but as a smartphone is not really to use. Expensive tuition paid.",1
527,These eyelashes not only look super ugly and fake but do not hold properly at all. The magnets are too weak I have already had better ones for the same money. Getting into the trash,1
528,Never again! Was delivered too late or defective and subsequent delivery was then refused because 2 weeks too late and now 2 weeks later I still do not have the money back!,1
529,"The foils do not adhere to the edge 3-5mm all around. The seller makes the offer on request to refund half. Overall, I would advise against these slides as well as from the seller.",1
530,Can't even be done by others. Very disappointing unfortunately,1
531,"Nice picture, which unfortunately arrived completely broken ( with glass breakage ). On one side of the package the note 'Fragile' was attached, but the glass picture was not packed extra protected. Annoying! Return shipping with Prime possible, only with 3,40 Euro refund I will probably not get there.",1
532,The retaining plates are a little narrower than the removed original - therefore the spring can not be held. Here you either have to have a greater talent for craftsmanship or buy original coals (and leave the washing machine for so long). Very annoying.,1
533,"After only two weeks of normal use, they no longer work. There is only a noise coming out. Very disappointing!",1
534,"First class shaving water, unfortunately no longer available, for whatever reason .. Know a lot of people who have been using it for years and now miss it badly !!!",1

547,"Getting on time, but batteries all and a mouse does not wobble with the head.",1
548,"The knife is actually quite good. However, after some time, the glue that connects the blade and the handle comes loose, making the construction very dangerous. However, the blade does not slip out completely because it locks. However, you can not glue the handle yourself. For this reason, unfortunately, only one star. The review will be updated in case the manufacturer comes forward.",1
549,Really an impudence Since you don't know what else to write,1
550,"As ingenious as the game idea failed is the execution. The bags smell so pungent and unpleasant even after several days of airing out that I do not want to play with them carefree and certainly do not want to give them to my grandchildren. In addition, no information is given about the material of the bags, nor do you learn how to clean and dry them if necessary. What a pity! Here are big omissions of the manufacturer, which cause me to send the toy back.",1
551,Unusable. No reaction from the trader. Amazon mentions that I can send it back. But what will become of my money and the shipping costs incurred? The agitator was packed very poorly without padding. Metal parts looked out of the box. The power plug is for England or similar. But not suitable for Germany. So be careful!,1
552,Sealing rubber constantly slips away. The dust is carried onto the nozzle by the strong charge. The nozzle is always full of dirt (above).,1
553,"As soon as you plug in the adapter, no WiFi connection works :( the only remedy I have found on the Internet - wrap the adapter with aluminum foil, but this is not in the sense of the inventor.",1

555,"I was able to use the blender as a smoothie maker for 5 months. Then suddenly nothing worked, he still made noises but he did not crush anything and the blade in the lid did not move. Too bad, with a branded device I had expected more.",1
556,Much too expensive therefore sent back again! The package is really only 150 gr heavy and the price is therefore unjustified.,1
557,"Unfortunately, the battery lasts a maximum of 8 hours. Then you have to insert 3 new ones again. This is too much battery wear for me and too expensive in the long run.",1
558,"Fast delivery, well packed so I am already again with the positive things have it installed by a mobile phone shop Unfortunately bad quality and did not work at all!",1

567,"Nich Good for solsche Price:Very bad,ni buy against",1
568,"As noted in the other recessions, the quality is really poor, but a variety of tools included. Honestly, I only kept it because it got too dirty due to the test use. ... it fulfills the purpose so far, let's see how long",1
569,Cover was missing.. Product had already been opened everywhere. Description torn. TIME is too short to send back. Go on vacation.Hope that the cover is sent back.,1
570,Absolute garbage. Doesn't have 10! Grinding wheels held. Could mean it's China quality.,1
571,"Amazon Prime shipping simply top. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and checked all the parts. Here we noticed that the part has already been installed. On all assembly parts we have noticed considerable scratches and abrasions. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we have installed the part in the sink (Unfortunately). Only now we saw that scratch marks / streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably been delivered and sent back before. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion; Never again do we order such goods via Amazon but prefer to spend a little more in the hardware store where we get decent goods. Just think it's sad that customers are being screwed like this!!!",1
572,I returned this item with the other bra in white in a package as the fit was not optimal. The Hermes parcel service assured me that this works. Unfortunately I have not yet received a credit note and as a status does not come processed...,1
573,"The delivery arrived quickly. Thank you. Unpacked, mobile phone on, battery in, switched on ... and wow - works right away. Then the disappointment: Pairing via Bluetooth didn't work for me for ages. Therefore, the remote control functions on the handle were not usable. But even with Bluetooth connection, which I managed to do at some point (with Galaxy S7), the buttons did nothing - so no function in the phone for video start/stop, etc. After further research, it was clear: You have to use the app from the manufacturer. Okay, downloaded, started... and then it denies the service if you have not activated GPS/position tracking. What's the point? I don't want to know what the app spies on and then passes on to the manufacturer. Even more unsatisfactory was the video result with this app. Not liquid, jerks, etc. So the good piece is unfortunately unusable, even if the actual stabilization function is very good. Therefore, only 1 star.",1
574,In the video for this mop it is shown that it becomes totally dry in the dry function. this is far from the case! Wouldn't buy the Mop again,1

576,"I bought this mattress primarily for my son (9 years). I found it very convenient that it is H2 and H3 in a mattress. When I lay up as a mother I was super disappointed, both H2 and H3 I found just too soft, my son confirms that it is too soft. For the price I would have expected more, I am disappointed.",1
577,Again and again problems TURNS ON ONLY NOW AND THEN when you need it often does not work he then always looks for the sensors although Bluetooth is switched on Would not buy it again unfortunately missed the return date because I thought I might come an update and solve the problem,1

579,"I mixed this food into my dog's dry food, since then he has gotten very strong diarrhea. I can only advise everyone against it!",1
580,"Product was not ordered by me personally, strangely enough unfortunately never received. In my opinion, there is an abuse here. It's strange how you get ripped off here. Star rating selected only on the basis of this, so that rating can be sent.",1
581,"After the previous books, I expected more. The book seems unmotivated written and is quite overpriced with 100 pages for the price. The chapters are extremely short and simply lack the nice humor of the previous books. Very dissentful!",1
582,"It is definitely better to buy the tea in the normal shop! Online too expensive and no real benefits, return difficult",1
583,Everything there and top only the child seat for the doll is broken which is a pity .... maybe we would get a new one sent to us,1
584,"Color, size great, but after blowing up a hole discovered.",1
585,For the price cheaply processed and broke in a short time (3 long-haul and 8 short-haul flights).,1
586,"The first delivery was defective. Hot water did not run. Exchange within 24 hours thanks to Amazon. OK. The click flow to connect to the syphon is cheapest crap! Above hui below Pfui. Chrome part with foam seal at the top, yellow-white plastic with black seal at the bottom. All the crap is not tight and also extremely ugly when transitioning to a design syphon. Hans Grohe produced real scrap.",1
587,Have these shoes for a year now and they fall apart completely. Rubber goes off tearing and and and . No purchase recommendation at all.,1
588,"Also with me 4mm edge all around without contact. Can be press, but immediately stands off again. Thus unusable. Go back.",1
589,"I am very disappointed with this product from Ravensburger. The chalk in the bottle was clumped, which I unfortunately only noticed after the first use. The yellow chalk has not been clearly visible on the ground, the stencils fly away in light wind or shift if you do not hold them constantly. So overall not recommended at all.",1
590,"Was actually a little shocked when I first had the bag in my hand. Seems very cheap! Unfortunately, this impression was quickly confirmed, as the partition wall between the two compartments broke off after only 5 uses. Every time I use the zipper, I'm afraid that it might break the next time I move. The material feels very thin. The bag is very unstable and soft, hangs through like a sack, as a solid bottom is missing.",1
591,Much smaller than expected and poor quality.,1
592,The hose connectors cannot be tightened. Despite Teflon Band. It drips and drips. What a pity,1
593,"Nice string of lights, but not very durable. Ecologically a disaster. We had the necklace in the flower box last year over Christmas and now it's broken. Environmental pollution. Waste of resources. Money thrown out.",1
594,"In a month, two gamepads have broken, unfortunately pointless.",1
595,Little quality for this product in this quality the price is too high,1
596,I don't like the stickers at all because they are transparent. The writing is barely recognizable. They are not as colored as here in the picture. I wouldn't buy them again.,1
597,one good the other incomplete since the rubberized scraper is missing send back is not worth it to me at the price buy me better another one in the shop .the complete gets my wife.,1
598,"Actually 0 stars!! Foil sticks only to the edge but even that did not hold properly! When attached, the glass of a foil has already jumped to it. Is not at all compatible with a protective cover, as the edge comes loose again and again. Tried all 3 but none offered a safe protection! Therefore complained and sent back. Very disappointing!",1
599,The hose is certainly not a silicone hose in terms of burning behavior. It melts,1
600,"I still had the original. In comparison, I have to say that the fragrance is not identical. In addition, you do not smell it after about 2 hours.",1
601,"After only 6 weeks in the smoke detectors, 3 out of 6 report that the batteries are empty, a pity.",1
602,The sound doesn't sound good at all I can't recommend them,1
603,Fusselig without end even after the 10th times wash but for the money you can probably expect nothing else. Guess from the purchase!,1
604,"This product is great for tinkering, if only it would not have been defective after 2 adhesive sticks. After contact with the seller you were only fobbed off with you should contact the manufacturer.... Why do you sell it at all if you can't even handle your article yourself? If the seller reacts, I am also willing to adjust this review.",1
605,"Product never arrived, messages are not responded to!!",1
606,"Looks good, but cheaply made immediately torn and discolored not recommended",1
607,Device defective after 4 months. Seller does not accept repair or exchange. Not a reputable seller. Should send the tab to the UK at my expense and when it has arrived I should then receive 30 euros. What a rip-off. Have now turned on my lawyer Fingers away from such sellers.,1
608,"1.) The bottle arrived quickly, then the disillusionment. The bottle was in the box again in a plastic bag and when I opened it I came up with an exaggerated bestial chemistry smell. The bottle is NOT leak-proof. I think I should have read the recessions better. 2.) The smell only went out of the plastic of the bottle after hours of watering. I gave them away, because honestly, what do I add to my body when the plastic stinks so bestial??? That can't be healthy. 3.) The seller bombards you with e-mails to rate the product. If you do not do this, you will receive daily e-mails (I bought the bottle weeks ago). The tone of voice varies from nice to rude. I therefore do not give a purchase recommendation.",1
609,Huge problems with the return. Unfortunately it was not what I expected but the seller only turned himself across with the return.,1
610,"Very poor quality, with holes in it, maybe even a used item, at the amount of what Amazon sells by possible...",1
611,Unfortunately does not last long and dissolves within a very short time No matter how clean you make the display beforehand Too bad,1
612,"Unfortunately, I am not satisfied with the coconuts as the contents detach from the coconut and fall down. In the cold, the contents contract and detach from the shell, in the heat it quickly becomes soft so that it has no hold on the shell of the coconut. Would say that it could still be improved, as long as this does not happen I will have to buy my food elsewhere, too bad. Greetings Manfred",1
613,"I can't, the goods are still not there after 5 days, that's a pity snail-tempo delivery and that nowadays",1

616,"when is the update coming, it has never taken so long, where is the problem. we've never had that before, my god shit",1
617,Item was not in its original packaging. Battery became hot when charging and did not take up any energy. Article has been circulating at least once. V O R S I C H T !,1
618,and looks incredibly bad or comes folded. Is not worth 0.50 cents and goes back.,1
619,"Print quality is to forget, complete smeared, print quantity is ok. I can't recommend Product",1
620,Just bad. The film does not even have the dimensions of the display. I hope I at least get my money back!,1

623,The manual joint cleaners (wire brush with broomstick) run conical downwards. Why this variant has not been used here is not to be undertracted!! And that in the high-tech age !!,1
624,"this dress does not look like the picture, it is a sewn leaf is very bad and this fabric is very ugly is like nylon and is super clear",1
625,"I was thrilled with the idea. When the part arrived here, I was bitterly disappointed. Much too small and for my purpose. I wanted to get rid of the part as soon as possible. The seller gave me the money back and didn't even want it back. Now it goes into the bin. I don't understand why the product is not taken back. Is the seller himself so unin überzeugted of this? Is it possible to earn money in this way?",1
626,I ordered 2 pillows and both lint extremely. I definitely wouldn't order the pillows again.,1
627,The hooks arrived completely scratched and with chipped paint. Unfortunately no purchase recommendation.,1
628,"Just don't buy! The motion detector does not work at all! Got the lights for my closet as I get up 2 hours in front of my boyfriend and therefore can't turn on the lights. And even with the doors closed, the light goes out, but feels like it comes back on in the same second. With the doors closed, I should probably expect that it does not start again... A point because I just have to give one and because the lamp actually lights up and you can vary between cold and warm.",1
629,"If you want to change filters ec. you can do that well without the stand. The plastic part to clip in does not make a qualitative impression on me. The stand should only be included in the scope of delivery of the DJI Osmo, but more important would be a lens lid.",1

631,"Horrible season! Season 7 was already bad, but that's the crowning glory! I'm not buying Season 9! For me, TWD died!",1
632,Just don't get my order! I ordered the set of 28 and got one where half was less in it and only pompoms. After several correspondence the seller assured me he would send them to me but 11/2 months later still nothing but I do not get my money back. And they don't reply to my messages anymore,1
633,I never received it.,1

635,"The pots arrived damaged as the coating was rubbed off during transport. The pots are well processed externally, but due to the rivets on the inside and leaking gaps in the lids, there are places that cannot be cleaned or dried well and where dirt will settle in the long run. The pots (all) rattle / rustle in the ground. This is probably hollow and metal residues are loose in it. The seller did not react and Amazon had to step in. That was top from Amazon.",1
636,"A bit indistinct at the first announcements (2-3 words,,) from the navigation system and that immet again, then ok. BUT - headset defective after just over 1 year - no longer charges.",1

639,"If you expect quality, you should not buy this product. Thin plastic and small suction cups. Is just cheap, bought with false expectation.",1
640,"Season 5 took some getting used to, but Season 6 is a waste of time. Carrie's constant howling and emotional outbursts get on her nerves and her relationship with her daughter is endlessly rolled out. One wonders why this woman was not admitted to psychiatry beforehand... The story of Peter Quinn and his ordeal is dragged out too long; not to mention the logical inconsistencies of the season. - For me, the Homeland series ends here. There won't be a season 7 for us.",1
641,"Can only agree with me that the service of the seller is an impudence. I complained about a defective device and had to request the return slip several times. Was delayed until a warranty claim was no longer possible. After 2 days I received ""accommodatingly"" supposedly new device back - in my original packaging. The sighting of the supposedly new player then directly confirmed my assumption: same defect present, small marking on the device proved that it was the complained old device. Conclusion: nothing was exchanged by the dealer, only tried to deceive the customer. Due to the stalling tactics, no recourse via Amazon is now possible. My advice: Stay away from the dealer!!!",1
642,"We bought these rather expensive hearing protection earplugs for pressure equalization when flying. Unfortunately, they do not serve this purpose at all. Earache and deafness were the result :( They are ideally suited for noise reduction.",1

I had contacted the seller in the meantime, whereupon the goods were apparently brought back on the way. Unfortunately, the workmanship is very poor, in the silicone are small, hard, metallic (?) Foreign bodies - certainly not healthy when in contact with food and not conducive to the longevity of a coated pan... Furthermore, it is NOT the original Fred Funny Side Up, as the pictures suggest. The mold arrived loose WITHOUT packaging (only in an envelope). A point for friendly contact.",1

671,The biggest scrap on earth! - Printer works very limited via app with the smartphone (almost never) - Printer cartridges hold felt 20 pages - very cheap processing - after only one year the printer zigzag around continuously. For 3 pages you can calculate 1 hour. Printer often hangs. Also does not switch off and no longer reacts - sheets are crumpled and smeared despite proper application - printing process very very loud and very slow! I am absolutely stunned what a scrap Canon has produced. I would love to throw the printer out of the window. So please do NOT buy this printer!,1

Cost factor for KitchenAid hand blender and effective runtime did not justify the high purchase price. Then a hand blender does it for 50€",1
679,We ordered this roaster because of the good reviews. Here you have probably packed 2nd or even 3rd choice in the box!! The lid has been re-soldered at one point and is totally warped. Also the pot is not flat and wobbles back and forth on the stove. Impudence to sell something like that as a high-quality roaster. Tefal and the dealer who sold it are out of the question for us!!,1

681,The bouncy ball was described with a diameter of 55 cm! Now it is even smaller than the 45 cm diameter of the old ball for toddlers!!! The ball is not suitable for children from 4 and adults!! Maximum up to 3 years absolute impudence.,1

684,"Unfortunately I can not give a positive review. in my daughter's case, the entire liquid/contents of the case ran into the phone and the device is thus completely damaged. I wouldn't have given a star at all, because this product does not deserve a star in any way. If you already work or act with liquids, at least the quality of a shell should be highly guaranteed so that something like this does not happen. That's just to puke.",1
685,"I really and seriously did not expect such a scrap to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually works, Blu-rays are detected as unreliable as possible. The discs have to be inserted several times, then it makes Rödel noises as you have not heard them since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can either restart the computer because it will be nothing more or the disc will finally be recognized. But then you must not press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language or anything during the film. This immediately leads to an unrehesive freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.",1
686,"The pillows both arrived at me absolutely pressed in. I had thought it was only pressed in but in the (art) leather are even cracks. In addition, the rubber band does not really sit firmly in all places and fluffs terribly",1
687,"The style of the novel is inconsequential and mostly childish. There is no tension, so no arc of suspense, spelling and punctuation are not among the strengths of the author. No recommendation.",1

689,"The delivery was super fast. But at the first use after the assembly of the distributor, hardly anything came out of the shower for it on the knobs of the distributor. What a scrap.

But unfortunately I can only say, hands off. As soon as the shoes get a little tighter (that's exactly why I actually need a shoe dresser to make it easier for me to get in), the shoe dresser has completely bent. Unfortunately, it was not possible to bend it back. It has thus become unusable and has now gone back again. Too bad, because the length was great for me (1.80 m)!!",1

746,"Unfortunately, the car could not convince at all. Already at the first festival excursion, the cross-bracing of the front wheels on both sides is broken or literally torn. The car was loaded with a maximum of 35 kg. There were only clothes, picnic blanket and provisions for 5 people loaded. No rocking children or pets invited. The ground was a normal completely dry meadow. An absolute disappointment. Especially since the stated load capacity of 100kg was far below. The descriptive text advertises the robustness and the sturdy tubular steel frame.",1
747,"Please let me know the true, actual delivery date.",1
748,The article is in absolute short supply. The customer service is not competent at all and the shipping costs of the return you have to pay yourself. Absolute rip-off!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!,1

Every time you put it on, you start at full volume, which must be adjusted down. After a few minutes, the ears hurt because the pressure on the ears is massive. I have now purchased a comparable product from Amazon at half price, which is much better. There are significantly better reviews that have led me to buy. Maybe I'm the only nagger, who knows?",1

After about 8 months it started, during bus rides, train rides etc. so with certain vibrations you could hear such a strange cracking in the left ear cup. Then I read the reviews on Amazon again, that the headphones seem to work really often early anymore. I came to terms with the unpleasant cracking and continued to use the headphones without the active noise cancelling. Today, about 14 months after the purchase, sound now only comes out on the right ear. I am very disappointed. I have assumed that such an expensive headphone has lasted a few years. Can only say: Don't make the same mistake as me and buy these headphones!",1

I dispose of this pump and switch back to a normal one.",1
766,"Although I did not expect too much at the price, it is still annoying when screws are missing or simply do not fit. For example.B the screws for attaching the loader to the rails are both too short and too thin. I'd rather spend the money at IKEA next time. I definitely wouldn't buy more.",1

I already had 2 Phillips devices with vacuum - but they are much better, especially the old model, which unfortunately no longer exists. But also the current 7000 series is much better, except for the hacky cover. The blade of the Remington cuts very, very badly. The length setting is also very poorly solved, also you can use the shaver only with battery, not on the cable. and the battery drains quickly.",1
785,Scrap does not correspond to the picture,1

Flatulence like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has remained for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, with the larger full 5 ? This is very, very strange!",1

Unfortunately, this is of no use if the animals do not survive!!!!!! Due to the low flow rate, a barely visible current is created and the oxygen supply is no longer given, so that my fish and frogs are simply suffocated overnight. There is no way to set the filter higher to increase the flow, otherwise I would have to leave the aquarium lid open.

813,The parcel service did not deliver it! A failure of the deliverer!,1
814,"Actually, you buy a case to protect the smartphone from scratches, this case does the opposite. It scratches the display. Absolute no-go. The Smart View function can only be used if NFC is switched on throughout, which is out of the question for me for security reasons.

Then I was accused of breaking it and I was supposed to send both of them back by consignment. If only I had invested a little more money and sent it with insured shipping. Supposedly it didn't arrive. The highlight here: I was accused of never having sent it back! In fact, I no longer had a receipt, as I was informed by e-mail that the responsible clerk was currently on vacation. The that the goods did not arrive was never mentioned. The further correspondence was more than unfriendly! Never again!",1

821,"I can not recommend, with me it crumbles very quickly and a lot, in places it does not cover well and it goes off too quickly again. Once a little sweaty or slightly scratched already a place is free. Is partly also an unpleasant adhesive feeling on the skin, was for me only thrown out money.",1
822,"I bought the ModMic v4 in April 2016 via amazon. At the beginning of 2018, unfortunately, the cable on the controller for the microphone broke completely. The cable is not reinforced at this point, which will inevitably lead to a breakage during prolonged use. A lot has already been written about the quality of the microphone, so only very briefly: The quality of the microphone is okay, but nothing more. A Sennheiser PC350 is better in terms of voice quality. Let's see if it can be repaired. For this price and after less than two years of use, however, not in order.",1
823,"Ordered it because it was just so cheap and I can always need a bag. Actually, you can't expect anything better for the price. The color was pig pink, when I opened the packaging it smelled really strongly of chemistry. The whole workmanship is really grotty. Normally I would have thrown it in the garbage right away, but since there were scrap gnomes I took it right away.",1
824,"The radio arrived broken with me. The small radio is practical but the workmanship is still poor. - The window has fallen out - Tuner is hard to roll and broke right off - Signal is not strong enough + Sound is actually great, includes some noise",1
825,I used the device about 10 times. Now it no longer has suction power and is useless.,1
826,"I only used the suitcase for one trip (Germany – Australia). Result: One of the roles is canceled. The zipper inside is broken. Sure, suitcases are not handled with kid gloves by the airport staff, but still: You can expect a suitcase to last a little longer!",1

828,"So bad, never arrived no reaction. Stink sour . Since I never order again, money is debited. I'm curious if I get it back",1

830,"The HDMI distributor worked reliably for about 1.5 years, after which the first problems appeared. The device switched off sporadically at irregular intervals and now the indicator light lights up red, but the box can no longer be switched on. A battery change of the remote control also brought nothing. Conclusion: In the beginning everything was wonderful, then a sudden radio silence. If you buy cheap, you buy several times!",1
831,"I would rate myself as a very fair review writer and must say that I would have been very surprised if a purely natural product had produced such an effect. So yes it smells pleasantly like Mentol. And yes, it's burning... but not too bad. I would say who can not stand the little burning for the anal intercourse is not the right thing anyway. And no with ME it has not relaxed or weakened the feeling. But it's a pity.",1

841,"The provider does not respond to inquiries by e-mail and does not issue an invoice for the purchase. Highly dubious company, I can not recommend!",1
842,I ordered the light curtain for the second time now and both times the curtain came to me broken. The box in which the curtain is packed is much too small. The stars are literally squeezed into it and thus the stars break off at the slightest vibration. The biggest crap! DO NOT BUY!!!,1
843,Unfortunately it didn't work out.,1
844,"Too bad you can't distribute 0 stars ... Unfortunately, you can't say that these are hangers. Most are moldy. They are more than uncleanly worked and everywhere wood splinters stand off. You would tear your clothes apart if you hung them on them. Not to mention the mold on and in the wood .... Not at all. An impudence - goes back!!",1
845,Won't buy them again,1
846,The quality is underground!,1
847,"Since no zero stars go, I have to choose at least one... Very outrageous! Despite patience and long waiting time as well as repeated contact with the seller, the item has never been delivered and there has not been a single reaction so far! Very annoying!!! And not just because of the money! Never again will I order anything there!",1
848,"My father-in-law was to get the glasses as a Benz lover. Unfortunately, the glasses looked very cheap, a glass arrived ""washed out"", you could see that the glasses do not survive the dishwasher under any circumstances. Glasses were returned. What a pity.",1

850,"I am immensely disappointed with this filament. - First of all, the coil was not (anymore?) Vacuum-packed. The plastic bag hung limp around the coil. - The material is very hard and extremely brittle. I've never had a PLA like this before. During the first print, the filament in the feeder broke 3x. - And then the color! I ordered gold, I received a color that is more reminiscent of dirty yellow to ochre. In no case is this even close to gold! I wanted to use filament to print golden candle/tealight holders for Christmas. But due to this ochre-like shade, they look almost like diarrhea. Under no circumstances will I use these candles/tealight holders. Maybe I will try to beautify them color. In any case, I can only strongly advise against buying these filaments!",1
851,"Absolute impudence! I ordered this item 2 times and one of the two packs was OPEN and it even lacked a piece of !!!! Can't recommend the seller! I'm really angry! (By the way, return is also not possible) So don't order there!",1

856,"Actually zero stars. After the article was mistakenly sent from the UK to Germany to a packing station, I wanted to undo the mistake of redirecting the shipment. Only the provider does not respond, neither on its own nor on requests from Amazon. Probably the controller hasn't even been sent yet. But money collected. BEWARE RIP-OFF by stock discounts.",1
857,"Not recommended, bad workmanship and not to tighten, as the cords tear off immediately if you want to tense. Wouldn't buy again. Price performance is not right...",1
858,"Absolutely miserable customer service, package never arrived, the seller is not interested in this. Questions are not addressed, money has already been transferred because problems no longer seem to be relevant. My conclusion - Hands off!!!!! If possible, I wouldn't have given a star. Absolutely underground!!!!!!!",1
859,"I was looking forward to the set, only I am missing the illustrated adapter cables, how do I get them? Therefore, so far a star",1
860,"After a few months, the product disassembles itself. Seams tear open. Glued surfaces dissolve when exposed to heat. Overall, a scrap.",1

862,After two months in daily use! Unfortunately already broken at all corners. What a pity,1

868,"The weed killer did not survive the first use. It was once in use for about 1/2 hour, smoked briefly and has been broken ever since. Unfortunately acquired in autumn and only tried today, so I can not return it. A reviewer points out that you should only use the device for 10 minutes and then let it cool. But I wonder why this is not quite clear and large everywhere, when it is really such an important approach. Misleading!",1
869,"Unfortunately does not hold at all and pushes himself up. Therefore, not really recommended for me. Didn't last a day. I switched back to foil",1
870,"Unfortunately, not enough cutlery fits into the individual compartments. It is not useful for everyday life. Forks get hooked into each other. Unfortunately, completely bad investment.",1
871,"I bought the product because of the good reviews. But because I didn't like the slide, I wanted to read the reviews again and lo and behold, all gone! I can only agree, the slide is no good. It does not lying up and makes annoying noises when typing. In addition, the display no longer works properly. Hands off!",1
872,"Yes, the design is pretty, the binding is certainly good, the pressure of the dots precise, many sides, but: Each pen immediately presses through to the next page, or is clearly visible from behind. If you do not want to write in pencil or only use every second page, this notebook is ill-advised. Honestly can't understand the hype about it and will probably throw it directly into the bin, because I can't use it that way. Too bad, the color was so beautiful.",1

875,"The board is unfortunately only suitable for a TV match of the PDC. After 5 hours of playing, the field of 20 is already completely dented, so that no straight surface is available. Absolutely not recommended for the expensive price. In addition, the board is significantly softer than its predecessors. If you want to have a quality board for a good price, you should contact Winmau or buy the older Eclipse Pro.",1

877,Unfortunately 4 magnets are missing,1
878,"15 years of lifetime are promised. In reality, it was 15 weeks. Strong performance. Would actually say, that can happen sometimes. According to the reviews, it seems to be more the rule. At this price, the warranty claim is hardly worthwhile, as the shipment to Osram must be paid for itself. I recommend the ISY LEDs from Saturn or to dig a little deeper into your pocket.",1

884,Order not received,1
885,For my old Iphone 6 I had bought a total of 3 pieces over time and was always very satisfied. That's not the case with the new case for my new iphone X. The top flap does not sit correctly and wobbles. I don't think that's ok for the very high price.,1
886,It didn't work over built over. I am very disappointed that it did not work. You put that in the nose you get a weng better air through the nose and it falls out all the time,1

888,"I advise against this tablet. Already after 2 months it could not be loaded anymore. I sent it to Multimedia and it came back to me after 3 days. No writing. Tablet was still broken. Thank God I have an insurance that replaces the purchase price. So, folks, FINGERS OFF IT",1

897,"The headphones can be easily paired with the mobile phone, unfortunately then the positive, what I can say about the headphones, already stops. The battery lasts only 1 hour during the individual use of the headphones instead of 3-4 hours in the instructions for use (which, by the way, are only available in English). Which is very disappointing, as the battery life is not even enough for an extended dog round. If I had read through the other reviews, I would have noticed that it was partly about other products and that many are probably ""not real"". I will send the headphones back.",1
898,"The glass is not made for the P20. On the package was P20 on it, but was not in it. Size and cutouts were definitely made for another smartphone.",1

901,"Due to difficulties in delivery, the package could not be delivered to me. So it went back to the sender. He does not react to news and of course the money was not returned. Just sneaky.",1
902,Seller not responding,1
903,"After I plugged the lights into one of my 4 USB ports, my Smart TV immediately sent me the message to remove USB and turn off the TV on the main switch due to overload. It didn't work for a second and so the scrap goes back and buy me something more expensive, which will then also fulfill its purpose, hopefully. I will no longer order goods from China via Prime, as it does not work every time or only very poorly due to poor manufacturing. The one star is only for shipping, zero I can not assign.",1
904,"The full catastrophe, does not last at all. Put it on the Samsung S8. Until then, all good. But it doesn't last. The ""adhesive strip"" on the edge does not hold, as it curves slightly outwards. The purchase was money thrown out. The one star is already too good for the rating.",1

908,This order never arrived with me what I condemn as screwed therefore rather order others who cost more and arrive,1
909,"Delivery as always on Amazon very good, but the case itself very bad. Rather a 1 € article.... The case itself is so hard and inflexible that you have the feeling of damaging your iPhone when attached. In the upper and lower part, the color is not gold, but bronze !!! In addition, they are not exactly fitting, stand in the middle area. Overall, the iPhone looks like a cheap replica. I will return the case immediately.",1
910,"Unfortunately only 6 episodes received although the whole season was paid. Unfortunately, I can't find a link to complain about this.",1
911,"The cap is unfortunately much too small! My daughter is 8 years old and the description says ""for children up to 10 years"". This should be changed, the cap fits at most toddlers! Totally annoying and disappointing!",1

914,The things don't hold up well. The double-sided adhesive tape used is no good. Had to get me some from 3M (for permanently strong connections inside and outside). That is what it held.,1
915,"The watch is very heavy and clunky. It is overloaded with too many pointless functions (why do you need e.B. an analog AND a digital time display??) and the operation is cumbersome. All this is certainly partly a matter of taste. But it cannot be that a supposedly waterproof watch fogs up inside at the first contact with water and beeps uncontrollably from then on. I had been looking for a robust watch for everyday use and had not chosen the cheapest model. I very rarely send anything back on Amazon, but this watch is absolutely inferior and was scrap after a week (for comparison: my last watch had cost half and lasted 3 years!!!).",1
916,"The glasses arrived completely deformed. The liquid had leaked. A smelly smell came towards me. I immediately contacted customer service. For this five stars ✨, he offered me a second delivery, we will see.",1
917,I did not receive the package at all and yet the total amount was drawn from my account. This is fraud! How does something like this work on Amazon!!!,1
918,Camera is absolute garbage. Setup at mine not possible at all because camera does not scan QR code from mobile phone.,1
919,Bin sher disappointed not only that the box arrived opened and torn and no it can not be the delivery service because the box where everything was packed is undamaged Also the arc that should protect from the sun is not round but always buckles and looks totally stupid,1
920,"Unfortunately, I never received the device! After 2 months of waiting, no reaction from the seller. Too bad, hands off it! Unfortunately",1
921,"Attention, here comes the GT 710 in a huge package! Despite previous complaints, the error has not been fixed !!!",1

Unfortunately, you are without a contact person with the complaint.",1
925,"Runs, makes bubbles and does not become really hard.",1
926,"No matter how you twist and turn it. The slide is just too big for the Apple Watch display. So the edges and corners are all about 1/2 mm off which looks catastrophic. Much worse, however, is that dirt accumulates under the edges and the film peels off on its own. Result. Absolute waste of money!",1

932,"Displeasure did not fade me the BMW logo very much, looks washed out.",1
933,"If you want to project fuzzy colorful blobs you can order the part, otherwise the thing is unusable in my opinion. Unfortunately, I was dazzled by the far too good reviews. Also, I can not understand why in other reviews the build quality is mentioned positively. The flap folds forward far too easily, which is why I can't imagine that the projector can withstand Central European weather conditions.",1
934,"boring soft depiction about an aging woman who processes and celebrates her own rape abstrusely, not worth seeing.",1
935,My product never arrived! But should have been here a long time ago? If I get little my money back would be kind thanks,1

Then to soundtrack... German Dolby Digital?! that's probably a joke!!!!! Dolby Atoms is rather the standard in the 4K UHD price range!!!! UHD goes back with the criticism.",1
938,Only on the chafe the thing miserable,1
939,"Clock is i.O. For the price I like the watch very much. However, after only 2 weeks the light is no longer on. After I informed the seller, the answer came that Amazon was responsible. Nothing came from Amazon. Thumbs down!!",1

943,"Unfortunately, I can't give stars here. Unfortunately, the case does not fit on my Huawei P20 Lite. The hole for the finger sensor/imprint was completely missing. The elongated hole for the camera was far too long. The recesses on the sides did not match my switches (loud, quieter). As well as the recess for the jack for the headphone jack was not available. Basically nothing but the glitter. This is very annoying. This case was clearly not intended for my phone. Now I am forced to send the case back and order a new one. So unfortunately I wasted time.",1
944,"absolutely useless, enlarged in no way and then so blurred totally blurred, although I am not a glasses wearer I immediately threw in the garbage",1
945,Does not correctly measure the pulse during sports. Not useful for me. Should have taken more money in hand for what decent,1
946,Product delivery is very fast. The quality of the product is very poor. Making materials is cheap. The lights are not as bright as described. The water resistance is even worse. I am very dissatisfied. So much praise. Where did he get it from? Disappointed,1

948,"I have no idea why the mats were rated so well. First of all, they smell terribly of chemistry. During the first baking (extra without dough) a cloud of steam came towards me when opening the oven, that the tears shot into my eyes and it smelled again very bad. They also fall through when baking with dough, because the macarons are difficult to detach from the mat. I'll probably stick to baking paper and the good old sense of proportion.",1
949,The bed lost air after a few uses by only one person and the user lay on the floor in the morning. Amazon only offered a warranty replacement 6 weeks after purchase. The replacement delivery was directly leaking and is now going back for a refund,1

963,"Silicone and magnets came separately. A time-consuming fumble to insert the magnets. Fewer magnets were supplied than holes in the soles. Soles are much too thick, you need 2 size larger shoes. The silicone does not allow the feet to breathe and must be washed daily. The magnets fall out of the holes again. For me, not to be used.",1
964,"I understand the good reviews because of which I bought the phone not a piece... The device is ultra bad! It often takes 1-2 minutes for an app to open. Calls do not come through because they are only displayed on the display when the caller has already hung up again. The camera is also bad. The sound when making phone calls and playing media is tinny. For 100 euros I didn't expect super much, but that... that is really an impudence. Now wait for the answer from the seller if he takes the phone back and gives me the money back...",1

Since we do not drink coffee so often, it should be a cheap machine. The delivery was very fast, - as always with Amazon The machine was also well or safely packed. There were free capsules to try. Also very nice, however, is of no use if you get a defective machine like us. The instructions were illustrated, if you know Dolce Gusto, you also know the principle of how the machine works. We wanted to try out the machine and already at the first use water came out of the bottom of the machine. The machine could not pull the water upwards, so you did not get coffee. Apparently, the machine could not produce the print. Very unfortunate especially since I read exactly the same problem more often in the reviews afterwards!

Glass cleaner, which is used for adhesion in other protective films, does not work here either. However, the film only proved to be a bad purchase during daily use.

Didn't want to send back now because of 10 € but annoying because it is not described that way. Dust remover but a huge round dust to see or can you also say grease stain, glue stain can not be removed or wiped off.",1

1008,Some parts arrived broken. Very unfortunate.,2
1009,"The product was shipped super fast, fully delivered, easy to install and it was full to our satisfaction for 2 stars until we turned it on. The animal repeller is certainly effective, because what I can say with certainty it would also keep us away from the garden. The sound is extremely high, so that it hurt our ears, especially the children found the sound very unpleasant. Unfortunately we have to send it back because it is not suitable for everyday use for us.",2
1010,"Very nice stud earrings. Unfortunately, the first stones have already left 2 months after the purchase. Really a pity. More and more stones are missing, which of course does not look so nice. By good quality I mean something else. The studs are not really suitable for daily wear.",2
1011,"OK. The part was nice and cheap. However, the quality serves every cliché about Chinese products. Suitable for one-time use at a children's birthday party. Maybe even up to three times usable. After that, we could only throw it away.",2
1012,"Visually: ingenious! Volume: in a bedroom it should not stand, otherwise ok.. Cooling performance: within the framework of what was promised - in the very hot summer it reached its limits Durability: disappointing!

1016,"Not so my style. I read a lot of books / research by people who describe their experiences from this time or have them described. There are good and bad books. I would like to assess this one mediocrely. The story is really good. The story of the two brothers seems very authentic. What I don't like so much is the constant change between the epochs of time. In my opinion, these changes ""defuse"" the tension of the story. Also, episodes are not written so far to the end, so questions often remain unanswered. Disturbing is then also the change between the two main actors and Karl's son. The beginning of the book was actually not started so badly, but the author somehow left his writing style or he was pressed for time.... As already mentioned, in the end many questions are still open. Not a book that you don't want to put away with tension.",2
1017,Have already bought Michel Schneider wine several times and was always satisfied. The last delivery had a musty - earthy aftertaste,2

1026,"After dyeing, I was very happy with the shade, as it exactly met my expectations and the hair actually felt very healthy. A big minus point, however, is that the paint washed out much too quickly. Only after 2 weeks it had to be recolored again. My conclusion: the product does not keep what it promises, so unfortunately I will not buy again.",2
1027,"Had to pay for the product postage. Seller wanted to take care of it, but received no answer despite asking.",2
1028,"I liked the bottle very much. Great optics and also otherwise a very good impression. Unfortunately, the bottle broke immediately at the first crash (from a height of about 20 cm). So it is not more stable or better than any glass bottle without protection, which I can buy for a few euros. What a pity.",2
1029,I immediately contacted the seller and got.quick answer very friendly everything in order again much. Thanks to the seller,2
1030,"Doesn't keep what it promises. Worn out after a summer. Too thin quality. Well, at this price you can't expect more.",2
1031,"Unfortunately, I am very disappointed. Visually very nice also with the handling which is removable is well done. But the quality is a disaster. Everywhere the seams go up or the tulle tears. Completely unsuitable for small children.",2
1032,We opted for this shower system when remodeling our bathroom. Are unfortunately not very satisfied. Coating peels off after one year of use. Overall very wobbly the holder for shower heads.,2
1033,"So I don't quite understand all the positive reviews... In itself, the book is quite ok. There is information about essential oils and includes many recipes. What I'm missing, however, is a description of the oils themselves... so, e.B. what effect they have and why they can be useful for this and that ailments. Of course, you could not list everything in detail, but at least the most famous oils could have been described in more detail. In addition, I have to say, the book is written in a funny writing style. It kind of reminds me of the school days when we had to give presentations. The spelling and the sentence structure would have to be revised... So, if you are looking for recipes, this is well served, but if you need more knowledge about individual essential oils, you are wrong here. What a pity...",2
1034,Forgot the controller which I think really sucks.,2
1035,"The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are delivered which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which consists of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I did not complain about it as I needed this product urgently. The supplied adhesive hardly holds, but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which does not get hard. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least this one was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. The stencils are partially incompletely punched out. For single use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high-quality product.",2
1036,The quality was good but there was delay with the delivery And there is a product that I still receive,2
1037,I don't like the glass at all. The edge is clearly visible and with my wife it is already torn several times.,2

1039,"Unfortunately, it does not keep what it promises... have another sleeping bag and this one is also much thicker...",2

1041,"We played all parts except for the tomb of pharaoh. There were many cases that we liked very much. But here the desire has passed us after about 2 hours, so that we did not play until the end. It was no longer fun for us. The worst part of the series so far. Of course, every feeling is different, so everyone should try it out for themselves if they like it. We found the puzzles difficult to solve.",2
1042,"Actually a great Einkochautomat....,now sent back for the 2nd time. The tap dripped on the first pot directly when trying it out. With the exchange device the same only after 6 weeks. Now I didn't take a replacement, but the money... even after almost 2 months.... be paid out. Many thanks to Amazon for the friendly customer service. The exchange worked smoothly and promptly.",2
1043,"The goods arrived punctually and flawlessly. However, in retrospect I tried to contact the dealer by e-mail (request for an invoice). Three messages - no reaction! Worse or no service at all!",2
1044,"For me personally, the book was too little conventional medicine and it rather only summarizes what I already knew anyway. Personally, it does not seem very helpful to me.",2
1045,"Smells great, but is not recommended! There are many other Wella products that are much better !",2
1046,"From me there are only 2 stars, because the workmanship is rather bad and therefore the price-performance ratio does not fit. Very unfortunate, I searched for such narrow boxes for my kitchen drawer for a long time.",2
1047,"I was very happy when I discovered these space-saving hangers, as we just have very little space to paken. Well. What shall I say. Unfortunately, the hangers are not that space-saving. It may be that you can pack more clothes in the cupboards, but you have to expect that the whole thing hangs down so much that you can no longer pack in the lower area. (see pictures) 2 stars for fast delivery and for problem-free returns.",2
1048,"Unfortunately very poorly packaged. Out of 10 tea lights, four were broken.",2
1049,At the moment I can't create a review. Since I still haven't received an item after over a week. Although it should arrive 3 days ago with me. I'm curious if it will come at all.,2

1054,"Very disappointing. To support my change in diet, I tried these globules. I was neutral about the matter. But even after several weeks of testing, no increased success has been achieved. Maybe it also depends on the person - for one it works and for another it doesn't ...",2
1055,Unfortunately I have to inform because I have ordered this vacuum cleaner new and unfortunately somehow received a used one which I find extremely outrageous and cheeky and unacceptable with dents other damage and use traces arrived here see pictures is not normal so of course there are also new used ones from the seller which are about 60 € or the same but I have ordered a new device of 120 € and get a used one with considerable damage really regrettable something like this 😡,2
1056,Ordered it for my mother. The tapes adhere very badly to the skin (thoroughly cleansed / degreased) and usually detach completely when you push the earring through. May not be suitable for every skin type.,2

1060,For the price go the fans. But would not buy them again are too loud for me in the company.,2
1061,"In itself, the eyelashes look very good, but are difficult to attach. When you have finally managed to attach the eyelashes reasonably neatly, it takes less than 5 minutes and they hang next to it again, too bad.",2

1063,"... unfortunately the LEDs are gradually getting darker and so it looks quite stupid when some balls shine very bright (normal) and others very dark... I'm curious when they will fail completely... wouldn't buy it anymore, too bad!",2

1066,"So far, I had liked the electrical series of E. L. Todd best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. The part is about volt and Taylor's feelings all the time and I found it unnecessarily prolonged. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to herself and then is like a little child with every quarrel and warps?! At the same time there were also disagreements, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said Taylor would like him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor could not do without him and that he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I was hoping that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is volte-ex. That would bring more suspense back into the story.",2
1067,"This wheelbarrow is only for customers who are skilled in craftsmanship and have screws and nuts in different sizes.... because: nothing fits together here! Screws too short or too long, metal sleeve in the wheel not in the middle... etc. Have fun crafting.",2
1068,"So I once built a nice sitting area myself (see photo) Since the color selection was not easy for me, I just ordered red and anthracite, on the left are seat cushions from the hardware store. What is important to me and certainly to everyone else here, should be the seating comfort. Pallets are not exactly soft and therefore the upholstery should be all the softer and more comfortable, which I unfortunately can not say with this product. In itself, the quality does not seem to be very bad at first glance, but the comfort is unfortunately not sufficient. I finally decided on the pillows from the hardware store",2
1069,Probably unfortunately no ultrasound . No movement of water on the device. Only vibration and light. Too bad as it was very handy. Went back,2

Why that I don't know, but I think the trap triggers from the inside to the outside which is not good if the mouse pinches itself or something. On the other hand, the mice are probably very sensitive, trap too small? Well anyway as a live trap I would not recommend this trap.",2

Since it should sit so tightly and I did not want to fight my bust in an S or M.... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and hips... in the rest I could swim. In addition, the lining material came to you as soon as you opened the package and spread everywhere. Just a pity.. It will be returned :/",2

Some of the parts do not fit together properly and could not be put into the intended opening even with great effort. Then the roof beams, the saddle holders and the brackets for the potions were missing. And also the hinges for the windows are so unstable that after 2 days the windows fall off. So I'm very disappointed. For just under 100 euros you can expect something better. Not to be compared with schleich or Playmobil. I have now written to the company and am waiting for a response.

The rSAP profile, which is otherwise available from Samsung, is unfortunately not available for the German version. Unfortunately, there are no solutions from Samsung. Camera has many features that I don't need. In my opinion, the S10 is not a phone that just makes top calls, as the reception in the car is worse in my opinion than with other phones. Wouldn't buy it again.",2

My son was so disappointed and cried so I wrote to the seller and hoped for a replacement.... but what came back? NIX, no answer at all :-( Good service can be recognized by the complaint processing and the service is ONLY BAD here.

The magnet itself is very strong, but the ball joint is too weak, so that it already lets the iPhone sink down without any vibrations. The charging function is given, which works perfectly. The biggest impudence, however, is that I have an obviously used device (the adhesive surface on the metal ring, which you should stick to the mobile phone, is protected with a foil, which has already been agreed off and uncleanly made back on it, the holder itself was loose in the packaging, the packaging itself already had cracks). Conclusion: After 2 minutes of testing directly requested return slip. On the one hand, because it doesn't work with the advertised iPhone 8 Plus, but mostly because it was already used. The two stars are there, because it certainly works for lighter devices.",2

Via Bluetooth headphones, the user interface spins during calls and you don't hear anything either. Actually, since the Moto G2 I was convinced that I had found my phone manufacturer. The G2 was one of the best smartphones I actively used over a long period of time. When at some point the speed became a little too low, the memory too scarce and the battery life shorter according to age, I had to replace it about a year ago and decided on the G4. A mistake, as I know today. The phone itself is actually really good in terms of performance and equipment compared to the price and would also fully convince me if the entire construction series of the G4 would not suffer from the two problems known above. Maybe it's because the division is handed over to Lenovo, I don't know. It's hard to think about whether I'll give the G5 another chance. However, I strongly advise against the G4!",2

The 5L key has a curvature on the bottom of both sets, so that it does not stand straight and even but wobbles. The bottom of the sheet metal can be pressed in, whereupon it is then level again, but as soon as weight is in the bowl, the bottom curves outwards again. That's worth 2 stars deduction for me alone. Otherwise, it is completely usable and of course reasonable to the price. Supplement. In the 2nd set even the middle of the 3 bowls ""eiert"" as well.",2

I find it very disturbing that the smartphone app when moving the camera, despite good and fast mobile reception when swiping up, down, left and right, the image hooks and stops. It is also annoying that I do not receive any sound from the monitored room via the PC software and also the intercom does not work. However, the installation is quite simple.

In fact, this is so small that as soon as the eyesight decreases even minimally, it is definitely no longer visible. In addition to the effort of having to use a magnifying glass every time to set the alarm time, the circumstance is of course extremely bad for the ego. The really annoying thing, however, is the necessary effort. I want to be able to set my alarm clock easily and quickly without having to use glasses or a magnifying glass. My eyes are not that bad yet. My eyes are not that bad yet, but this font size is beyond good and evil. 2. in addition, such a caustic, penetrating wake-up sound that the body instinctively does everything in its sleep to wake up before the entered wake-up time, just to escape this brutal signal.

1261,"I do not want to comment on the quality and effect of the product at this point, this is always difficult with cosmetic products anyway. However, the price is much too high. In every drugstore you get this product many times cheaper.",2

1263,"we bought the scale because we had expectations from a manufacturer like ADE. Visually and from the display, the scale was very nice. The connection via Bluetooth was more of a matter of luck - sometimes it worked, then again not. Too bad! That's why the scales went down. We now have a scale from Nokia, which transmits the data via WLAN to the smartphone - this works much better (especially the smartphone does not always have to be in the range of the scale with Bluetooth connection and open app, as the data is also transmitted automatically later).",2
1264,"Already after a very short time has also shown a strong wear of the paint. Now it doesn't look so nice anymore. I'm a bit disappointed. But in itself, the shell is otherwise very stable.",2
1265,"On the whole, the mask is more ideal for decorative purposes. Rather unsuitable for carrying because it is so demolished by transport (due to the outer packaging) that it is not fun to wear. The processing is rather mediocre. On Amazone there was fortunately for 22 € a great alternative. Nevertheless, for the price you can not make high demands!",2
1266,"I don't like product. Absolutely unsuitable for streaming... In low quality, it has begun to interrupt after 15 minutes. In a better quality was directly failed. So not recommended.",2
1267,"Our child and we found this Bento Box really great. Is really very nicely divided and leak-proof. Easy to open and close. But unfortunately it has now broken after 1 month of use in school and it is not a user error, but a production error, since there have been two breaks on both sides of the inner box in both places of the bentobox... What a pity... But Amazon easily took back the Faulty Box and refunded the money.",2
1268,"The mat arrived very quickly and I was also enthusiastic at first. The imprints of the belt were visible and did not go away, but that did not bother me. Now, however, after only a few trainings (yoga) dents are in it and the mat is warped. Since I had hoped for much more of it, since I paid 20 EUR (currently it seems to be cheaper).",2
1269,"already during unpacking it could be seen, one of the tubes with the scales has a crack, system is leaking as a result. With regard to the quality of the material, I will spare myself any further statements. The only positive: for the price you do not get a 15 m hose in the BM. Will exchange the part.",2
1270,Oh oh oh I wouldn't have expected that from Carrera Unfortunately you can no longer speak of the good old Carrera quality it fulfills its purpose - but that's it but also very very unfortunate,2

1274,"The umbrellas arrived quickly. However, in my opinion an absolute cheap production. Some umbrellas were already broken, often at the top of the white cap (knob). Of the blue ones, only 4 or 5 were there, which was a pity. I'd rather spend more money next time and buy something higher quality",2
1275,"In principle, the game is well structured. Nevertheless, it cannot convince me 100%. For a little daddling from time to time, it's perfectly fine.",2
1276,"The connections on the hose are leaking and draw air, which means that suction power is lost. When used, the device is incredibly loud and it is recommended to wear noise protection if you want to do without the whistling in the ear. Overall, the vacuum cleaner does not look very well processed and also the price / performance ratio is not right for my taste. The included cleaner seems to be good and also the smell is acceptable. For small areas, the vacuum cleaner is sufficient, but if you want to clean an entire carpet with it, you have a task for the day.",2
1277,I bought several of these polo shirts and unfortunately one ran in while washing. Return of the unoved and unworn Polo's does not seem to be possible now... It's not fun.,2

1279,"If you know how to attach it, that's really a great part. Only if you don't attach it to the right place, it's just as bad as everyone else. I don't think it's good anymore, because unfortunately it keeps falling down. no matter how it is fixed in the ventilation. I wouldn't buy it anymore after I've really bought a great piece.",2
1280,"The network cabinet unfortunately came three weeks too late than announced. On the first request to the seller, it was said that it will take another week. When the week was over and asked again, the same statement came. The cabinet also came, but it had a few flaws. Since we now urgently needed it, we decided not to complain about it. When we told the seller that the cabinet had defects and that we could not send it back due to the long delivery time, only a ""Sorry"" came. Otherwise, no further concessions or proposed solutions. The cabinet still fulfills its purpose. However, the long delivery time, the not so great contact, the shortcomings and the lack of customer orientation is a no-go.",2
1281,"The old Polly Pockets were really much nicer. But I already knew that when I ordered this one. Unfortunately, the closure does not close properly, if we are not careful, we lose everything. This is very annoying. Of course, my daughter didn't want to give it away anymore, so I could have complained about it. The quality leaves much to be desired. But she still likes to play with it.",2
1282,Who buys cheap 😂 buys expensive. Unfortunately,2
1283,"Unfortunately, the product already had a scratch when unpacking. And after not just one day, more were added. The case is beautiful, but not suitable for everyday use because it quickly gets scratches",2

1289,"The vibrator lasted a month He didn't want to work anymore. Thank God I didn't buy another one In retrospect, I was doubly disappointed",2
1290,"Delivery promptly; Function can also be activated without any problems. Volume of the sound from the receiver is much too low - e.B. receiver in a pocket + in the box = 0 chance to find! If the receiver is exposed, location is possible. For people who no longer hear well, this sound (very high sound frequency and much too low volume) is most likely no longer perceptible --> therefore not recommended for this group of people !!",2
1291,"This is a complete faulty construction. Actually, the drain should remain open when inserting the sieve, but the ball is also installed. The stopper sits so close to the cup that the drain is immediately ready when inserted. Was unfortunately a bad purchase, because the water should drain independently when briefly pulling up the plug and the plug remains in it. Here the sieve must always be taken out. A conversion with the rod from the old is also not possible, since the rod can not be unscrewed from the new basket.",2

1296,"So the shipping was super fast. I was very surprised. For the price I did not expect anything luxurious now, but I find the workmanship bad despite the low price. The boards are splintered at the edges and the aluminum struts are scratched. I would never use such a box for the car. Since the dog only hurts in it even without an accident. It is still good that it is nice and big. We now use them indoors as a cuddly blanket. And then let's see.",2
1297,"Cheap, elegantly sporty-looking metal bracelet, without any accessories.",2
1298,"After a few weeks, the edges turn upwards, the pad is no longer flat, which leads to dropouts of the mouse. Very cheap quality. In practice, it also turns out to be a bit too small.",2

1300,"The lamp hardly absorbs any energy even though the solar cell is in direct sunlight. Accordingly, it almost never shines and if then not bright and only briefly.

1310,"Unfortunately, I have to correct my recession a bit. After I have been using the charging cables for almost two weeks now, there is the following problem: The chrome-plated plastic frame of the USB port, which is plugged into the charging socket on the smartphone, detaches and remains on the counterpart of the charging cable when disconnected. This is very annoying, because I can not use another (suitable) cable for charging without changing the charging plug on the charging socket of the phone. I'm thinking about finding another provider. Is annoying. I already had this problem with other manufacturers and was sure that with these charging cables the plastic frame holds.",2
1311,"... so as not to burn your fingers. However, the pot holders are quite stiff, which makes holding hot objects partly not very reliable. I therefore have to resort to normal towels more often. A vigorous washing in the washing machine has also changed this. So I'll have to get a few more.",2

Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the ridiculous processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On the 21st door there were no more doors and I had to allow more or less my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly because they came to him almost already liked. The parts often come out confused which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to attach the parts. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Most of all the windscreen. This is also very difficult to re-attach.) In itself, I would no longer buy this calendar and would not recommend it to anyone. Manufacturers may reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and make it better. :\",2

Completely unsuitable for my women's hands, because I simply lack the strength. My husband had to partially bend the car so that we could mount the wheels firmly. The wheel axle should have been only a few millimeters longer, then you would not have to bend the frame. Also the hood was really not to be attached without effort. On the whole, the doll's carriage looks very cute and our daughter also has her joy with it (that's why we don't send it back), but for the price we had expected more quality. We are curious to see how long the cheap plastic parts fix the wheels and when the first wheel falls off. Really a pity!",2

Also, the Qi charging function is extremely practical and has also worked well for me (iPhone X) Unfortunately, the alarm clock is only suitable for singles or people with separate bedrooms, as it relies on a permanent Bluetooth connection. Thus, all sounds that are normally played via the mobile phone are played via the speaker. If you manually disconnect from the connection, a signal sounds again on the alarm clock, also the connection to the alarm clock produces a sound. Thus, the alarm clock is unfortunately not recommended in a bedroom with more than one person. The display was unfortunately too bright for me even in the lowest level.",2

The blade does not cut really well after 1 year and the battery is flat .. it still works for about 3 minutes and then it is no longer to be cut with it. Can only be used on the power cable. I am very disappointed with the device. My old Phillips machine lasted with the first cutting blade for 6 years and was not much more expensive to buy! I can't recommend this machine after a year now! Battery is not replaceable as it is welded .. visually the set makes a lot but technically it is now for me something for the electronic waste.

1390,"I bought the device in early 2016. Once you have become involved in menu navigation and data transfer, it was easy to start a recording in the evening and transfer it to the PC the next day. Unfortunately, now, after 3 years, the OLED display is hardly recognizable. The brightness is set to the highest level, but you can only guess the menu items. I am disappointed that such a short-lived product is being sold again. Waste of resources!",2
1391,"What was the manufacturer thinking? Probably not quite as much, the cable arrived today so unpacked feel great workmanship and quality also looks good, so I just thought plug in. And lo and behold, it just doesn't work with a standard charger. You just can't plug it into the socket. I really felt too stupid and doubted myself. Please look at the photo so that you can see what it is all about. You have to say, it is in the picture to a fast charger which in itself is longer and larger than a normal charger. I tried to plug in the USB port the other way around, you never know, but puff cake doesn't work either. For me, it doesn't serve its real purpose. Just looking good is not everything.",2

Had previously used another Black Mask (given as a gift, unfortunately no longer knows the name). Although it was more unpleasant to peel off, it was very effective. The pores were really free and you could see it pulled out. Here unfortunately nothing of the same",2
1400,"The case looks good at first glance, the price is just as tempting, if it weren't for the edge that just doesn't fit tightly. If I held the phone with the screen facing the ground, I would be afraid that it would slip out of the case. What else can I say, that's just a no-go with a case - I wouldn't buy it again.",2

The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but there the hotbed is still too high and front Right the screw falls out, because it is not tightened at all although the hotbed is still too low. The poles holding the cart are straight as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do there, because so it is impossible to print something. To the construction: The construction was quite problem-free you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very exhausting. I have already written to support but after a week of waiting I still did not get an answer. Unfortunately, sending back is no longer possible. Expected a little more.",2

If you want to attach the reversing camera to the motorhome with bicycle carrier and license plate you have problems with the attached cable lengths and if you have a light strip with LED you can only clamp the cables to be connected into the socket. So not for laymen.Too bad",2

I would not buy this cave again nor that this strong reflection bothers me, when the sun shines on the mobile phone you see almost nothing more.",2

1424,"Delivery was faster than stated, I think good. Also the luminosity and the light color is very good and beautiful, very white. Assembly is a struggle. There is virtually no room for manoeuvre between cable and lamp. As a result, you have to be afraid that the lamp will meet you at any moment! The rail to which the lamp is attached is very light and quickly bent. This makes installation much more difficult and means that the clip closure does not hold too much.",2

1434,The plastic part to shorten the bracelet to the desired size is full for Ar.... It is an imposition to push the pins out. I would have liked to have given several stars but with this part you do more damage to the bracelet than to shorten it sensibly. Already at the first pen push out the thread breaks. Bracelet is ok. Risk of injury when shortening.,2
1435,"The controller offers good opportunities to improve handling when playing. Unfortunately, and this is the case with all Razer controllers, they break incredibly quickly. I bought it in January and in March the R2 button breaks. Absolutely unacceptable for such an expensive product. PlayStation controllers from Sony last for years despite crashes of tables, armchairs etc. I would never buy the things here again if there was another vendor for the kind of controllers.",2

Certainly it is a sporty sock that also compresses, despite this it is very difficult to go over the instep or ankle. After two uses, unfortunately, clear signs of wear and tear can already be seen.",2

The motifs are quite nice, but that's the only thing.",2

It doesn't look as dramatic as before, but I won't do it again to mess up my expensive Apple Watch. I already use the liquid for the second Apple Watch, with the first I was fully satisfied with it and now have improved what my eye is a deterioration. I did everything exactly according to instructions!!! With the photos you can see that at the edges, that does not go away despite intensive treatment",2

1457,The ear clamps are nice but unfortunately a pen is broken off after a little wear and thus no longer to use. I can't recommend the clamps. What a pity.,2
1458,"Ordered M instead of S based on the other reviews. The pants were too big. I was able to make the top fit with the adjustable straps. It looks really nice. However, I will return the bikini because the straps on the back are poorly sewn, so it scratches unbearably all the time. Have already got red spots in the appropriate places only from trying on. Too bad, because I really like the bikini :(",2
1459,"In the beginning, the bag convinced me very much. However, after about 2 months I fell off or ""slipped out"" with which you can attach the backpack to the stroller. And a side inner pocket dissolves and breaks. I am now a bit disappointed with the bag.",2

1463,"I had originally bought 2 pipes in black, they were perfect. 1 of them has now broken. Since the pipes are standardized, I thought I could easily buy a pipe in the same frequency when buying. I bought 1 pipe in green, which is the same as the pipe in black. Super. Have additionally bought 3 pipes in blue, which are much higher and shriller. I find the sound really unpleasant. Breakdown. Well, which pipes are wrong, which are right? Green and black whistle differently for me than green. The pipes were already unpacked, packaging thrown away and tried, so I could hardly send them back. If you don't want standardized pipes, everything is okay for you. But since I already had the pipe in black and liked it, I just wanted pipes that sound the same. And since they are supposed to be standardized, this would theoretically not be a problem. What a pity! I'm disappointed.",2
1464,Visually and priced okay. But what good is it if the zipper does not hold. Rarely used and already in the garbage. But with the amount you could have guessed that. But unfortunately it was only about the motive.,2
1465,Returned the item. The display cannot be read depending on the viewing angle.,2

1469,"More than 30 euros for a simple bicycle bell, which also only makes ""Bing"", is a lot of money. But the bell should at least be high-quality processed - but unfortunately it is not. The hammer does not hit the bell, no matter how many times you trigger it; the distance is just too big. You have to bend the hammer by hand until the bell works; this is an absolute NoGo at this price range. When you have finally made the bell sound: the sound is beautiful, it is a bit louder than other bells and the ringtone reverberates a little longer. However, is in no way appropriate to the additional price; I wouldn't buy this bell anymore.",2
1470,The handles are beautiful and hold well. The bonding of the nuts in the ceramic could be a bit more even and thorough... but no mother is out yet. Addendum: 3 of the 8 handles are faulty pity,2

1472,"The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and very loud. I couldn't turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly this is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall by hand. I always woke up when I turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. The colors and also the color change I found beautiful, unfortunately you can not dim the colored light. I also liked that it has a battery, so that in the event of a power failure, the clock and the alarm time do not have to be re-entered. But went back for the reasons mentioned.",2

1474,"The product has done its job for about 1 year. After that, it remained in continuous light mode. New batteries didn't help either.",2
1475,"I'm a bit disappointed. In the photo it looks really good and noble, but when it arrived and I looked at it closer, it seemed really cheap! Is probably a matter of taste, mine is definitely not.... Otherwise true delivery super fast, and the return with refund was problem-free!",2
1476,"The noodles are standard spaghetti. The sauce is not a Bolognese as seen on the product picture, but a tomato sauce that has become extremely sour compared to the sauce made of glass from the discounter.

1477,"Unfortunately, after using it twice (and removing it properly), the hard drive is no longer recognized on the USB 3.0 port. LaCie support in the form of driver downloads does not exist. Can therefore only use USB 2.0 and a much cheaper hard drive would have done that. What a pity!!",2
1478,In itself great product only the holder arrived broken and it is not really well processed. The loop that comes around the handlebars is made of plastic which is the reason why I did not order it again. But the idea with the magnet system for the crosscall Action x 3 is great.,2

It also glides excellently over my ROCCAT Taito mouse pad. Now comes the big BUT: The driver is a disaster. If you can't find the right one, the mouse won't work either. In addition, there is the following: - 1st mouse: Defective after about 11 months with double-click problem on the left mouse button. Exchange took place. - 2nd mouse: Here the left button was fixed if you also pressed the right button at the same time. Exchange took place. - 3rd mouse: Also this is now unfortunately defective after a little over a year (warranty expired) with the double-click problem. It cannot be that a mouse in this price class breaks again and again with the same defect. And almost always in the same period. I am a frequent user. This means that many clicks have already come together. A mouse in this price range must also be able to withstand many clicks. The mouse was neither thrown through the room nor treated with care. For comparison, my Logitech Mx518 has provided about 5 years of impeccable service. At almost the same price. AND the driver was easier to handle.",2

I would also have liked to have photos that show the position from behind. So you would have got a better representation like e.B. the arms are bent or stand away from the body. Furthermore, it gave me too much information about the career of any people. I ordered the book to watch exercises. The other one really didn't interest me. I then did it in such a way that I watch the exercise in the studio with my smartphone beforehand and then do it. I find it more informative than with this book.",2

In the beginning, everything went quite well. However, the paint went off quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this is also possible with a cent coin, but also only with a cent coin. I did not find a suitable slotted screwdriver that would not have ruined the whole screw immediately. To get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. It is nice that you can put the screw on different sizes or lengths through the different parts, but if you have screwed the whole thing first, you need a pair of pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the screw in the thread broke off during the third time I mounted and thus the entire thing was unusable.

But this time I can't wait for the change because the product was empty after a few times to apply. And no, it hasn't expired or anything else. I applied it as then daily in the morning and in the evening, but after 2 weeks it was empty. I'm a bit disappointed about it...",2

For 3 whole days she enjoyed the mobile phone, then it fell from about 120cm height on the edge, which should actually be protected by the case! Display is not only cracked, but now also has a hole. See picture. I advise everyone against this case! Although it is slim and simple, it does not protect the device properly. Too bad for the beautiful, brand new Note 7....",2
1673,"Nice phone, unfortunately after unpacking directly on the lower left side of the display felt a gap. This makes it sound very cheap when typing on the screen.

Hopefully this will be better. Updates will follow.",2

Instead of the promised 4 cl, 6 cl are served. In addition, the holders are made of plastic and look inferior. Unfortunately not suitable for our gastronomy.",2

1680,"The product only gets the second star because of the good idea and the design behind it. The fan completely misses its point, because it does not stop on the spot. The case is not made of metal, as one might suspect, but of plastic. That alone is not bad, but due to the too light dead weight, the fan rotates even on a low level around its own axis. So the wind does not arrive where it should go. It's a mystery to me why the product has so many good reviews.",2

As a result, the TV set had to be turned up louder and the living room was heated by the exhaust air. After 15 minutes of test use, I decided to send the device back again.

Several attempts to eliminate the problem unfortunately did not help. I have therefore again got a fixed, non-adjustable 45° stem.",2

1735,"After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems with the phone to ""connect"" over time. This means that you no longer charge even though you have pressed the ""Power On/Off"" button for 3 seconds. If you remove the phone from the case and reinstall it, you solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. Although these are not many gross defects, I find that a case with battery should work perfectly in its function and therefore I am, for the cost of 30 €, very disappointed about the product, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months.",2

After a long back and forth I installed it, but it was not to make it work, no function.

I use an S9+ so it can't be because of the image quality because of the smartphone I think. You can move the lenses on the wheel on the side and there was a tick liked to have a sharp image. The headphones made it difficult to sit on your head.,2
1740,"The processing is unfortunately very cheap. The screws on the lid were already loose after unpacking, so you first had to take the screwdriver to hand before you could fill up the spices.

1750,"Looks wonderful in the pictures. Unfortunately, the reality is different. The rods wobble back and forth because the rod that holds them all together is too thin (one or two layers of gaffa tape can fix that). The two screws above and below are not as it seems in the pictures just with the metal but protrude, which looks visually very cheap. I would also be surprised if the screws would not loosen by themselves after some time. Last but not least, even the rods are of different lengths. It's only 1mm, but I still wonder how something like this can happen at all. The only positive is the material, which - assuming a more stable holder - would probably last for years.",2

However, after the fourth use (within 2 weeks), the internal rubber hose burst or slipped from the anchorage.

And you can peel it off the artificial nails very easily after only 2 days I was already missing the complete gel on the nails and the others gradually came loose...",2
1814,"At first glance quite nice, but unfortunately the patches sit on the upper arm...",2
1815,My daughter is thrilled. Great animals. But constantly the game crashes. 10 times in 15 minutes. This is very annoying. When you finally fix this you get a full 5 stars,2
1816,"Unfortunately, the battery does not have sufficient capacity. My previous one had lasted much longer until it became defective. Should actually last much longer. What a pity......",2
1817,"I haven't tried the product itself yet, but there is a point deduction for the type of shipment - you don't fold A4 paper 2x! It arrived completely crumpled and crumpled, unbelievable. Further point deduction for the fact that I asked to cancel the purchase and the seller did not react to it in any way.",2
1818,"Had ordered the case because I assumed with a 360° case that everything is protected. Unfortunately, for the front it is only a bumper without protection, so she went back. Too bad because she made a good impression",2
1819,No better than a cheap product. I was really disappointed,2
1820,"Although I bought the cabinet with 3 shelves, I could only build 2 together. The rods have too few holes for 3 shelves. The fabric is too short and not beautiful.",2
1821,"After one season, the battery is already broken. I am very disappointed! What about the warranty? A replacement of the battery would be normal after 1 season",2
1822,"Bought me the thermal underwear as I work outdoors. In itself, the fabric feels good, but it doesn't really keep you very warm. In addition, the fabric cannot breathe. After 7 hours of (not strenuous) activity, everything was put directly into the washing machine at home and I had to take a shower. Since the fabric can not breathe, you did not notice anything from the deodorant. Unfortunately, a very big shortcoming! Too bad, but for the price I should have known better 😔",2
1823,"Was totally thrilled when I installed the printer. It was annoying that I could not connect to the laptop via W-Lan, but no matter, everything worked via the mobile app, especially since I wanted to print photos primarily.... For a month now, almost nothing has been working. Scanning documents becomes a daily task and if the printer manages to feed in the photo paper, he only prints a third of the photo.... it becomes similarly tedious if you want to contact the support. I am very disappointed and will soon switch to another brand!",2
1824,"Also the rubber lips of our stirring hooks are torn - now for the second time. Too bad, unfortunately I can not give more than 2 stars.",2
1825,"The brushes are great in themselves. However, they stink so badly that I really have passed the joy of it. After repeated washing, the smell does not evaporate AND the brushes lose hair. I think that's a pity... The only thing that no longer stinks is the storage box, which could actually be quite handy for traveling.",2
1826,So we had a lot of different results. Were then both of the opinion that we can measure and check better with ourselves.,2
1827,Device is much too slow and it lacked the key for the card slot!!,2
1828,"Several plastic parts were already broken off in the box at the time of delivery, but the box still holds for the first time. I keep the box only because of the really great design and because I only need it for the pool area (swimming goggles, air mattress, etc.), the box fits perfectly in color and I did not want to spend much money on it. Nevertheless, the price is actually not ok, because the quality is really borderline! The box is not worth 20€!",2
1829,Poor workmanship-----not recommended,2
1830,Unfortunately very loud therefore sent back,2
1831,I have already bought the cartridges for the second time CLEAR at the price you can not expect super quality BUT the cartridges print partly very bad colored to not colored at all and that after a short time. I will switch to another product.,2
1832,"I ordered 4 identical keyboards for the office. Everywhere the same problem: the radio range is about 50 cm. So you need a USB extension to place the dongle on the desk. The mouse fits well in the hand, but two stars.",2
1833,"Poor workmanship at the seams, as well as the adhesion to the soles etc. Otherwise, the shoes make a very good impression. unfortunately, the processing is not possible at all. Maybe this is due to the cheaper price compared to the other offered models which are much more expensive. Shoes went down.",2
1834,"The cover (thin plastic) was unfortunately broken! Have requested a replacement, also worked great, only that the lamp has the same damage again... if not everything deceives me, the same one was simply sent to me again!!!! 😈 Hopefully it fits the third time!!! 😡 Otherwise there would be nothing wrong with the price anyway! But the service did not deserve more stars...",2
1835,"I decided - also because of the many good reviews - for this more expensive product. I have used various brushes; these hardly rotate in the water; the performance is too weak for that. Outside the water, in the air, the power is enough and the brushes dry well. But unfortunately it hardly comes to that, because permanently the holder(s) fall out of the handpiece. As soon as the cleaning process in the water is to begin, the connecting piece falls between the brush holder and the handpiece. I tried it with various brush sizes. That's annoying. If it were to hold, the power to clean would still be too low for me.",2
1836,Water tank ok... unfortunately one has arrived broken.,2
1837,"It is not waterproof at all. After the rain the surface was dry, but it sucked water into it and after the ride I was completely wet. It's also not soft enough. The height is about 6 cm.",2
1838,Shaves gently but not really smooth. Too expensive for the result,2
1839,"Very nice string of lights, pleasant light color. No 3 spare bulbs supplied, therefore only two stars",2
1840,The leather from the bow came off pretty quickly,2
1841,"Fast delivery, unpacked, you watch could not be synchronized with mobile phone. Installing and uninstalling the app several times has finally led to success. Clock is under observation. The watch makes a good impression. Maybe the app should get an update as soon as possible. See other reviews.",2
1842,"I am not very satisfied with the quality of the material... I already keep the Revenger in a separate bag, but still I have a lot of scratches, on the display, which is already difficult to recognize. The plastic is simply too soft and therefore has absolutely no resistance. The fire button often does not work, you often have to press a few times to get steam. The display would have to be much brighter so that you can see something even in light. Set to the maximum, it is only clearly visible if you are in the house with hardly any lighting. The atomizer itself is top! The NRG tank is great and really beautiful in design and color.",2
1843,"The fabric is good and the colors look good. I wear normal dress sizes, unfortunately this monokini does not fit shape and does not give support. But if a swimsuit is the only thing I wear, I don't want to constantly correct the seat or straighten anything. In the whole short body height and too far km chest area. No stop for a beautiful décolleté. Return and refund only possible on individual negotiation. I now have a swimsuit that stays in the closet. I can't understand the positive reviews.",2
1844,"Unfortunately, the shell arrived already damaged. Without a break, it would look good. Unfortunately, the shell is very, very small.",2
1845,"Does not measure correctly... We have two more devices and if you put all three next to each other, the device shows 8% more humidity than the others. The temperature is largely there.",2
1846,"We tested the juicer for two weeks and then sent it back again. The juicer is designed in such a way that on one side the juice on the other side the vegetable residues are transported out by spinning. This means that if the leftovers are light enough, they will be thrown out. Unfortunately, it is then the case that not enough juice is extracted. Orange juice doesn't work at all. And: when filling at the top you have to insert the filler neck, otherwise it comes out at the top. Celery makes beautiful green spots on the wall. We bought a Slowjuicer, more expensive but much better!",2
1847,"The storage may be good, but I wanted to hang it behind the door AND be able to close the door. I would say that I have completely normal and standardized doors, but the hooks are still far too thick, so that just doing that leads to the fact that firstly the door does not close and secondly dents are pressed into the wood of the door and the frame. Don't understand that something like this is sold as a door shelf when the door becomes inoperable. However, with 2 pliers I was able to bend the hooks so that it ultimately fits. One has broken off, but the others are enough to carry the shelf.",2
1848,Is leaking not suitable for two people except for couples villt.,2
1849,Headphones already have a wobbly contact on the cable after little use. Very unsatisfactory.,2
1850,"These earrings are not intended for ear holes. On the contrary. Having ear holes could even be more harmful here. Due to the fact that these earrings use clips, it is almost impossible for me to bring them overskin to my ears. The upper metal part also scratches badly.",2
1851,"If you buy an underwater light for a pool... what do you expect then? The light should be waterproof at least for the water depth of the 20cm below the water surface... that's all you expect. Water penetrates, first rust formation after a few days, light can no longer be controlled! Away with it and never again ordered from the dealer...",2
1852,"I was initially very satisfied with this vaper - until I had my fingers full of liquid after a relatively short time. Very very annoying, despite the good rating on Amazon. Felix",2
1853,"After only a few times of use, the outer edge of the smooth floor has several cats all around, both inside and outside along the gutter. The mold has always been treated gently. The ring has no damage.",2
1854,"After only two weeks, the car stops working. Has now been sent back. The high battery consumption should also be noted. From time to time, the batteries have to be removed and reinsered so that the car works again at all. Why? No idea. Would have expected something better at the price. The car is quite noisy during use, not for weak ears",2
1855,"Easy To Use, Fast Connectivity, Terrible Background Noise. Send the thing back again. Expected more for 20€ .. and all the good reviews. Maybe it's because of the car",2
1856,"Shaky and if you do not roll it up absolutely accurately, it misunderstood and can no longer be rolled off and rolled up orderly!",2
1857,"I only used the whip for a carnival ball. After a few snaps, it has already slowly dissolved. So decoration ok, not suitable for use.",2
1858,"Initially, the silicone coating was helpful. The otherwise slippery pencil of the first generation was therefore easier to use. However, after a few weeks, the writing aid leaks out to such an end that the pencil slips up and down while writing. Therefore, unfortunately not helpful and disposed of.",2
1859,"Film is stable and self-adhesive with a light transmission of about 70%, medium sun protection. Is attached from the outside and reflects in daylight as described. I did not succeed in applying the bubble-free application either dry or moistened with water, so I am thinking about a removal.",2
1860,"I can't say anything about the above article, as it never arrived at me. Annoying was that the company had 4 weeks to do so and my costume at carnival incomplete. However, it was taken care of directly and I got the money back",2
1861,Couldn't find any success I'm still doing exactly the same as before taking it. Couldn't find any success! Me,2
1862,"Delivery quite fast, but product was difficult to glue on wrinkle-free. Seller did NOT respond to complaints!!!",2
1863,Unfortunately not clear enough for my concerns.,2
1864,"The memory card is certainly good and cheap. It's also great that an adapter is included. Unfortunately, the card does not work in an Amazon Fire tablet. That's why she went back.",2
1865,"Great in itself, the usual creeping quality. But the fence is a disaster! Very unstable when playing and thus the free play is often interrupted, because first the fence has to be ""repaired"". Very unfortunate. This product is not worth its price.",2
1866,"Unfortunately, the product does not correspond to what one would expect from such a well-known manufacturer. The kettle was bought 5 months ago, but not used very often, as it is only used in a second home. There are already rust spots and when pouring out the water, the water partly runs not only out of the designated opening, but also somewhere from the ground. My conclusion: WMF likes with pots and Co. but definitely no longer with electrical appliances.",2
1867,"After unpacking, I was overcome by the great disappointment... It is much too thick and too heavy, I expected a slim and elegant phone... Haven't turned it on at all, goes back. Too bad :-(",2
1868,"I found the excerpt interesting, but after the purchase I was really disappointed. The scenes (violence/sex) were written absolutely superficially, so you could not put yourself in the characters' shoes. Claire and Tony were meaningless characters and unlovingly written. The book had so much potential in the beginning and this was not used. At 47% I gave up. A real pity!",2
1869,"When I had read the good recessions, I had to order them right away, 2 pieces for the price sounded great. However, they do not darken and look brown in light light. In addition, you can see wrinkles (see picture) unfortunately not even 20 € value and goes back. What a pity.. who doesn't mind that.. but the fabric is surprisingly soft and well made",2
1870,goes so stones fell out,2
1871,"I have now decided after about five months, which have passed since the purchase of the smartphone, but to a review. In itself, I am satisfied with the functions of stability, etc., but it is totally annoying that the smartphone constantly switches off. At first I thought that it only happens when the off/on switch is touched, as it reacts totally sensitively to only minimal touch, but this is not the case. It turns off every few minutes, even if it's just on the table. I will probably complain about the device.",2
1872,"But they are not comfortable at all. Pressing on the feet. And are not very flexible, even after long wear, they simply do not become soft. Feet still hurt",2
1873,"Go like this, the scent may not be for everyone.",2
1874,I waited almost four months for this order... what else can you say... I already got these pipettes in the pharmacy...,2
1875,"The 2nd star is only available for the goodwill of the dealer. Replacement delivery and refund went smoothly and quickly! About the product: The adapter simply does not work. Often the laptop did not recognize the disk, and if it was detected, the USB connection broke off very quickly completely (opening folders was enough). Another customer also had this problem, see more reviews. After Inateck quickly initiated a replacement delivery, there was exactly the same problem with the replacement device. I had installed an older SSD from Crucial, which was easily installed in my old laptop (natively as mSATA) for years.",2
1876,The automatic lowering is already broken after 3 weeks. This means that the toilet lid simply slams down again as with a conventional lid.,2
1877,"I'm still trying to find out if the reviewers bought the same lamp as mine. Bright is different. Maybe great for children under duvet who play, but lighting up a basement that makes this lamp by no means. I have LED light strips in my kitchen,which are bright.",2
1878,"Unfortunately, the adapter does not fulfill the function, which is why I ordered it. I can charge and listen to music. However, I then have a quiet noise in the background and I wanted to have the adapter to charge and also to be able to make phone calls. Unfortunately, this is not possible. Since I can listen to music there are 2 stars. But still not what I wanted.",2
1879,"The display is not sufficiently protected because the film is too small (see photo). Therefore, the article goes back - too bad!",2
1880,"I can not rate, I returned the vacuum cleaner, because it was too heavy for me in terms of weight.",2
1881,"The key fob is very nice, but not suitable for motorcycle keys. After driving once, the trailer is already torn from the ring by the wind. For car keys, it shouldn't be a problem.",2
1882,"Have this meter now a few weeks, and have enough time to test it extensively, and have had to find that it provides too inaccurate measured values. According to the manufacturer, a deviation of -5 to +5 measuring points. Unfortunately, it looks like this, from three measurements in a row, measurement 1- 129 2- 172 3- 152 . I will not recommend this device because it does not meet the requirements.",2
1883,"I ordered ""Happy Dog Supreme Sensible New Zealand Lamb & Rice"" I got ""Happy Dog Sensible New Zealand Lamb"" I don't have an old bag anymore to compare the ingredients. The new bag contains rice flour as an ingredient. Are the ingredients 100% the same? Has only the packaging and description changed? Until this is clarified I give only 2 stars",2
1884,All good except for the annoying hum,2
1885,Got the same via Wish from China. Exactly the same device with the same lousy display. If it is on the table you can see nothing. You have to tilt it until the angle is right. Function: Thermometer into the meat - cable through the oven door to the stand of the thermometer. This can then be taken 3-5 meters into another room (max!) And then it beeps when the temp. is achieved. Temp. Accuracy is good. But the display... subterranean.,2
1886,"I still know the game from before. The game idea is great. But the current implementation is very frustrating. The construction takes forever and is impossible for small children to carry out alone. The ramp for the ball is a great idea, but unfortunately the balls hook in almost every round, which disturbs the further course. Poor implementation at the moment.",2
1887,"This jacket is very filigree and poorly processed, crooked cut and threads hang out. In addition, it is extremely small cut.",2
1888,"Unfortunately expires, despite tight tightening.",2
1889,"Well packed, the LED strip arrived today. Unfortunately, he went back immediately after assembly. Already during the assembly there were difficulties with the adhesive film, this unfortunately went off when removing the protective strip partly already with the LED strip. I then mounted them provisionally with the remaining adhesive strip. This strip also gave me the impression that it has not been processed well. The functional test then turned out that some of the colors were not reproduced correctly. With the color white, for example, red, green and blue etc. Had already bought several LED strips with which I am very satisfied. But this one is deficient. Maybe it was only this one - still no purchase recommendation from me. I have now ordered the Osram LED strip",2
1890,"The delivery was quick, however the wrong size was delivered and the fabric wraps crooked....",2
1891,"I've already swapped dozens of displays on Iphones... With this one, the accessories and the packaging fit, but the display is much darker than the original and has a bright spot! (In the picture at the bottom right you can see skipping the song.) This does not get bigger even with pressure but remains the same and therefore did not arise on my part. (If something was in the way behind the display, then the location would change under load) Otherwise, it works...",2
1892,Lasted just under a year. Now I prefer to ride with a slightly hanging chain without a tensioner.,2
1893,"It does not always work round, in addition there are noises when listening to music. It only works if you also load it.",2
1894,Delivery no later than 30 April. Now we are the 3rd of May and received no delivery and no other information. That's bad,2
1895,For 5 XL ... much too small,2
1896,"I didn't expect too much, but the functionality is quite limited. The first connection with the smartphone was very unstable but then it worked. SMS and WhatsApp leave a message. But then read on the smartphone. The voice quality is, how to formulate it? Really bad!!!! All in all, a toy with no added value. The device is also not a replacement for a smartphone or a mobile phone. Definitely no recommendation",2
1897,"Reads like a book for children, especially at the end, with a ridiculous ending without esprit or surprise and naïve",2
1898,"The fabric is comfortable on the skin, but unfortunately the scarf looks very cheap. Due to the many positive comments, I got involved in the price-performance ratio, but was disappointed.",2
1899,Unfortunately had good expectations for the money unfortunately the right shoe is poorly processed the shoe sole not properly glued in the middle,2
1900,"I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint in a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I have applied the product twice. The first time I noticed directly that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out a chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions even with not satisfied result. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like the first attempt. What was the worst of all, it still stunk weeks after application. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn't go away.",2
1901,"I am not very satisfied with the lights because one side does not really glow yellow and a small part was broken off. But for 6,99€ I did not expect much more.",2
1902,"Unfortunately, even this film cannot be applied absolutely bubble-free and has a negative influence on the color reproduction. So it remains without foil.",2
1903,"Works well but the flash rotates, does not remain firmly on the lens. Batteries have to be bought separately.... Not so the roar",2
1904,"Actually, I was satisfied with the film, it fits perfectly and the colors of the display are not distorted. Everything looks very clear, as if there is no foil on it. Also the touch screen is not affected in my opinion. After a day I noticed that the right side of the foil did not stick properly. It crackles when you press on it and after a short time the dust also collected underneath. Today my mobile phone fell down and the foil came off completely. The mobile phone was therefore unprotected in the fall. Both survived it, but the foil is now splintered at the bottom right. Very annoying, because so the film does not fulfill its purpose if it comes off when it falls.",2
1905,Item is not suitable for the honor 10. The disc that was delivered may fit for another mobile phone but when I order a foil I do not assume that at least on each side over half a centimeter is free. That's way too much,2
1906,"Unfortunately, it is not much good for fabric",2
1907,"iPhone is very well protected in this case, so that's it. UNFORTUNATELY, the back only looks nice if it is not touched! Unfortunately quite difficult when you hold the mobile phone in your hand. You can see every fingerprint on this case! Already after a short time it looks really disgusting and looks bacon! really a pity !!!!",2
1908,"Beautiful in the picture, bad in everyday life. The ceiling has uneven meshes (normal for manual work), in addition to the fact that the material fluffs very much, I was able to send both blankets back without any problems. Big plus and a huge thank you for that.",2
1909,"As already written by many predecessors, the tarpaulin does not hold at all at the 4 corners of the pool. Since the tarpaulin is supposed to be exactly for our Bestway pool in size, I had ordered it despite the negative remarks here - once and never again! Too bad for the money",2
1910,Usable as cheap steak knives. Processing is rather poor. Immediately recognizable as a bad copy.,2
1911,"Certainly, the error sits in front of the product, but despite time, patience, study of the instructions for use and sufficient equipment, I simply did not manage it. The result is wavy, detaches at the ends. ... Next autumn I will have the large window area of my old apartment insulated with a professional film to save energy and protect the environment.",2
1912,Really a cheap product. The fabric can be easily cut / torn even with a small blunt scissors.,2
1913,A cheap product made in China. Didn't live up to expectations. What a pity...,2
1914,"Unfortunately, the pressure is not nice at all. Too bad, I was very much looking forward to the cup. Size is fine.",2
1915,"My friend thought it would be great for the cats, but unfortunately the cats don't like the smell of. Therefore not from the manufacturer but from us a bad purchase",2
1916,The battery status LEDs remain on even when the lamp is off. This interferes and after a few hours the battery is empty.,2

1918,"The plastic is harder not as soft as it used to be, whether the originals are???",2
1919,Zippo was scratched and not in good condition. Only the shell was fine,2
1920,"Unfortunately, it doesn't bring me much personally. I can hardly find any pain relief. But the workmanship is absolutely top",2
1921,"for the price ok, but real quality should not be expected",2
1922,"After inflating my son's football once, the needle looks like this. Hangs loosely in the holder. I hope the others hold up better. Otherwise, I will have to complain about the needles and correct my rating downwards...",2
1923,"Hello, unfortunately I can hardly report any positive things about the slide. The advantages of a glass film / armored film should be known to everyone, in this respect the film here also keeps what it promises. When it comes to privacy, it fails all along the line! You can see and read everything from almost all angles. Absolutely unclear to me why Amazon does not take action against the obvious fake reviews. As you can see in my photos, the function as a glass foil it passed great! My iPhone once fell from the kitchen top onto the tiled floor. Foil has a crack, iPhone display has remained intact :) Greetings",2
1924,"After unfortunately already two months, the headphones are broken on one side, nothing happens anymore. Is the page with the volume buttons, maybe there is a weak point here.",2
1925,The touch screen is very heavy. Had promised me more of it.,2
1926,Unfortunately I had to send it back as the size didn't fit at all. Had ordered the dirndl extra a little bigger and still it was much too tight. Otherwise it is very nice. Have now ordered me a size larger. Hope that it fits then.,2
1927,"Unfortunately, they are not well sewn. three out of four pillows were crooked Already disposed of unfortunately, but return shipping etc. would not be worth believing",2
1928,"The lever is already broken off the first use, the gliders are ok.",2
1929,"The J7 DUO is a mobile phone with many good features. However, it has a big disadvantage: Here only cheap display glass was installed, which already scratches with careful use. Slight shocks are immediately acknowledged with breakouts. The J7 DUO would receive a 5 star rating from me if gorilla glass had been processed here. So it will probably have been my last Samsung (after 2 previous models), TOO BAD.",2
1930,Small crack in the shell and shell somewhat broken. CD was undamaged.,2
1931,"In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very simple, and the radio range is also very good, but there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, here plausible values are still displayed. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because it always shows completely astronomical values of the outdoor humidity. This is a pity, because the device was placed on the outside in a protected place and also the reason why I only give this product two stars.",2
1932,"Delivered in the wrong color. Silver was ordered, white was delivered. Performance is good. Device is very noisy. Sleeping in the same room is not possible. Timer settings are minimal: only turn off after x hours or turn on after x hours.",2
1933,"Due to the good reviews, I was tempted to buy a cheaper fitted sheet for our waterbed. Unfortunately, I can not understand the good reviews. The fabric is unpleasant and totally slippery in the morning - I think who has ever had a good fitted sheet (80€) for a waterbed, will not be satisfied with this",2
1934,"I had the Mop sent to me a good year and a half ago. After only a few weeks, the stem could only be locked sporadically. In the meantime, nothing works anymore and the warranty has expired. Too bad, because in principle this mop is good. Vllt. I was also just unlucky and caught a Monday model ...",2
1935,"Unfortunately, this protective film does not adhere to the entire display, see photo. In terms of price, it was fine for me before ordering because there were 3 protective films in the package.",2
1936,"In itself, the cable looks really great. Only I ordered one black and one rose, I got 2 rose. My friend thanked me...",2

1938,"Unfortunately, our stubenwagen does not fit",2
1939,Not really waterproof and quite unstable but okay for the price.,2
1940,"Plate looks quite pretty and is not too expensive. However, the plate wobbled even before the first use on the stove. With induction not quite as bad, however, I would have imagined it differently.",2
1941,"Delivery was fast and ring looked great. Unfortunately, the ring is no good. At the 2 look A lot of me on the already what was broken off and when trying on the ring that broke even further. My daughter was very sad.",2

1954,"It all arrived well packed and making dan on it was also pretty easy... However, the glass is somehow a little too small for the display... On the left right is missing a little bit to the end of the device and on the left unfortunately also so much that it is when watching the video or similar. Already disturbing! Unfortunately I am not so satisfied...",2

1957,"I bought the product for my friend as he is a big BMW fan. On the first impression he looked very good. Unfortunately, it no longer works after being used twice. The holder leaks and the chip no longer holds, after 4 weeks it can be thrown away again. Very unfortunate. On a request of the return, it was only communicated that there is no guarantee. Therefore, no purchase recommendation!",2
1958,I'm not so excited. Colors don't last long,2
1959,"The workmanship seems to be quite good (housing made of hard plastic), I just do not like that you paralyze the entire can with the on/off switches. I thought the switch is just for the USB bar... because the cables draw power even when no device is connected... Too bad actually. I gave the can away...",2
1960,The projector did not meet my expectations. If you take the projector to illuminate a very small area it is ok but as soon as the area is larger and you have to move it further away everything is totally blurred and of poor image quality.,2
1961,"The cube for the sound effects makes a real spectacle when it hangs on the charging cable, but does not work at all after inserting it in the Transformers. Therefore, all in all, only acceptable due to the greatly reduced price. Since my grandson did not want to give up the part again, he remains without a usable cube even if I find it really annoying to keep a not 100 percent part.",2

1966,"Compared to the tape I had before, the first touch makes it noticeable that the fabric is thinner and softer. What could have been an advantage, however, turned out to be a disadvantage already at the first use: the fabric travels, gives way, tatters - gives up completely after a short playing time. In addition, the glue stops sticking as soon as you start to sweat even slightly. Too bad - as a sports tape it is not so usable.",2
1967,Defective after exactly 1 year. What a pity. Was used in the nursery. Light emitted warm light. No buzzing or flickering.,2

1975,Useless. Have not been able to perceive any changes.,2
1976,"Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the machine, as it arrived defective. It was only in the box without outer packaging.Which surprised me very much. Then she was wet from the inside. What a pity",2

1978,"Unfortunately, the snowsuit is cut very unfavorably. So that you can hardly use it in the small sizes, since only the top can be opened. In addition, I put the size 62 on our jumpsuit of another brand in size 56. The overall in 62 is much smaller.",2
1979,"Unfortunately, this shovel quickly broke.",2
1980,"Unfortunately already defective after less than 3 months. Very unstable housing - removal of the LAN cable is virtually impossible without pulling out the inner workings. And now, after two and a half months, it unfortunately no longer does what it is supposed to do - transmit the Internet. What a pity! Update: Contact with the seller went smoothly, a new device is delivered immediately. It remains to be seen how long it will work.",2
1981,"The delivery was fast and the item well packed. He also made a fairly stable impression. Only the amount that can be prepared in it was clearly too little for us, so the snacking effort decreased.",2
1982,"So the so advertised bass is not available, well what do you want to expect with the size. But what bothered me more. 1. No radio station can be obtained without immense noise. Or he can't find one at all. Does not save the found radio station either. Each time you can search anew. 2. When you change modes, a woman's voice yells at you at a volume where the neighbors definitely have something of it. Went back immediately",2
1983,"Got pimples from it. However, the skin feels very soft afterwards. I guess it's because of my sensitive skin that the product causes this reaction in me.",2

1985,A solar dummy camera is broken.,2

1988,"I wanted a kettle that boils water. So far so good. That's what he does. Therefore already 2 stars. Unfortunately, the lid rattles all the time when heating, which itself is very loud and also the filling is a challenge if the lid constantly falls shut. Go back.",2
1989,"After I wrote a supper review, totz the bad stench, I understood that the shell has more quirks than I thought. That's where the new rating comes from! It is not anti-scratch at all. I found 2 small holes in the middle of the case which means it is not safe at all for my Macbook. Very very unfortunate, it looks so good and also fits supper for the Mac, I was so enthusiastic about the case, unfortunately the quality is not as described. by the way, the smell is still not gone after 5 days :(",2
1990,"Unfortunately I could never use them because the first one was completely divided, the second was glued to the back plate and the third threw folds ... The material itself was really good and made me so happy.... Now my phone has no protection and I have to order a new one ....",2
1991,"Bought this headset solely for the microphone, as I have high quality headphones and I have this headset around to use the microphone. I've had several ""cheap headsets"" over the years that I've used in the same way, and while this one is at least stable (some others don't), the microphone is the worst I've experienced in all these years. The microphone is too quiet even if you set it to 100% both in the audio driver and in the program used. If you set the speech activation moderately, it does not absorb quieter spoken words, for example at the beginning and end of sentences. If you adjust the voice activation more aggressively, the keyboard (a normal rubber dome, i.e. no mechanical keyboard) is also activated every time the keys are pressed. You have to keep in mind that the microphone is almost in my mouth, but the keyboard is certainly 40cm away. There is therefore no optimal setting that could ensure a satisfactory voice recording. In the end, two stars for stability, but nothing more, because the edges of the plastic are sharp, the pop protection falls down far too easily and the functionality is no good.",2
1992,"Visually a very nice cover. But you can see all the fingerprints in the back. After 3 months of use, it has already broken and has many scratches. Very unfortunate",2
1993,At first great but after 2 months of use again and again interruption of the music playback,2

1995,"Unfortunately, I used the mouse for less than a month until it broke. At first I found the mouse to be very comfortable in the hand, also small and practical for on the go. Only the USB plug wobbled a little. In use, the mouse also worked absolutely flawlessly and impeccably, I was convinced that I had made a real bargain. If the mouse had not suddenly passed on no signal to the laptop for unknown reasons, it would be 5 stars due to the fast and disappointing defect therefore only 2. If the product works longer, it is certainly a good choice, but I will now buy a more durable model.",2
1996,"Well for the price quite ok, unfortunately can not do much with it & the plucking really hurts...",2
1997,"I have probably let myself be dazzled by the sometimes exuberant reviews. First of all, I would like to say that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Due to the fact that I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. At Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for less than 30 EUR, you can not say that. But that it can keep up (as written in many reviews) with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, that's just not true! I really hoped that it would be, but there really can be no question of that. The upholstered walls are much thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more labbrige. Overall, the feel of this backpack is not comparable to that of my Lowepro. Also the zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not exactly of high quality. That's why I decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment of many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to take the money for a reasonable backpack in my hand. Quality seems to have its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that he was going back. What I liked is the color inside. Here you will certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine goes back.",2
1998,Yes it dissolves very badly in hot water otherwise it actually tastes good.,2
1999,"Attention the two are tiny. Height fits so reasonably. Drawers correspondingly small. Due to lack of replacement, we have kept you.",2
2000,"The fabric is very thin and floppy and much too short, the right leg is a bit shorter",3
2001,"Sticker works well. However, it is not very stable. It lasts about a week, then the first jump is in it. However, this happens to me with every glass. Could not yet find a manufacturer where this does not happen.",3
2002,"What do you want to say is a cap, the Velcro fastener to adjust the size. Cap also looks out as in the picture.",3
2003,"For my purposes, the camping chair was just too small (low) and too unstable. It has the great advantage that it is incredibly light, the seating comfort is also given. However, you should not be too fat for that. Really great to take away, as it comes in a practical bag, which can later also be used as a stuff holder. However, the chair was too low for me and it wobbled back and forth too much. In addition, a rubber foot was so loose that it would have been lost immediately. That's why I sent it back.",3
2004,A bit violent. Too crass for me. But nice in itself,3
2005,"I am not 100% convinced. The patches take forever to dry and are then rock hard... The result is only medium satisfactory... There are better patches. I advise against the black patches... the black smearing on the skin and on the fingers can really be saved. If my review has helped you with your purchase decision, I would be very happy if you would confirm this. Thank you very much.",3
2006,"The gel is certainly not bad for gingivitis. Unfortunately, I think the tube is a disaster, because often far too much comes out, which is annoying with the small amount that is contained. If the tube is no longer quite as full, it is difficult to get anything out at all, which leads to the fact that you press too hard and immediately come back too much. The tube or its material is therefore certainly in urgent need of improvement.",3
2007,"In itself, the brush is not bad but because it has a flexible part at the front, you do not necessarily get into every corner. I previously had an identical brush only with a rigid handle and found this brush 100 times better.",3
2008,"The bed linen is quite cuddly but different, as indicated, it was stated on the packaging that the bed linen was only washable at 40°. In addition, after the third cover, the zipper of the duvet has said goodbye. Very unfortunate and maybe only an isolated case.",3

With 2 cable holders, the rubber holder has already detached from the adhesive pad below the rubber holder within 1 week and the cables were back on the bode. After almost 3 months I have already glued 13 pieces (although I only needed 5) because some (different) came loose again and again. only a holder holds for 3 months without problems the adhesive pads hold by the way great and are not so easy to detach (e.B. from the desk) if necessary, this adhesive intensity would also have helped the rubberized side very much",3

After three weeks it finally came and I wanted to insert the batteries that I already had ready at home. But what a surprise, batteries in it, but nothing is with Red Dot... There is no connection between the battery compartment and the battery cover, ergo no current flows. Great thing, I tried to make a connection with a bit of copper wire but that was just a waste of time... So from me is no purchase recommendation to pronounce here.

Especially the white one scratches on the paper, and somehow writes so 'thin', hope you understand what I mean. The golden one still writes most pleasantly. But what really bothers me even more is that you have to put down more often between writing, because the pen no longer writes, and on another sheet you have to scribble something so that the color runs again. I think it's a pity because I'm going to write a few things that HAVE to look really good, and so you can actually lose the desire to write.

2132,"I was looking for a headlamp that is versatile, has a good quality and is as cheap as possible. Of course, you can't avoid a Ledlenser. After my long research, however, I ordered a Petzl Tikka for comparison. Unfortunately, I have to say, the Ledlenser had the disadvantage and went back. The decisive point for me was the illuminated area and the color of the light. The Ledlenser only illuminates a circular spot and the light is very cold white. The Tikka, on the other hand, illuminates a wider area and has a warmer pleasant light. Personally, I find the latter, especially with prolonged use in the closer field of view (e.B. camping), as not so exhausting for the eye. Of course, it also depends on the area of application and others attach more importance to the wearing comfort or the light range, if the lamp is used e.B. Mainly for jogging. In this regard, I consider both lamps to be very comfortable to wear. Both also hold very well and shine very far. For some, the adjustable focus of the Ledlenser may be an advantage that can certainly be useful in some areas of application. The Tikka has more settings and can also glow red or flash. In terms of wearing comfort, you could classify the Ledlenser a little ahead of the Tikka, as the lamp is well balanced by the rear-offset battery compartment. The workmanship of the Ledlenser is, as usual, very good. In summary: + very bright + brightness infinitely adjustable + focusable + good wearing comfort and balanced - very cold white light - area of illumination, only a circular spot",3

When detecting movements indoors through an object, the lamp had dropouts with me. Sometimes it worked - sometimes it didn't. The sensor for the brightness is missing? Of course, it is not in the offer text. This means that the lamp always switches day and night when something moves. If you can read, you have a clear advantage here.

The texts, on the other hand, are very suitable for everyday use and the vocabulary of each lesson is listed alphabetically at the end, so that you really get a quick and good overview.

Before buying, I was slightly unsure whether I would get 3 pairs or only 1 pair for the price. As always, the package arrived very quickly via Amazon Prime and took only one day together with other products. The pair of socks came wrapped in a plastic wrap and did not make a particularly high-quality impression from the packaging. When I unpacked the pair of socks, I was surprised that I only get a pair of socks for 7.98 €, I find this very expensive, even if they are good sports socks. The socks feel like polyester, which is very often used in sportswear. After repeated use during sports and continuous strain, I have to say that the socks already feel comfortable and also absorb the moisture well. The feet feel protected and you have more stability in the bones. This is definitely a big advantage to conventional socks, which also break quickly. The socks also make a stable impression of the material and do not tear after a short use. Conclusion: The socks feel good and are definitely good for sports, but I think that a pair for 7.98 € is completely overpriced.",3

""Pay 6 - get 4"" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have settled this accommodating and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for two star deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly illuminated. The light color is more in the direction of cold white. Perfect for hallway, study, workshop, laundry room etc. For living spaces, I would personally resort to warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb.

Conclusion: Print quality> is comparable to a more expensive variant - setup> Thanks to WIN 10 and W-Lan child's play - lifetime> bought in 2014, we print through the hobby closer (woman) a lot with the black cartridge, but also pictures in colorful had to be often by the children. Now the feeding of the leaves no longer works :-( and we need a new one! We opt for the same HP again, because we still have cartridges left ;-)",3

2225,"Stands too far from the window and can therefore not darken enough. The thermal effect, well. I also have roller blinds without the coating. Get just as hot when the sun is on it. Also squeaks unfortunately always when up and down. The brackets are okay and also designed for thick frames. Value for money is okay.",3
2226,"Changing the lock was very easy. Everything fit well. Unfortunately, the key goes in and out a bit awkwardly. Have already lubricated it. Hope it gets a little smoother over time.",3
2227,"+ It works on iPhone and iPad and does what it should - But what it does, it usually does with a response delay, which is very annoying e.B. when painting. After a week of trying, I give up, because this delay is just annoying... whether playing games or just operating the iPhone... Update: The original Apple Pencil had to be... and what can I say: All TipTop... the price, at least for this piece of HW, seems justified...",3

2231,"the device has just arrived and I had to realize that the packaging is very much shredded and the contents have fallen towards me,,,,,",3
2232,"The pacifier chain is good. The thing that bothers me, however, is the fact that the chain is quite stiff and not very mobile, which I find impractical for my baby, who also uses the chain for playing.",3
2233,Okay; unfortunately always slips up when jogging. For the price but fully in order.,3
2234,"Unfortunately, the suction feet also hold on polished paint and despite moistening only very unreliable. I probably won't entrust my ActionCam to this part for fear of loss",3

After only 2 long-distance trips with transfers, however, the holder of the first band is unfortunately already broken.

2249,"In general, the pans are not bad. The ingredients are well fried or cooked. The time it takes for the pans to reach a good temperature is relatively long. However, this can also be due to my stove. Little fat/oil is needed, which is also great. However, if you do not have a single household, you should refrain from buying these pans. The diameter of the pans is really small and you quickly reach the limits of the capacity. What is to be criticized, however, is the fact that after only 3 times of use of the grill pan, the coating dissolves, although I followed the manufacturer's instructions.... really bad. Conclusion: Pans are quite okay, but I can neither recommend them, nor would I buy them again. So everyone has to decide for themselves 😉",3
2250,"Still average in terms of taste, but not pleasant in terms of smell. Unfortunately the worst coffee we have had in the office so far.",3
2251,"Seems to be a super product for the price. Unfortunately received a return. The part was pressed with force into the original box. Instructions for installation and connection were missing. Screws were included, but packed in a freezer bag. At a price of 16,80 € you can close both eyes. But the already not easy connection was only possible after Internet research.",3

With filters and housings, it takes great pictures even in deep water! We are super satisfied! Unfortunately, my camera had an error and became incredibly hot when charging. But after contacting Amazon, I was sent a new one right away. Really great!! Really only recommended :) UPDATE: Hadn't tried the new one yet and wanted to take it on vacation now. But also with the camera again exactly the same. It gets incredibly hot when charging and then doesn't go on anymore. Too bad!",3
2258,"I wore the toe spreaders most of the day. Unfortunately, even after several days, I did not notice any improvement/pain relief. Disposed of them. The material is ""wobbly"" and magically attracts lint. They were easy to wear and only bothered me a bit at first until I got used to it.",3
2259,"Beautiful cover. Great design. The protective function also seems to be fulfilled. However, especially the jack output is very difficult to reach (cable with thin plug / head necessary)",3
2260,"Delivery was fast and packaging very professional. Only, as already mentioned, the suction power is weaker and the device heavier than the original. But for this price I will keep it for the time being",3

You should expect a set-up time of 2.5 hours. A little more glue in the chipboard would be quite good, because then the screws would hold a little better. Certainly there are better but also more expensive ones. On the whole, I am satisfied.",3
2275,Windows still fog up,3
2276,The compartments are great! Perfect for university or for swimming! But the back part is not really stable if you do not pack the backpack cleanly it presses. So nothing for hiking!!!,3
2277,"Actually, the skirt is very beautiful. I am 1.80 m tall and carry size 42. I ordered it in 44/46. But I think it's way too big. Order me probably even smaller. Unfortunately, I had to pay the shipping costs for the return.",3

2279,"The cabinet is as far as the price, so the materials are not the best. However, the drawer is so cheap and rickety that a higher rating is not possible. The cabinet smells a bit unpleasant and the dark paint of the work surface is not resistant to alcohol. Some screws spin during assembly. The bottom line is that there are better cabinets for the price. Luckily, this one probably won't last long and I can buy something better.",3

2281,"I bought the carpets in black, they are super soft, very pleasant for the feet and visually very beautiful and noble, unfortunately you can really see every dust grain or hair on the black color, if you do not necessarily vacuum every day. Unfortunately, they also slip through the whole bathroom which is annoying. If then I would buy them in gray.",3

With the lock this is also possible?! Potential was definitely wasted. Nevertheless, we kept them because we collect the small band of explorers.",3
2286,"We and my grandson liked the jacket very much. Unfortunately, the bags have not been described enough and are not lockable. The zippers you see are just for decoration. and the pockets themselves on the right and left are slanted and without closure. Unfortunately, not very deep either. An inside pocket is also not available. At this age of 10 to 13 years, every child today carries a mobile phone and a ticket with him and needs corresponding pockets, which should be zippered. Manufacturers urgently need to adapt to this. Very unfortunate, because the quality of this jacket I would rate with very good. The size 170 would have suited a 12-year-old tall child well. Above all, it was not cut as wide, but long and narrow as boys of that age are. Now I had to send them back because of the unsatisfactory bags. The return worked great with the QR code and the drop-off in the Hermes parcel shop. The next day the money was back in my account - PERFECT.",3
2287,As packaging for a gift in order. Price/performance rather unsatisfactory. Content is very manageable,3

2298,"The chair is well made, can be easily opened and folded and makes a stable impression. However, it is not very comfortable, as the bar presses on the thighs despite already good padding.

2299,The bicycle trailer is stable and quickly assembled. The disadvantage: The drawbar is too short to hang the bicycle trailer behind a 28 wheel. With our 4 wheels it did not fit anyway. But with a little tinkering and an extension pipe we extended the drawbar and now it's going great.,3

In addition, I find it a bit too expensive for that.",3

I found the content to be a beautiful story, and I also liked the individual characters. Unfortunately, I did not award more stars because the book slowed me down in my reading flow. On the one hand, the long chapters bothered me. I often caught myself counting the pages to the end of the chapter. On the other hand, there was no real tension for me, through which I would have devoured the book without a break. Therefore, here again my conclusion: Beautiful story, but still expandable.",3

I was not told that the blanket has different dimensions, it was simply sent to me incorrectly and I used it and wondered. Then I measured it and found that it is only 200 cm long.

Also, the color is a bit dark and definitely not suitable for very light skin types. My skin is relatively light and I have very dark circles under my eyes, which covered it well, but a shade of lighter color would definitely have been better.

Furthermore, the lid does not close nicely with the frame of the AP can (air gap). The strain relief for the CAT6 cable is a bit too large for the cable diameter of standard cables with plugs cannot be clamped properly here. And what was very annoying is that the fastening screw the lid could not be screwed in. The thread in the metal can was probably not cleanly deburred, or too small for the screw. On a mounting height of 30cm is the ne fummlige affair which certainly took 10 minutes.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the app. The different fireplaces are still good. But the menu and the menu navigation clearly need to be improved. The operation of the menu via the remote control of my Amazon Fire TV stick is simply weak. Also, the app reacts to the settings quite sluggishly. I was also hoping that I could at least put my Amazon Prime Music under the fireplace somehow, but that doesn't work either. You are dependent on the music in the app. That's why my conclusion: For a paid app, Virtual Fireplace simply offers me too little, especially because it should still be optimized for Amazon Fire TV. That's why I only give it 3 stars. There are free log fire apps that are comparatively even better.",3

The white container can be separated from the red holder. A handle for carrying is available. If the canister is full, however, it is very difficult to carry. Hence a point deduction. Two handles would be better. Another point deduction, since the canister is not tight. There is a closure at the outlet of the container. Nevertheless, water drips out. The easiest way is to fill the container with a watering can or a hose. Everything else just gives a mess or is too heavy. Once the potions are filled in place, they serve their purpose.

It has 2 extra attachments, i.e. nose and hair clipper. 2. It's cheap. Usually, the good electric shavers, which are supplied with at least 2 separate attachments, cost about 50 euros. This is certainly cheaper. 3. It weighs less than the previous 2 electric shavers I have used in the past. 4. The battery charges quickly and lasts a long time. Negative points: 1. The electric motor is not as powerful and affects the performance of the shaver. I have found that it takes 3 passes to cut the hair that other razors (Panasonic and s.w.) would take for cutting once. 2. The power button is in a bad position. The device is incorrectly turned off with a single pressure of finger or hand during use. 3. The head of the hair clipper is very small, so it does not cover a large area during use. The downside is that it requires several passes to completely cleanse the skin area. Conclusion: While I'm using it for now, I'm not completely satisfied with this purchase. The main thing I don't like about this product is its performance. With a more powerful engine, this could have been a great device.",3

2534,"At the price it was clear to me that these are not high-quality glue clamps for corner connections - they cost a whole corner more. For my applications, however, the things as holders are completely sufficient. Actually, it should also be quite easy to hold two strips in order to glue/screw/nail them. Far from it, due to the very short angles of the clamp (about 1cm high), the clamp likes to slide down again and it gets a lot fiddly, because even the retaining screws are not easy to turn off if you only have two hands. After the eighth corner, however, I slowly had the bow out (just lay out everything on the floor and then connect it) and now I like to take the clamps here.",3
2535,"When opening the packaging, the ""labeling"" of the device came to me separately. When trying to re-attach the crumpled sticker, it turned out that this sticker does not fit the frame of the screen (too short). Since the sticker also shows the info where the voltage source and the load are connected, the whole thing becomes a small guessing game. The voltage source is connected on the side with the additional plug. Function as far as given. Display is very easy to read. But the detachment of the inscription should have been noticed by the manufacturer when packaging.",3
2536,"Super fast delivery. Unfortunately does not correspond to the size XL. I would have liked the product very much, unfortunately much too small.",3
2537,For the price quite okey,3
2538,"Attention. The light is not dimmable and the color temperature setting is not saved. The lamp looks nice, but the fan is not really quiet. Very easy installation but modestly described remote control...... The light is very bright. If the description of the item were correct, the seller could expect better reviews. So only 3 out of 5 stars as it is not what I ordered.",3
2539,"The book is very lovingly designed, the illustrations cute. However, I was hoping for more in terms of content. From the point of view of an educator, it is rather sobering according to the description. The language is rather 'schmaltzy' - too little colloquial. Then I'm a little sad that the focus is more on the friends wanting to hide their flaws instead of resolving the conflict. Simply excluding the 'evil' magpie at the end, instead of showing solutions on how to get out of her frustration and get closer to the group again, is illogical. In principle, the same thing is done to her as she herself has incined - exclude, because she is different. Otherwise, everyone from a group can identify with a character. Only one solution is left. What a pity!",3
2540,"Unfortunately I had red eye edges after 3 days of use and when making eyes it burned. Something always stuck to my eyelashes and ran into my eye. Maybe I was just too stupid when applying. Therefore, unfortunately, I can not say what the result is. now try the other eyelash serum from eyecatcha, because I trust the brand. Definitely no hormones in it. and that's very important to me. Have applied the other eyelash serum from eyecatcher today for the first time and from the consistency I find it better. Nothing runs down and nothing sticks to the eyelashes. I hope I can tolerate that.",3
2541,"Small and cute. In terms of taste, there is nothing to complain about. I bought them as a gift, but I tested them beforehand. Filling - in my opinion - a bit cumbersome. Nevertheless, I do not find these vapors bad for occasional steamers. But unfortunately I have to contradict the product description. And the battery does not last nearly as long as described. And I didn't use them permanently or anything else. After about 70-100 puffs, the battery is empty. That is simply not enough for me, as a vaper. That's why only 3 stars.",3

2543,"Great lamp, looks valuable and in itself also well processed. BUT: Lampshades are of different sizes. Wanted to hang 3 lamps next to each other. With one of the lamps, the height of the shade was about 1 cm lower than with the others. This is striking. So ordered again, itself effect. With the next lamp, the difference was minimal. Here, improvements can be made in production.",3

2553,"Ordered the flap for my roof extension. The delivery time was very good but unfortunately the flap arrived defective. It is connected at the outer corners with 4 pop rivets. Unfortunately, the rivets at one of the corners were not processed cleanly and the two edges were therefore not processed together. As a result, a corner was not connected. But since I urgently needed the flap and could not continue without it, I had to repair it first. So drill out the pop rivets and connect the whole thing sensibly with new rivets. Was not so planned but could not be otherwise. Therefore only 3 stars. Otherwise, the flap is very good. Can be easily inserted into a plasterboard (provided you have measured and cut correctly). Opens and closes easily. So definitely recommended.",3
2554,"When I learned that there should be the vintage caskets from back then, with which I liked to play as a child, I wanted to order a casket for my daughter as well. Unfortunately, it no longer comes close to the quality of that time. It is not very valuable. The legs of the figures are made of soft rubber. These are glued to various places in the casket like suction cups so that the figures can stand. After two days, however, they no longer stuck. The hinged staircase breaks off again and again after a short time and must be reattached. My daughter's enthusiasm was therefore limited. Originally, I had also ordered 3 more caskets, which are only available in October. However, I have now cancelled them again, as I expected more in the end. What a pity!",3
2555,"We have been using the fuses for half a year. At the beginning I was absolutely thrilled, due to the mechanism with the magnet, the children can not clamp themselves. In the meantime, however, our son (1 1/2) has already broken four of the fuses by trying to open the secured drawers. I think a parental control should withstand the power of a toddler. I would not buy this product again.",3

2576,"Nice decorative item, unfortunately the suction cups do not hold really well and the led light floats on as soon as air is pumped in. Another point: The lamp also reacts to pretty much every remote control in the household (TV, Blu-ray player, etc.) and seemingly indiscriminately switches the operating mode or colors. Would therefore have to hide the receiver in the cabinet and can only operate the lamp when the cabinet door is open. Update: the LED lamp did not last a total of 2 months, first the colors were wrong, then nothing worked. On closer inspection, it was easy to see how the sealing compound or resin got fine cracks and the water could penetrate.",3

Recording videos is also possible, but not sending. There is only a green picture with sound! Some calls are difficult to answer. You type your way through the surfaces until the listener appears at some point. The battery performance also leaves much to be desired.

After I left them open for the night, the smell is relatively well warped. The blowing up of the balloons went without problems, some we filled with gas, just blown up. That was no problem at all, but unfortunately the confetti did not hold on to the plastic, which I found very unfortunate, but so the children at least had something to do. Basically, I would order the balloons again, as they were delivered very quickly and still looked nice, but unfortunately I deduct a point for the appearance and half a point each because of the confetti and the plastic smell.",3

The other plug is only there for charging any devices and thus relatively useless. I didn't know that when I made the purchase, which is why I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a disgraceful extension, I would certainly not have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgement, the extension fulfills its service very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the plugged in USB stick does not just dangle around in the area, as with a normal extension cord. So no real bad buy, but my euphoria is kept within narrow limits :-).",3

No button to press, so the product had to be defective. So written directly with the seller and without any circumstances a replacement product was sent to me directly.

On the whole, I think the product is great, but the circumstances that I first got a defective product, which then loses its taste relatively quickly and is empty after a maximum of 200 puffs and that for 13 €, do not allow me to rate the goods well.",3
2673,For the price I would have expected more. But it's fine.,3
2674,"I read all of Nele Neuhaus's books with enthusiasm. But this thriller disappointed me. At the beginning he is very long-winded. I was really bored while reading. In addition, many people, so that it is easy to lose track. Only towards the middle it gets more exciting and at the end you are rewarded. As always, it develops into a captivating thriller!",3
2675,The blade quickly becomes dull and angular,3
2676,"I don't know how all this good rating comes about. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you get from every optician in a slightly smaller form gift. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I have promised myself much more of these cloths it is also really very very thin. Since I used it I can unfortunately no longer exchange it I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far overdrawn more than 2 euros you should not give.",3
2677,A bit small.... would have thought that would be bigger.... A baby's foot fits in... But otherwise it was ok,3
2678,I had thought that there were more pictures in it. But it's a lot of text. Just everything exactly bullet point-like. The book is okay.,3
2679,"Actually, it is exactly as described. But it is not thought through. Anyone could plug in the book.",3
2680,Good fit Unfortunately wrong size delivered XL ordered L delivered,3
2681,"A little too none, better order 1-2 sizes larger... Quality otherwise great, just to recommend!!!!",3
2682,Is not so good because the feces stick to the butt,3
2683,Unfortunately not such good quality. You look through from the outside despite mirroring and she immediately had a small quirk on the mirroring. Minimal but you can see it. For driving it is enough for me bet I unfortunately expected more according to the customer reviews.,3
2684,Price performance ok but unfortunately the pictures are never 100 sharp,3
2685,"Super great hangers. ~Space-saving ~super design, color :) ~cheap ~fast shipping Many positive features but not recommended Real nasty smell with smoked salmon for comparison, this smell just does not go away:( really a pity .....",3
2686,"A ring is difficult to close. At the top, the closure has bent slightly. But they look good and don't look cheap.",3
2687,"Actually, shoes fit me in 39.5 but even a 41 does not fit me in the shoes. In terms of length, however, they fit they are super narrow cut. Otherwise, they look up like in the picture.",3
2688,One or the other button was broken. Had to glue them with superglue. The screws are too long!,3
2689,"After 2 years (economical use) the power button no longer works. It is only possible if you bring the slider for the suction power in the middle position. Once switched on - you must not increase/decrease the performance, as the device switches off immediately. A pity, because the cheap device has been really top so far.",3
2690,The well-made trousers are very narrow at the abdominal height and therefore too tight. The leg length in relation to the hip width is only suitable for petite babies,3
2691,"I bought 2 of these table sockets to be able to charge the mobile phones in the bedroom on the bedside tables at night and still have socket space for a bedside lamp. as far as the sockets also fulfill their function without problems. unfortunately I have to subtract 2 stars because the sockets (one immediately, the other after about 2 weeks in operation) give a very high frequency permanent fiep sound. similar to a switched on tube TV in the past. ok most people will probably not or hardly take the sound (like my wife) but since I ""unfortunately"" have a very good hearing the sound bothers me a lot. that's why I will have to replace the sockets. gladly in the same product only without USB port. unfortunately I have not yet found this in white.",3
2692,"Lovingly designed and beautiful colors and pictures, actually very nice, but unfortunately the adhesive power of the stickers is not very high (on paper as well as on photos)",3
2693,"The set with cleaning and template etc is very easy to have hand. Our 8-year-old son can change the protective film on his own. Compared to other protective films, however, this seems very fragile. Furthermore, the protective film adheres surprisingly little - that's good if you have to replace it, but only then. 2 times bought because of the great handling - will now switch back to another product, because as described too sensitive",3
2694,I like it very much,3
2695,"... charges only with 0.5 A per slot ! In the Tello, the Accu is charged with 1 A, in other words: charging time with an Accu twice as long as with direct charging in the Tello. Since the Accu has 1.1 Ah, a charging time of almost 2 hours with a charging current of 0.5 A will result.",3
2696,"Large fits perfectly, only unfortunately color it is not pink, the jacket has arrived in beige. Too bad my niece was looking forward to pink. 😭😭😭",3
2697,"Unfortunately, the jacket lacks the lower inscription where Dri-Fit is written on it and the right small lower logo is also missing and the zipper is on the right side which I have never seen before.",3
2698,"I bought the set to cut a 3cm thick soft foam board. It worked, but only with a lot of patience. I had the feeling that the tip doesn't get really hot. Thus, it went forward only very slowly",3
2699,for the price you can not expect more. The scratching post is very unstable and should be additionally fastened.,3
2700,My thighs seem too thick or misshapen for these schoeners. At first they sit well but over time they slide down or roll up.,3
2701,"Beautifully structured, understandable and concisely written. Unfortunately, however, mainly basics are addressed - not worthwhile for people with well-founded, methodical previous knowledge.",3
2702,"The wristwatch only worked for a few hours, then standstill (battery empty)",3
2703,The accu is just like a normal one holds about 6 hours with prolonged use,3
2704,"In my case, I haven't really noticed any effect so far. Of course, it could also be that I didn't use it quite correctly. I have already used it as a foot bath and also checked by means of pH test strips whether it works, but so far unsuccessfully. More detailed information on the use would be good here.",3
2705,"Unfortunately, after only 5 months the wssser is in the right light",3
2706,The finger holder quickly becomes loose,3
2707,Does not fit well in the hand The hook is too long,3
2708,"I'm not quite satisfied with the look and the workmanship. The anchors look very ""cheap"". I will still incorporate them into bracelets Vlt the workmanship is no longer so noticeable.",3
2709,"Was honestly irritated at first, because the film stopped suddenly, then I looked after it and noticed that you have to turn the CD over once to continue watching we used to look at cassettes 😅 Unfortunately, this change lacks a few seconds of the film, is stupidly definite, but not dramatic, if you already know the film.",3
2710,A bottle arrived empty.,3
2711,Unfortunately after dressing 5 times the mother did not hold anymore,3
2712,Product already broken after 5 months!,3
2713,"The mechanism for holding the smartphone works reliably. If a massive protective case is attached to the smartphone, the clamps of the holder must be bent slightly. The ball head must be tightened occasionally. Since the vents in my car are too smooth to hold the weight of a smartphone, I rebuilt the holder.",3
2714,"With other editing program poor image quality, with the included software better image quality",3
2715,The condition of the book was very bad although it was new. I didn't buy it in a bookstore.,3
2716,"In itself I have to say that the table itself is very nice to look at, BUT there were several points where I have to say that the price of this table is NOT justified! If I could I would give 2.5 stars. As others have already said, there are several brands in the processing such as : -Dents on the legs, broken spots on the black wood which I had to retouch with a black marker and many sharp edges on the sheet metal! I don't want to start with the missing screws. Nevertheless, I keep the table, because if you do not look closely, it is not noticeable.",3
2717,"The shoe looks very good, but its fit does not match the size and it is very, very tight. I've been wearing Rieker shoes for years, which have always been very comfortable. So the disappointment was great",3
2718,Super lamp but no information about the charging times or service life (operating instructions),3
2719,Wasn't what I expected,3
2720,"The quality is fine but the dimensions do not correspond to the description. It is not 41 cm as indicated, but only 33 cm. Our hangover is 4.7 kg and for him it is too small. If it were 41 cm in height, the bag would be perfect.",3
2721,"Price/performance is right, but nothing more. The whole thing is a bit rattled, I expected that more stable. The ""leather strap"" (this is obviously artificial leather) is much too long and had to be shortened as well as re-perforated afterwards. No idea what giants this strap should fit. Do what it's supposed to, but nothing more.",3
2722,Relatively lumpy powder and taste was really too artificial and sweet for me personally. Could you have counted on Blueberry Cheese Cake vllcht...,3
2723,"Unfortunately can only rate 3 DVD's because these are also double-sided as described. Others are only described one-sidedly, and only with subtitles.With content of the DVD's everything is ok, exciting history should have been seen.",3
2724,No more performance after one year. Makes loud noises but no performance despite new filter,3
2725,"Sticking very much. The darkest tone is very beautiful, the light tone is more like a Barbie tone. I am rather dissatisfied because I thought they would be more comfortable to wear. Madels, hands off. You will not be satisfied",3
2726,"the oven will still not be clean by itself. Long exposure time and still a lot of effort, just have to do it again... But",3
2727,"Long waiting time, since export from China. Quality moderate, no comparison with comparable German products, but sensationally cheap (1€)",3
2728,Unfortunately it is too tight with the child seat.Otherwise it works,3
2729,"Delivery was fast and without problems. I am satisfied with the machine so far. Unfortunately, pimples under the device are missing the machine slips when cutting.",3
2730,"It is certainly a good solution to use an M.2 SSD externally as a storage medium, but the processing - well - there are BETTER, still suitable! - Conditional purchase recommendation",3
2731,Very nice bracelet but I bought a black one and within a few days it was dark green! That's why a star deduction!,3
2732,"As a private person, I was happy about the comparatively cheap alternative to Combur. Unfortunately, color fields run out again and again and mix with adjacent fields. In addition, the indication of nitrite does not seem to work, was indicated to me as negative, despite severe cystitis.",3
2733,"Otherwise, I always have a different product. I thought I'd give it a try because a friend recommended it. It's not bad but I won't buy it again.",3
2734,"Seams do not hold very well, after three washes already three parts with holes. But acceptable for the price and fit well.",3
2735,"Dog runs well,,unfortunately lock was already broken,,but I can live with that",3
2736,"Even though this tequila tasted very good to me, I unfortunately have to say that I reliably had to struggle with headaches from even one glass the next day, although I am not really inclined to it. I had only had the same experience with Beefeater Gin.",3
2737,"the jacket is sewn really well and stably in terms of quality, unfortunately the jacket was really much too big, but the functionality is the most important thing to me when it rains heavily here in the north",3
2738,"During training, the capsules are great you lose more calories and the result is top. But the intake is terrible: 1. I hardly bring down the capsules (just too big) and 2. The capsules smell very disgusting and when ingested this is very unpleasant. Otherwise top next to the sport!",3
2739,"Actually a beautiful mouse, feels relatively valuable, chic, flat design, which you have to get used to from the feel. Worked very well overall. Now, unfortunately, after only 2.5 years, a total failure. LED still shows battery voltage, but no function anymore. That is a bit too short in shelf life for me.",3
2740,"Rubber unfortunately dries up when washing... Otherwise, they fit as expected. So is not the hit but for the money ok...",3
2741,"Looks very good on the controller, but unfortunately this case is thicker than the original, which is extremely noticeable when gambling. Unfortunately for me a bad buy despite good reviews.",3
2742,"It is not squat proof. And unfortunately, within 2 days the logo went off. And I washed them by hand, and air-dried them. But this error also occurs with high-quality tights.",3
2743,Was good but didn't last long,3
2744,"but only if you share the hose. The hose is supplied with a connection on both ends. If you try to operate it only over one side, the first 1 1/2 meters are soaking wet - nothing comes behind it. I then cut the hose into 3 parts and connected it via a distributor - this works quite well.",3
2745,"I ordered the dress for carnival. It is very comfortable to wear. However, it was too far from above. Since I was unfortunately very close with my order, I have now sewn the dress tighter myself. Now it fits a ready for use. Thus, I recommend ordering a smaller number with a small bust....",3
2746,Very nice string lights unfortunately one was defective and I could not decorate as I had imagined. Very unfortunate If both had worked I would have given full stars.,3
2747,A very nice product unfortunately not as hoped but since the tastes are different therefore 3 stars,3
2748,Poor to adjust (loops). Shoe compartment difficult to use when bag is not empty. Price/Performance OK,3
2749,Looks elegant. Fits very well. Recommend.,3
2750,Only three stars because when using it 2nd time unfortunately went directly broken... Plastic broken off on the lid.. otherwise a great thing small rechargeable via usb,3
2751,"Unfortunately, I didn't like the watch very much...",3
2752,The product itself is ok but I have been told by a few customers that it burns more often. 3 stars anyway because only a few said it.,3
2753,"The workmanship is good, smells strong, but that should be gone after a few days of ventilation. What bothers - the dimensions are not the right ones. The size L is given as L 70 x 52 x 52 cm. In fact, it is about 63 x 48 x 48 Thought only we got M, but it is even smaller. We send it back now, but not because of the false information or the smell, our dog is too small. Get us now the bag in S.",3
2754,"The wicks burn off super clean, unfortunately the wick detached from the compression exactly in the period when we added the wax",3
2755,"The napkins are so really nice but I ordered too many of them and now I am unlucky and have to pay for the shipping alone if I want to send them back. I find that unfriendly to customers. In the future, I'd be better off not ordering from third-party providers here.",3
2756,"The blanket is very cuddly but also quite thin and the workmanship also leaves a little room for improvement, a few seams have come loose but still have not fallen apart.",3
2757,"is not mine, tastes a bit artificial. but tastes are different.",3
2758,Well the fit is not optimal is slightly crooked on my watch,3
2759,"Unfortunately we had to return the pillow because the cover was not cotton, as ordered.",3
2760,The attachment is a bit difficult. Slight blistering between smartphone and foil is possible from time to time. But still very good scratch protection. Price performance also okay here.,3
2761,"Big problems during assembly. The diameter of the socket is 16.4 mm. An assembly was only possible with soap and hammer. After assembly, the whole thing makes a stable impression. Small mirror, but inconspicuous and good visibility. Let's see how long it lasts.",3
2762,Everything top except for a few little things. There are slight wear and tear on the watch,3
2763,"For some air movement ok, nothing more.",3
2764,"The case is very nice, unfortunately the metal part fell out directly and now the flap no longer holds. Too bad!",3
2765,Everything worked out well.,3
2766,"Yes, you can grate a wolf. The arrows are unwieldy. Not suitable for fine corners. My fingernails are now super short. The arrows always find a corner. The rough structure does not work at all. The filigree is missing. The outer coat is too thick. Good idea. Nevertheless, I would like to give it back. There is a lack of front and back. The Lion King.👎",3
2767,"Unfortunately, the tea towels suck very badly. Hopefully it will get better over time",3
2768,"For a flacon such a large packaging is exaggerated. Only one bottle is contained in the packaging shown, but there would certainly be room for four in it.",3
2769,"In general, you are good for 10 € with this set. But there are deductions. On the one hand, the bracket is really tight! Not too tight! But really very narrow. Pull the brackets apart and turn the screw out beforehand. Already the lamp fits in and out again, a small effort is necessary. On the other hand, the bracket does not dampen very well. Unfortunately, the light flickers during vibrations, which gradually got worse, the LED intervals also adjusted repeatedly. Suddenly it dims, because it flashes. There is no clear purchase recommendation, even if the LED is very bright and the rear light has no defects. The product is not reliable enough for that!",3
2770,"I'm not quite through yet, but so far it hasn't been so interesting. Maybe it will be... I hope !",3
2771,Have had the device since April. Works perfectly. Except for a few weeks ago.. I hear a noise that sounds strange and what makes me very sad is that the device no longer foams. 😔,3
2772,"Unfortunately, I had to send the speedometer back because a small part that is necessary for assembly was missing. Otherwise, the speedometer looked robust and as described by the seller. I was able to return the item without any problems and will now order it again. So I can only give a real star rating afterwards, after proper assembly and testing.",3
2773,"Seller: very friendly (phone call) Goods: Battery - about 3 hours charged, Effect: None - Smartphone can not be switched on.",3
2774,Was only given away at Easter. Hope he's iO.,3
2775,From my DVD box was unfortunately on the side something ripped off and a DVD was completely loose in it (see picture) Otherwise the DVD runs fortunately. Delivery was even a 1day earlier than thought.,3
2776,Is a nice watch there is not much to expose unless you go from the warm to the outside the glass starts!!! Although it should be waterproof therefore only 3 stars,3
2777,"Can be easily mounted, very precisely fitting. A big drawback is that the color goes off after a few weeks on the normal contact surface next to the closure and the whole band thus looks inferior. Whatever it is. No recommendation, no repurchase",3
2778,"In and of itself, the mobile phone is certainly not bad but in the processing it can not reach known manufacturers the water. I sent mine back (problem-free) because the home button didn't work properly, so only 3 stars. Software and camera as well as all other processes worked 1 A",3
2779,"Wonderful birdhouse Good assembly However, 2 holes were missing that we had to drill and the string of lights broke directly",3
2780,"The cure as a whole is very pleasant for the body, after 18 days I feel very fit and purify. However, the indicated amounts of the powder and tea are not sufficient for 30 days. Both products were taken meticulously exactly, are now already coming to an end, maybe it will be enough for 2 days. I don't think that's fair, because I've adjusted to 30 days and also invested the money for the entire fasting time. This is very unsatisfactory.",3
2781,I only downloaded it at first because it was free. But I found some interesting snacks that I will try in a moment.,3
2782,"Power button on the handheld device must be operated with a lot of force, replacing or emptying the dirt container is quite ""fiddly"", this is also quite small. But for the small household use at a price of just under 70,00 € I can recommend the device quite well, is light, handy and movable, brush roller can be removed for cleaning, the battery lasts longer than stated in the description. My grade 2-3.",3
2783,"We bought 14 stands here and were able to get a great insight! Delivery********* The shipping took place via Amazon and was therefore quickly with us. The materials were very well packaged, no part had scratches or the like. Content******** The goods come off well protected, every part was well packed and had no scratch dents! Unfortunately, we left the goods for too long, and have only now encountered errors, some parts such as the upper pipes had no hole where the screw could be screwed. Some threads for the screws were also not good and could not be screwed! For the price, the quality of the material is ok, only errors can occur, so do not wait too long with the construction, so that in time can be complained! Construction******** A manual is included, easy to read all bags are marked with letters and thus you can quickly find the corresponding screw! Replacement screws are enclosed with every delivery! I would be happy about a useful.",3
2784,"Everything supi. But unfortunately some things were broken off, many scratches and some were bent. For beginners OK.",3
2785,"I'm not really thrilled. Material is very hard and not at all flexible. Thinking, is not really suitable for ears",3
2786,Could be a bit sharper but okay for the price,3
2787,"Protective cover sits a bit loose, otherwise good",3
2788,Super fast delivery. The worm cure smells of herbs and is unfortunately in capsules my dog has spit them out again.,3
2789,"Boring story, too many clichés, little girl falls in love with old man with history",3
2790,"Light is too cold, uncomfortable in the living area, energy information has not been checked. Delivery on time, packaging was o.k. Klaus Dieter müller",3
2791,Quality in itself good but unfortunately they slip down much too fast & curl up.,3
2792,"Had to place it on the dashboard, underneath or behind the A-pillars fairing not a good signal.",3
2793,"Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery today still drives cheerfully through the republic with Hermes without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with the triggering of a replacement delivery was as always excellent. The mower quickly arrived at my place and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and results in a nice cut. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but ok. A big drawback is unfortunately the catch basket. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and made of fabric in between. If you only put it down for a short time, then of course it is compressed and parts of the content fall out. Worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator already points to red when the catch basket is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the cuttings from then on. Always emptying the basket on a large lawn when it is only half full cannot be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, which becomes unusable for me due to the unfortunate construction of the catch basket.",3
2794,I can't judge because the dpd service was not there yet. And I've been waiting for it since Saturday and don't get any feedback,3
2795,Doe screws did not fit my RearBoxes,3
2796,"... there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect, I would have forgiven 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run evenly (if at all!). Also the additional plastic waste (individually packed see photo) means for me a star deduction. I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon gets full score.",3
2797,"The story is nice and entertaining. In some places a bit long-winded. Unfortunately, the last chapters were printed in the wrong order, so there was a lot of confusion. What a pity.",3
2798,"Compared to the big Pixar productions, this film is very suitable for the family but leaves something to be desired in terms of humor. All in all, however, it is more than suitable for viewing!",3
2799,"For the water they are not suitable, because water runs into the ear and then the sound is gone. however, they do not work under water despite water. so if you like to dive from time to time I recommend spending a little more money.",3
2800,"The tea lights are by and large very beautiful, only I am disappointed with the battery life. A few hours (about 4 hours) the ""candles"" shine really great and flicker, but then there is hardly anything to see. I prefer to go back to the classic tea lights.",3
2801,Delivery took 5 days instead of 2-3 days,3
2802,"Keeps off cold, but is not extra ""fed"". But I was looking for the lined one, as our windows are drafty. Well, they're fine, but I'm not thrilled. Color (gray) is nice but..",3
2803,"By and large, serves its purpose. Sometimes it does not pull the air out or the weld seam is not properly tightened. Then you just have to try more often..",3
2804,"For the money quite ok, I used the bag for our civil wedding and did not want to spend much money for the few hours I use it. That was the way it was.",3

2809,"So on the whole the watch pleases, but it would have been nice if the size had stood there. For the designated space in the kitchen it is too small for me. But that's how she gets to another room.",3
2810,"The cable is very long, the sound is good. Press extremely on the ears after a while.",3
2811,Long delivery time came but then as ordered and works,3
2812,"The cutlery looks quite good. Unfortunately, the packaging, where it also says : ""Your Gift"" on it is not particularly well suited as gift packaging. Better a better packaging where the cutlery is neatly in it and make it a bit more expensive. Unfortunately, you can't give it away like that. Now there are again costs for a proper packaging.",3
2813,The shell is of higher quality. But what I didn't like so much is that the previous model was 2016 with a kind of suction cup. Which made the shell appear more valuable and high-quality. This shell is like any other China shell to clamp in. Which still has to be bad. But I liked the 2016 model a lot better.,3
2814,"Fast delivery, items as described.",3
2815,The palette is much warmer than the pictures show. Pigmentation is there. It is easy to work with. OK.,3
2816,"The gate is easy to set up and also fits from the size. Unfortunately, the weak point is the network. After a few shots, it tears. We had a Hudora goal before and knotted it again and again. With the current gate, I feel like the net is even worse (or my son now has a stronger lock). But unfortunately I did not find an alternative at the same price.",3
2817,"Is quite fine in itself, but I find expensive for the quality. Sharp edges and strange stains when it gets wet, which can not be avoided in the shower",3
2818,"The owl is very nicely processed, no unpleasant smell. Only the bottle for filling was unfortunately leaking after 2 weeks. We saved ourselves the trouble and did not contact the seller but bought a new inner bottle. Otherwise, it is a really very nice product",3

2820,"Are weights and do what they are supposed to do, namely be correspondingly heavy. Unfortunately also arrived partly with rust. The long dumbbells were a mistake as they are impractical for certain exercises. My eyes were bigger than my biceps. Unfortunately, the ""paint"" of the dumbbells is already peeling, and the screw caps do not hold properly on the thread either. Since I have older dumbbells that are qualitatively better.",3
2821,"Chairs look good and fine, but the quality leaves much to be desired... you sit well and comfortably but the many plastic joints and hinges do not look so good. A chair also cracks at the joint when you sit down. I bought the chairs as a set of 2 for my balcony. If you only use them once in a while, they are top, but with daily use you should rather spend a little more money and invest in better chairs. Delivery as usual fast... Mfg",3

2828,Fast delivery. Product is great. Just in the packaging a bit stupid to use,3
2829,"In itself, the product is well made and positive to add is that it comes with 2 interchangeable heads, in different sizes and needle lengths. However, the needles are quite angular processed, so that the treatment can be quite painful. Therefore, the product has been eliminated from my weekly beauty routine.",3

I will definitely consume the bottle but certainly not order anymore.",3

However, the chain is very easy to process overall, so that I have already torn open the closure twice. So far I have been able to repair it again and again, but I think that this will not go well for long. But for the low price you simply can't expect anything really high-quality.",3

2855,"In December 2018 I bought the set. After about 9 days it arrived, okay, it was Christmas time and DHL was probably a bit overloaded. The sound in games is a bit dull, but quite convincing with video and music. For the price quite top, no hi-fi quality, but that is also not to be expected. The subwoofer ensures decent bass and the satellite speakers have a clear sound and good reproduction of voices. The workmanship is flawless. So, if you want good sound for a relatively low price, quite recommended. But now the reason why I deducted 2 stars from my rating: The system has an automatic shutdown, which is extremely annoying. I immediately criticized them and wrote to Teufel, whether you can not switch them off (and in my case the shutdown did not happen after 20 minutes, but somewhere between 5-20 minutes). After 1 week came a reply that my email had arrived. After about 1 month came the answer that this would not be possible, but I would like to send it in if it would happen after 5 instead of 20 minutes. I have been using the system for several months now and came to the following conclusion: The shutdown is done by the subwoofer, which means that for signals with little bass it is considered no signal. So it can happen that in the middle of a video, where only talking, it just goes out in the middle of it. The light of the subwoofer is at the rear, so you can not see whether the system is on or off. Devil: Remove this cursed shutdown and a light to the front and it's a top system. Answer emails at least within a week and not after 1 month.",3

2863,"Unfortunately, the belly bag for the smartphone or for a keychain or for a pack of handkerchiefs is too narrow and therefore unsuitable. It is also inappropriate for children, as you can not stretch the belt so shorter that it sits tightly on the stomach. What a pity. A case for the flea market. Shipping and packaging were top but. The workmanship is also good. But a single handkerchief or a single key fits in. who needs it.",3

Do you give it to a 4-year-old and he stands on the shovel surface and pulls the handle upwards... or push the shovel into heavy, icy snow and try to lift the white mass... yes, then you only have the rod (without shovel) in your hand. The plastic cracks. If you basically have powder snow or sand, you can certainly have a lot of fun with the shovel for a long time. We had fun, but only very briefly ;-) Would I buy it again? Humph.. maybe, but before that, my little Rambo needs a briefing so that he handles it more carefully.",3

However, I have not yet tested it in use. I quickly noticed that the device probably had a few imprints of greasy fingers - a first indication that the device may have been in use or at least in other hands. The operating instructions also show signs of kink and use. When looking at the clamping nut, I noticed further traces of use (scratches). That wouldn't be too bad. But the problem is that the device is meant as a gift. Since I don't know if and how long the device has been in use, the whole thing annoys me a bit, to be honest. When I buy a new device, I expect a new device as well. Good the 2 years warranty I have anyway. But hope that the device does not cause trouble with the gifted... Therefore, in the end only 3 stars.",3

The smell is a mixture of honey and orange but not natural... The application itself is simple and can be rubbed well. I myself have stretch marks from my pregnancy which is now 9 years ago. I thought to myself, ""oh come on, give it a try."" But if I think about applying cream twice a day, I think the fading of the ""scars"" and the regular creaming, also creates a conventional cream. So I can't see much improvement. Maybe it's also because my stripes are so old. Perhaps others have had better experiences with new scars. But for me, unfortunately, that was nothing.",3

Since I like the vintage style for a long time I searched here and found this backpack! I can't complain! Workmanship top, keeps water off great, zippers go well and space is also enough for me. My laptop fits perfectly in the back pocket. Maybe a small padding on the bottom of the backpack would be useful, because e.B. the laptop hits the floor a bit if the backpack falls down. Sounds worse than it really is. the laptop still has its own smell at the beginning, as it was probably still greased, but passed after a few days of use! My backpack is a bit darker than in the picture, but I personally find it more beautiful anyway. It is also comfortable to wear, and different lengths of the straps can also be adjusted. All in one a super backpack that does its purposes, is top processed and looks beautiful. Is a good companion for my everyday university life. Long-term update: Unfortunately, the first ""rivets"" come off the backpack after just a few months. After about 1 year, unfortunately, a retaining bracket of the backpack is torn off. The reason was another rivet that came loose and the other second rivet could no longer carry the load on its own. I have already glued the temple several times to continue using the backpack, but this is a pity.",3

And as a man, I certainly don't have a thick neck, rather normal. If I try to push the piece from the neck over the chin then it is completely over, much too tight. Why manufacturers can't produce proper sizes these days, a mystery, is it because of saving material...? - The cord: I cut off immediately, a contract to a cap so that the opening closes completely is NOT possible. - first hand wash: the rinsing water looks like from the slurry, greenish dark colored, scary...., what kind of chemistry is in it?",3

Reviews that think that they find the fan quiet or do not perceive it at all, I can not understand at all. The image quality, however, made me satisfied in the first impression. Both in brightness, as well as sharpness and color, I had nothing to complain about in my short moments with the beamer. The workmanship also looks high-quality and in addition some cables and a remote control are included, which also look solid. The whole thing comes packed in a pretty box. Too bad I relied on the reviews that described the fan as quiet. So I will send the beamer back.",3

What bothers me are the additions, such as cranberries, carrots, potatoes, parsley, aloe vera, rosemary, etc., which actually have no place in cat food. Probably my cat does not tolerate this and constantly has mushy stools. That's why I'm going to change the type of food now.",3

For the price completely okay, of course you have to try what temperature with how many burners etc. I had the grill all burners at full power at 28 degrees outside temperature in just under 10 minutes to 350 degrees.

3073,"Because my old wireless headphones will soon fall apart from misery, a new one had to be found. In my youth, I owned a wired headphone from Sennheiser, which I liked very much at the time. That's why I have now once again opted for headphones from this manufacturer. Assembly and commissioning is actually easy for experienced users of wireless headphones because the controls are no different from other wireless headphones. It is once again due to my visual impairment that the assembly took me longer. At first I was able to cope without a user manual, but when I had searched for the contacts for charging, the first problems appeared. The included quick start guide consists almost exclusively of pictures, I can't do much with it. So I first had to search the Internet for the operating instructions. Then I held the wall mounting device for the power socket and then wondered why the thing didn't charge until I discovered the right socket. Last but not least, there was no signal and the headphones served as a receiver of a Polish transmitter, with which I could not do anything. I assumed that the audio cable could be defective and was already on the verge of packing the thing again, but then it worked out at some point and I had a signal. I think that the battery was not yet properly charged, then such headphones like to bitch around. But now everything works and I give the headphones another chance, although they have some shortcomings. Pros: Charging is easy. The headphones are simply placed on the metal frame of the transmitter with the magnetic contacts on the temple, no more annoying fumbling with the contacts. The headphones are comfortable to wear. The sound is good, at least when watching TV. How it looks when listening to music, I have not checked yet. I only tried one Christmas CD for a short time, with which I had had problems with another wireless headphone. Quiet passages were not transmitted. However, the problem did not occur with these headphones. Choir and classical music fans can therefore use this device. Most of the buttons are easy to touch, except for the lever on the transmitter, which allows you to adjust the frequency range. The headphones can therefore also be operated by elderly or disabled people. The audio cable is relatively long, so you can also use the headphones for two playback devices such as .B TV and PC when they are close to each other. The playback starts very quickly, shortly after switching on. Cons: The workmanship is not very high quality. Especially the inner lining of the earcups, which covers the speakers, is very thin. The audio cable is permanently installed in the transmitter. This is not without its problems. If the cable gives up its ghost, you can probably throw the whole thing away, because a repair is not worthwhile with a device in this price range. Sustainable has to be different somehow. The power cord is a bit too short for my taste. The power socket is difficult to access. It took a lot of effort to plug in the cable. The transmitter is a bit shaky because it is very narrow and high. The operating instructions must, as unfortunately so often with electrical appliances, be retrieved on the Internet. Stupid if you don't have the Internet, which can happen with older people. Only a quick start guide is supplied, which describes the commissioning only figuratively. This is useless for the visually impaired and blind. I'm curious to see how long it lasts. My bishe",4

3113,Bought the money brise a few months ago And so far I have had no problems with it The material is excellent The workmanship is excellent The durability is excellent I can only recommend. -1 star due to a delay of 1 day in delivery,4
3114,"At first I was a bit put off by the few very negative reviews. But since I did not find anything comparable in the price category, I struck. The shipping took 5 days with the forwarding agency as indicated - the carrier put the pallet in the hallway for us. In total, there were three packages: one the back wall and two packages for bed box and drawers. Here I can not understand the first bad reviews: Yes, there are many parts and yes, that takes time. But neither is the instructions incomprehensible, nor were parts missing or damaged. All in all, the bed was easy to build and is not unstable. Nothing wobbles and the parts and fittings are more than fine for this price. Finally, I deduct a star because the whole thing was delivered on a pallet, which I now have in the basement and somehow have to dispose of - and because the delivery included trim strips that probably do not belong to the bed - I also have to dispose of them. However, I am very happy with the whole purchase and would recommend the bed.",4
3115,"I ordered the Beauty Hylauron because I was curious and wanted to try something new in addition to the daily creams. The delivery was made by Amazon prime very fast and the hyaluron is delivered in a beautiful and high-quality packaging. You drink one bottle a day and after about a week the first results became visible to me. I had the impression that my skin was more plumped, my hair a little healthier and my nails firmer. Of course, these shots are not miracle cures but I have to say that I am really surprised by the effect. However, I give one star less, as the taste is not particularly appealing. Nevertheless, clear recommendation",4

Unfortunately, the seal does not fit, it is too thick, the doors can no longer be closed. Of course, this does not reduce the quality of the product but was a mistake on my part, I should have taken the measure into account. Really a pity, in itself a very good product.

Compared to my medical scale at home, the display differs by a maximum of 0.5kg - so in my opinion it is sufficiently accurate.",4

Personally, I do not consider the quality of the plastic to be as high as with Original, which is why I only have 4 stars. There are 5 stars if the headphones are still working after two months. After two weeks of intensive testing, I can only say that the price-performance ratio is very good.",4

Otherwise, the case absolutely fulfills its purpose and also looks great!",4
3160,"Bought the fly for a carnival costume (Mary Poppins). Value for money is okay. However, I found the fly a bit large and reduced it a bit by sewing it together at the back and cut it off at the edges. Color also corresponds to the one shown in the product picture.",4

To protect the color, I recommend a 30-minute bath in vinegar water before use and after use only by hand in vinegar water. In this way, the color is preserved forever. The quality is very good on everyone, for the money.",4
3169,"Actually, we are very satisfied with these vacuum cleaners. Our mouse copes well with it. What I have to complain about the Nuk vacuum cleaners, however, is the air system, which never works properly at the beginning.

3170,"The price-performance ratio is hard to beat, as there is very little to complain about with this inexpensive sheet. The size is quite universal with 140-160 cm and therefore of course a bit too big for my 1.40 m wide bed. However, it could be a bit longer, as it already stretches at the bottom, which could also be due to my thicker mattress. The color is very beautiful, the fabric does not look cheap and the sheet is also not transparent.",4

3173,"The product itself is visually appealing and easy to handle. However, the well must be one hundred percent straight so that everything overflows evenly.

Especially small temperature differences are displayed very slowly. Competing products, on the other hand, are slightly faster. All in all, for the hobby area and with some experience in the kitchen a good alternative.",4
3188,"The gloves keep nice and warm, the main task is fulfilled. The processing could be better, I already had to sew separated seams. For someone who can handle needle and thread, not a big problem. The upper on the back of the hand is very good and durable, but the material on the palms is not convincing. The small pimples quickly envel in and the fabric is not well suited to touch something when hiking. With rough material such as branches and stones, supports on rocks, etc., threads are pulled and the fabric looks ""ripped"". When walking without contact with nature, however, these deficiencies will hardly occur.",4

3190,"The folding table has its first tests behind it. But first things first: after delivery and unpacking, I had to deburr a few places on the surrounding plastic on the bottom of the table top with a small file, but this was basically unproblematic and done in a few minutes. To the actual things: Fold out and fold in again works perfectly, the table is stable and firm. The struts and hinges are cleanly worked, nothing is bent or has dents. The polyrattan on the surface does not look cheap, at this price already (in a positive sense) quite surprising. At 12 kg, the table is not necessarily a lightweight, but also not too heavy for short transport routes. And for the stability, a few kg are quite an advantage. The table can easily cope with a week in the great outdoors in wind and weather, spray once with the hose, wipe with water and a dash of detergent, rub dry and the table stands there like new. Overall, and especially with regard to the almost extremely low price, a clear purchase recommendation. I leave out the 5th star, because some people could have overlooked the 2, 3 somewhat sharp-edged spots at the bottom of MY table and it could then possibly come to a few minor skin injuries on the fingers.... if you're not careful.",4

3194,"The selfie stick is made of carbon and Sirui-typical (produced by Sirui) well made. The bullet-time function with the handle also leaves a good impression. The tripod function consists of 3 fold-out plastic parts and the joint for folding is also made of plastic. For the weight of the Insta360 One x this is certainly sufficient but in my opinion still the weak point of the entire construction because it probably does not need a lot of stress to break out one of the feet. In addition, however, everything fits together, can be screwed well and easily and does what it should or as it is specified in the description. If the feet were made of metal, I would give the 5th star.",4

Visually, the book by DuMont is well prepared, but even finding information is not always easy.

The fabric was high quality. The embroideries look good and are well made. The shirt wears well on the body. It is elastic and gives way with the movements. It is a little smaller, should therefore be ordered with reserve.a point deduction for the size table.. my husband wears normal 3xl have ordered it extra in 5 xl and it just goes like this.. order a size bigger",4

3225,"A very nice case, which I think fits perfectly to the rose golden iPhone. It is made of soft silicone and is therefore very pleasant. The buttons are easy to press and the screen is perfectly protected. But negatively I find that the case, because it is so soft, scratches a bit and after some time the cover turns yellowish, which is actually normal with transparent covers (unfortunately).",4
3226,"The device itself is wonderful. Looks great and sounds very good on radio and CD. Only with the turntable the pickup does not work properly, so that all depths are missing. My old turntable had a corresponding control - but there is no such thing here. I ask the seller for a replacement pickup.",4
3227,"I needed the keyboard for my TV PC because my old keyboard / mouse was broken. I was looking for something cheap, because I don't work on the PC too often. The keyboard itself is nice and small and so is the mouse. Typing on the keyboard is actually quite pleasant and not too loud. However, the one star had to be subtracted because the range of the transmitter does not really go far. My PC is maybe 2 meters from my sitting area and I have problems with the mouse function and the keyboard function from time to time. If I come a little closer, both work perfectly again. You should also be careful not to hang the transmitter next to a WLan stick. If you transmit in the WLan on the frequency 2.4 GHz so it can happen that there are disturbances both with the mouse, but also with the WLan, since the mouse also sends on 2.4 GHz. But on the whole I'm happy with it :-)",4

But I only got a completely dark gray one. But is not bad also looks good. Hope is not the case with my other 2 pants! And the only thing that bothers is the trouser stable which is not available that you could have left out does not look really good and the buttons from the rubber band have fallen off directly but that does not matter.

3263,The shoes themselves are not particularly great. But I'm very happy with it.,4
3264,"I am very satisfied with the reflectors. They hold well, look good and make you clearly visible. I find the price reasonable. Basically, they are just plastic pieces, but compared to many other reflectors on the bike, these are exceptionally really worth their money.",4

3266,"The Snoopy shoulder bag by Small Foot is first and foremost very spacious. There are several compartments that you can easily get to, so that you can easily get to everything you put in your pocket. The design itself is also very beautiful, and of course I am particularly pleased as a Snoopy fan. The workmanship looks very clean and therefore also looks stable, so that it does not break immediately if you pack too much into it. On delivery, the zippers are also specially packed. This should probably contribute to the fact that they themselves can not break or scratch anything else. But I still give a star deduction for this, because I think that's too much packaging for this shoulder bag. Here you can protect the environment even more.",4
3267,at the price I consider myself lucky to have received such a knife. The cut is normally sharp. haven't used it for long but every day. professionally and privately (carpenter). it is enough to pull it off easily and you grin.,4

3269,"Already have several AmazonBasics articles and am satisfied again this time. Good workmanship, works flawlessly and also visually successful. Only the cable itself is a bit thick and thus a bit stiff, which then probably prevents an unintentional buckling, but also does not hang down on the edge of the table but rather protrudes. For whom this does not matter, however, clear purchase recommendation!",4

3281,"Quite ok but the control only goes in two directions, forward and backward",4
3282,It's because of Sandra Bullock alone that the film is worth it; but also the family of the alleged fiancé with their different figures is played nicely. The film flattens out a bit towards the end and thus loses its tension - the happy ending is clear longer beforehand.,4
3283,"Assembled, it looks exactly like in the picture. However, the cardboard in which the shelf arrived was dirty (old cobwebs, dust, dirt etc) and also the individual wooden parts of the shelf looked partly like this. You really must not use packaging like e.g. IKEA expect and also not the cleanliness. Probably, the shelves are simply stored outside. The construction was quite fine and the finished product visually beautiful. There is also a lot of space for shoes, but they are available for large shoe sizes (with us 42 and 43). This is not a problem with the lower shelves because you can simply push them through and then you can not see it from the front, but the first board has this bow why you can not push anything through and since this is the only possible floor to store even higher shoes (ankle boots or similar) looks quite strange. Nevertheless, I can positively note that it is visually beautiful and stable and also offers quite a lot of storage space for the shoes. Due to the already watching pictures of the shelf, it should be logical that thin heels can slip through the grooves of the shelf. Delivery was also fast.",4
3284,"The bottle came quickly and looks good. However, the cardboard is brown and not black as in the pictures.",4

In this working environment, it does a good job and is very flexible thanks to the material used and also gets into the last corners. For large bottles, the brush is of course unsuitable, since the rod measures only 25cm, of which 8cm on the handle are omitted. For this purpose, a slightly longer version should be offered.",4
3290,"The suction power is very good, but I always have the feeling that the device sucks until the battery is empty. Once he fell down the stairs, which should not happen. Unfortunately, he also likes to get stuck at our closet door. The suction power is good, you should really remove all cables.",4

3294,"The cart arrived very punctually. All parts, such as wheels and sapwood, were securely attached to the frame so that nothing is lost. A protection of the underside for transport to the buyer would still be desirable. The cart comfortably balances heavy boxes and is therefore a great help. All weld points and seams look valuable and on the whole the frame of the sack truck makes a stable impression on me. It is very good that they have a continuous axle installed. A star trigger because of the loose handles, which can quickly mutate into a risk of accidents. Instead of the sapwood, I recommend adjusting rings. The space on the axle is sufficient and the wheels then no longer egg.",4

3300,"The round tip protection came a day earlier than indicated. The plastic feels stable and looks milky transparent. I bought a very simple school bag in the size 70 cm to be able to decorate it. In my blank, the tip protection has a few millimeters of play and is not really tight. But I think with a blob of (hot) glue, the plastic cap will last for that one day.",4
3301,"A bit too big if you're small. Am 1.60 and wear between M and S. With tops, M often fits, but here the sleeves are a little long and it sits loosely. But it goes and maybe it will still go in. I think the neckline is good, not too deep, but also not too far up. It also wears well, comfortably.",4
3302,"Since this product has a lower dosage than other products, I ordered this for my son to take (he is 8 years young). My son takes one tablet every day and taking it is extremely straightforward as the tablets are very small. Unfortunately, the packaging is not nearly full, which means that a lot of packaging material is used unnecessarily. Since the product is only enough for 30 days with normal use and even then, in my experience, is underdosed for an adult, I deduct a point.",4

3304,"The auna system was delivered quickly and safely (despite alleged delivery difficulties). The satellites are individually packaged, including the subwoofer. Everything is set up quickly and the connection via Bluetooth is stable and runs perfectly. The only downside: The cables for the satellites are very short and the subwoofer is quickly overwhelmed.

Only the covers for the neck supports are more than scarce, but feasible. The artificial leather is insensitive and has already survived milk, chocolate and mushy dog paws without any problems.

3323,"Do what it's supposed to. However, such a large tarpaulin stows worse than a small one. What I don't like is that you can't pinch the tarpaulin in the doors. Even if the theft risk for such a product may not be the greatest, I would like to see a low level of security.",4

When snapting the actual holder to the base plate, you have to proceed carefully, otherwise there is a risk that the plate and tablet will slip out.

Even without this cover, the seat gets my clear recommendation because of the build quality and the comfort.",4

You should remove the sealing seal under the lid before use, then the closed tube can also be ""kneaded"" well to achieve a homogeneous paste.

In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump by a few meters, which is not disturbing. Would buy me again anytime. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently it lasts about 1.5 hours. Here a solution would be great which would manage 7-14 days. There is an XL version but unfortunately this is too big for our taste, as long as the battery would not have to last with us and daily change we also find impractical.

Waterproof and very chic Have only had it for a week so can not say much about the durability of the backpack, but looks very stable and the material high quality :-) has a laptop compartment and inside and outside each a smaller compartment for purse, which is definitely sufficient with the size etc) The size fits well for laptop + coffee + one or the other snack, so quasi the office essentials ;-) The only drawback for me are the unpadded straps, they seem very stable but believe that if the backpack is heavily loaded it could be a bit uncomfortable to carry (however, in terms of size, this is really not the backpack that has enough space to load it particularly hard) So I'm very happy with it :-))",4

3365,"The device works great! You can take it with you everywhere as it is very compact. For me, this product is perfect because if you have 2 batteries in time you can use one and charge the other in that time!

When you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and knows nothing to appreciate, and does not learn! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How many times have I just thought about the film (even though I know that it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, there are often tears in your eyes. That's why Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is really neatly done. It's just a pity that the person just doesn't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film. We consistently destroy the animal and the environment and ultimately our planet and us. Out of greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings :No indication. 4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema.",4

3415,... otherwise chic and easy to clean.,4
3416,"Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all this in featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually judge the goods after the first use. First of all, I can say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can't really imagine packing everything there, e.B. for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can be directly in the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/sachets. Not high-quality workmanship, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok.",4
3417,"Lamp works one-free. But beware if the space for the lamp is limited. Eg. In table lamp etc. where previously a normal candle with standard size was installed, it may be that the lamp does not fit because it is larger in size than normal.",4

3419,very practical drain and shapely but I had to replace the upper sealing ring because it was not tight otherwise ok therefore a star deduction further I noticed that the drain is positioned relatively high up in the open state because the lid can not be lowered further down,4
3420,It suits my daughter very well. But the ears were a bit too big than expected. But very comfortable to carry. The color is also very nice as in the original.,4
3421,"Fits well in the hand, eyelet is also good. Lace is well worked out. I bought several at the same time.",4
3422,Something hard to do. We also created extinguishers for 2 candles although we did it exactly according to instructions. But are still very much at peace.,4

3424,"I like the watch very well visually and in the handling. The data is super transmitted, as I work with a bonus program. Charging the battery very quickly. In the fitness app googlefit you can easily specify your activities there and are quickly transmitted by the integrated app smartlife. Swimming has survived the clock without any problems. Only trigger of the closure once it has opened, because I wear the watch also at the workplace because of the pedometer.",4
3425,"What shall I say... The first impression was, okay, quality like a chewing gum machine ring. We unpacked the good piece and tried it out immediately. I can only say TOP suction power. That there is no brush, at the bottom of the part, fits me very well. So my cotton carpets are spared, great. The cable length is too short for me personally. As it is, I am satisfied. However, there is a point deduction because of the unnecessary packaging, too much cardboard for such a small device. Not environmentally friendly.",4
3426,"Fast delivery, stops more often",4

I have been using the Hoop for about 3 weeks now about 4-5 per week and could already see that the exercises have helped with the shape of the body.

You have to be patient...",4

3430,"The device itself is quite good and sufficient for our purposes. The pancakes take a bit long and you have to know exactly how much dough you have to use. This takes a little practice. The first time the dough went into every crack with me. Otherwise, the device is quite ok",4
3431,Fast delivery. Works perfectly.,4
3432,"Bought the lamp to be able to read in bed next to the baby. In our 20sqm bedroom, however, it is like a floodlight. But 1 star trigger. Otherwise, it fulfills its purpose, works without problems, makes a valuable impression and was neatly packaged.",4

3436,"I used the product for a drawer in the bathroom. Unfortunately, I did not find a comparable product in terms of dimensions, hence this purchase. However, I am of the opinion that the price/performance ratio is not right here. Despite the good quality, it is simply too expensive.",4
3437,"The rails are a little too filigree. But in itself it serves its purpose, and the result is presentable.",4
3438,Looks great only could be a little cheaper for the size and because it is actually just a sticker.,4

3441,"Beautiful and unobtrusive. Pleasantly round edges (I find it important when holding, e.B. around the USB port). Is a bit too slippery in the (dry) hand for my taste, but still absolutely fine and much better than without a case. ;)",4
3442,The cover made a very good and finished impression after unpacking. So immediately the tablet stowed in it and lo and behold the touch screen it reacts only very limited. Out again with it and installed again and lo and behold again the touch screen hardly to use. This was due to the fact that a thin film is installed on the front of the touchscreen on the case. This film is fully glued to the edge and quite difficult to remove. So the foil broken out and lo and behold the touch screen works perfectly.,4
3443,"The regular intake is to be observed, then you also notice a positive effect.",4
3444,A bit loud but at the price a hammer again and again like,4

3447,Needed a discreet shoe where you can wear a lot. This is very nice from wearing also by the soft sole. It rubs off a bit at first but also quickly settles down again. For the price completely fine,4
3448,Powerbank makes a pretty good impression. But had to realize at the first load that it only charges if it is in a fast charger. I also consider the capacity to be a rumor but is enough for me.,4
3449,"In principle, there is not so much to report. The pomade does what it should, holds well, looks good, smells good. I already had comparable products for a lower price, with which I was just as satisfied, that is, the one star deduction is only for the price / performance ratio. You definitely don't do anything wrong here, clear recommendation!",4

3454,"A really big set of keys. Where in the past the water pump pliers had to serve, I now have a suitable key. The only drawback is the holder, but I can overlook that. Price - performance fully in order. If you don't like to borrow tools from others, you need something like this. Absolute purchase recommendation!",4
3455,"The author succeeds again in telling new exciting stories around the main character. Nevertheless, the connection to the beginnings and to the people is preserved. I wonder if he can keep it up until the end.",4
3456,Good and solid looking product but the description for changing the numerical code is only in Chinese... But it worked.,4
3457,Filled the foot with sand instead of water. Gives a better stand and no problem with leaking. So far we are satisfied.,4

3459,"# Motivation for the purchase My daughter wanted a new diving mask with snorkel. # Scope of delivery and condition The mask came with loose snorkel, spare seals, holder for Gopro and a bag with closure. On the mask there are also 2 earplugs for which there are holders on the front of the mask. # First impression and workmanship The mask makes a very high-quality impression. Everything fits together very well, you have the feeling that someone has really thought about it when developing. The fit of the mask can be adjusted very well with the two wide rubber bands. # Conclusion After the first use in the swimming pool, my daughter (10 years old) says: ""I think the mask is very good, it only presses strongly against the face under water."" I think that the mask is still a bit too big for her. During the whole time in the water, the mask has not tarnished. After swimming, the mask came to dry in her storage bag. # Rating: 4 stars because: My daughter showed up once and had water in her mask. Since I am not sure if the water has penetrated laterally into the mask or came through the snorkel, I can only give 4 stars so far. When we have gained more experience, we will supplement this review! # I am happy to answer any further questions. If this review helped them, then I would be very happy about a click on ""useful"", thank you!",4
3460,"Ordered the black case in L for a medium sized suitcase... Unfortunately, I did not take any measurements from my suitcase before and thought that it could fit like this. However, I would have ordered better XL. Although the cover is very elastic, it does not cover the entire suitcase. Otherwise very satisfied.",4
3461,The stand fully fulfills its purpose. Some of the school bags are designed in such a way that you can't put them down. Such a stand is definitely suitable.,4
3462,"The design is really very good and does not hang heavy with the ears. I found the size of the star a bit too big at first, but was very happy with it after wearing it once.",4

3466,"Makes the XR a bit more globby, it doesn't bother me. The corners are a bit thicker and hopefully also increase the protection. However, if someone should expect an ultra thin shell, I can not recommend that. Unfortunately, the camera and the flash is not cut out but a common ""hole"". Maybe it also has advantages because the flash ""has more space"".",4

3480,"The date display is almost unreagnisable without a magnifying glass, otherwise very sporty elegant watch with good wearing comfort.",4
3481,The hand cream is the best I've found in a long time. She's awesome. Absorbs immediately and you have velvety hands. Leaves no traces of grease. And the effect lasts for a very long time.,4
3482,"Beautiful cans, are definitely versatile. The lids are unfortunately a bit thin and could close a little tighter. But for the price it's really okay.",4
3483,Product delivers what it promises. Good cool swimming goggles. Headband is a bit short.,4
3484,"As expected, nothing special but for a holiday it is enough and then off to the bin",4
3485,Fits very accurately Light and Slim. Too bad that it is not available in black,4
3486,unfortunately the swimsuit was cut a bit too big I still kept it because it has a good fit and the back neckline is very well done,4
3487,tasted. :),4
3488,Fits well in the hand...,4
3489,"Easy processing with partially sharp edges, but the lamp does what it should! Would buy them again and recommend them. Value for money is right.",4
3490,The camera is easy to use for 4-year-olds. It's really just meant as a toy. The images are not usable. But the child was thrilled.,4
3491,"Great shoe, but small. I took one size bigger. You sit otherwise on the foot a little looser but not so bad",4
3492,"Unfortunately, the motifs in this issue are not as beautiful as in others ... a bit too mechanical for me and the loving mice are also not so often represented anymore... some motifs are very nice others again not but I think that's a matter of taste!",4
3493,Calendar is nice and colorful and clear. The calendar is used for daily scheduling.,4
3494,"Bought the reader here and as usual it was delivered a day later via Prime. Since it is connected to a PC that is operated with Windows 7, a driver had to be installed via the manufacturer's homepage. The total installation time including the installation of the driver was less than 20 minutes... so we can only recommend this card reader.",4
3495,"Have purchased several cameras for outdoor use, each with solar panel (the original from Reolink). Wanted to avoid cable clutter and tearing open the façade. Hence this peoduct. Very easy to install. Cameras and modules work in all weather conditions (snow is still to be seen). Construction/workmanship is compact and of high quality. Connections to Wi-Fi and smartphones are easy to make. The cable of the solar module is quite long, so that you have enough flexibility when attaching. The only weak point: The plug connection between the camera/battery and the solar panels could be better/more stable. So far, however, no problems, since the location is fixed. The app is easy to use. Resolution of the cameras is ok. So I'm satisfied with the acquisition.",4
3496,"Contrary to my expectations, the shaking hair works quite well, but it requires a bit of practice. After sprinkling, you should lightly tap your fingertips on the hair so that it spreads naturally, after which it can be fixed with hairspray. Amazon also has a special hairspray for this, which is better than with normal. As far as the color is concerned, I was very unsure, I ordered dark brown and black and combine both now. So the color fits me very well. However, you should not expect too much, with advanced hair loss this product can not help either.",4
3497,"It's a low-budget sci-fi horror movie from the '80s. If you like B-movies of this kind, you should watch them, if you don't like such movies better not...",4
3498,"The raffle holders are very noble and let the new curtains shine further. Didn't really get that with the turning of the tapes but knew me to have cut off these tapes, the magnet is very strong ubd so it also holds the curtains",4
3499,Lamp arrived on time and is well bright!,4
3500,"For my requirements, this measuring device is sufficient. Only a professional needs stronger equipment. So even as a layman I know a guide.",4
3501,"Currently, the given function is flawless. Ask again in ten years. Should there be any disturbances at an earlier stage, I will get in touch.",4
3502,"The small Groot flower pot is a real eye-catcher. And I like it very much. Unfortunately, it has a small hole, which unfortunately causes the water to leak out when watering. But this is no longer tragic, you can fix with hot glue.",4
3503,"What I like is that the device comes in a bag, so everything is in great hands. In terms of price, one should not expect a miracle weapon now. Training on the side is therefore mandatory if you want to shape your body. As a support to build muscle quickly, I think the device is helpful. My only criticism: The instructions could be more detailed. I had to try it out. Otherwise you can recommend the device.",4
3504,"The luminaire works exactly as described. he makes a good impression of quality. After dusk, the lamp glows dimly. As soon as a movement is detected, the light becomes brighter. The 180 lumens are enough to find the key at the front door. Unfortunately, the light as general lighting, e.B. a way, is a bit too weak.",4
3505,Nice bbq. Prospective buyers should inform themselves in advance. I can confirm all the results and recommend the grill. Size is great.,4
3506,"Qualitatively, it makes a very robust impression. However, I have not used it yet, unfortunately the paracord was missing but it was a normal extension, but is also okay. Fast delivery :-)",4
3507,"Could be 1cm wider, because when inserting the laptop it chafes on the zipper.",4
3508,"I did not notice a real effect in the self-test, and the taste of the capsule is in need of improvement",4
3509,"Beautiful pictures and also great light. Easy to adjust, lots of ringtones. Clock goes unfortunately too fast already 1 min after. But it doesn't bother, because my son always has that in mind :-)",4

3512,"Looks a bit cheap but works great, even outside on the balcony. Very comfortable from the sofa turn on all the lights.",4
3513,"Trap. Slightly larger. But that doesn't matter. I had her in the swimming pool for the first time today. I think they do what they should you run safer because you don't slip. And even in the water they feel good and do not disturb. They do not prevent slipping 100% but enough not to get eggs around anymore. I find it practical that you don't have to pull them on and off like flip-flops but can just leave them on. When they came they smelled strong chemical, they then put them in water longer after it was better.",4
3514,"Apparently, most of the reviews given here refer to another product, it is not a standing mirror with ten times magnification. This one is for mounting on the wall! The quality is very good for the price, the articulated arm is a bit heavy which can also develop to the advantage for a while because something like that is often used.",4
3515,The little thing has good quality and stable reception of the DAB+ transmitters. also from local radio stations!,4
3516,"Super soft, Very pleasant",4
3517,"Have served both Halloween and Christmas well. Batteries do a good job, only the brightness could be something better.",4
3518,"I chose the white version with additional center support because I have a larger screen. The assembly was fixed and good, only the center support could not be attached one hundred percent straight, which does not harm the function. Overall, the stand is chic and the two compartments offer additional storage space. But on closer inspection, it is noticeable on the edges that they are not completely cleanly processed and painted. Overall, however, a good product at a reasonable price.",4
3519,"Very good BUT you have to cope with the smell ... Amazing what you can do with the product: the first soap suitable for washing fine longer hair, antiseptic, re-greasing; well tolerated, everything is just the smell: My husband says it smells like cow patties and therefore I don't buy a new one; looking for an alternative The smell reminds of earth and rancid oil, mud Drying is not enough: it smells about 3 hours after",4
3520,"After I could not cope with the lamp, another model was provided to me by the dealer! Thank you!",4
3521,"Has fit,no errors nothing broken.good quality",4
3522,"The quality is not top, but the price-performance ratio fits. The individual elements are not uniformly painted, but are not visible at first glance and in the overall result. Otherwise, the clothes rack is really nice and stable",4
3523,"Used twice, is ok",4
3524,"Price-performance ratio I find very good, if you just want to get a little fitter again, for professional athletes, however, I think it is less suitable, because e.g. the strength setting at the highest level was still very easy for me. The functions are simply designed, you can see the approximate calorie consumption, pulse sensor and much more for my needs definitely enough only shortcoming it rattles a bit when driving faster... otherwise ok.",4
3525,"It is very good for my broken knee if I can jog through the water with my belt. Since I do not always want to use a belt from the indoor pool, I have now bought my own. It fully meets my requirements. I have to wait and see how long the retractable side panels last. Practical is the supplied net.",4
3526,"My daughter had discovered the bath balls in the drugstore and taken them with her. She had so much fun with it that we ordered two packs of three balls each directly via the Internet (we don't come to the drugstore that often). When the package arrived, you could directly perceive the intense smell of the balls (which was not the case in the drugstore). When I opened the packs, I had to realize: four of the balls look fine, one crumbled in the foil and one even opened the foil and the bath additive was distributed in the form of sand in the entire bag in which the cardboard boxes were additionally packed. This also explained the intense smell Therefore my tip: rather buy in a drugstore. The children will definitely have fun with it!",4
3527,Nice gift for your 12th birthday,4
3528,"The presentation (quality, print, drawings) are very good. Unfortunately, the small font is too strenuous to deal intensively with this work. I will return the paperback and try to buy a ""bigger"" version. Too bad, I was very much looking forward to the book during the Christmas season.",4
3529,"So far, the case makes a good impression. However, really little change fits in. Unfortunately had a little too much in it and immediately torn off the zipper. For people without change I think a great solution but the change compartment I find too small or unnecessary, because not much fits in.",4
3530,"fast delivery, unpacked as usual, connected, tried the part looks good, is just something else, actually there can not be much broken the price is already remarkable, however, if you take a closer look at the thing big problem is the installation location: as soon as some wind goes, you run after the drops, with a shower this has little to do",4
3531,"Comfortable fit, fits well on the body and keeps the hernia and the associated pain at bay. So I would have to cope well with this until the necessary operation and for the first time afterwards. The dimensions in the product presentation correspond exactly to the body measurements. Thank you",4
3532,For the price really totally okay,4
3533,"Also fits great on an older Laurastar ironing table. Due to the rigid cords, the cover is a bit difficult to attach from and back.",4
3534,"Ordered the suitcase for my summer vacation due to the good value for money in my opinion. On the whole, I am also satisfied with it. He gets the star trigger for the wobbly and rather cheap grip and the fact that he was unfortunately completely scratched after the first flight. The latter was already clear to me with the high-gloss paint. I would still buy it again because it is very large and very light.",4
3535,A good exciting film that does not correspond to the mainstream.,4
3536,For the price ok but catches quickly lint Had it washed now 3 weeks now but it has a few lint,4
3537,I wanted to take a look at some old hard drives and not spend too much money on them. This product fulfilled all my wishes. Only that all components are exposed could give a problem at some point.,4
3538,"Delivery good, function flawless. Nothing special, punches as expected without fringes or the like. Bought me for crafting purposes with thick cardboard",4
3539,"In my opinion, the stainless steel mesh is so thin that you had to be careful not to damage it during assembly. However, some threads were still torn afterwards. I think that the material is not suitable for a light shaft cover. Unless you rule out that it will never be entered. But how to remove the foliage? With the bee, it becomes very problematic. If I had known this before, I would not have ordered it.",4
3540,"Looks great. However, the suit (Gr.S) was much too far for me. And despite the width, little freedom of movement was offered in the shoulder joint - so not exactly ideal for swimming. Currently I weigh almost 60kg and am 1.75m tall.",4
3541,Nice big fountain for many people. Delivery was on time and without defect. You just have to be prepared for the fact that you need at least 500 grams of chocolate so that the well can run. But also very good to use for parties,4
3542,"I bought the balls to hang them filled on a Christmas present. I am surprised, although the contents had some weight, the balls did not open. In general, the workmanship was very good. A (half) star deduction because they break very easily.",4
3543,"Not a bad product, but swallows a lot of Zippo gasoline",4
3544,"Good trampoline. A lot of fun for my children (3.5 and 1.5). We don't use it as a ball pit. If you have space, you are better off with a separate ball pool. Otherwise we would have to rebuild several times a day.",4
3545,"The lamps have a great harmonious light. Unfortunately, 2 of them were defective, but these were exchanged quickly and cost-neutrally. Fast delivery and good customer service.",4
3546,"On our TV an HDMI input is defective, so we decided for this switch. The function and connection are simple. This gives you 3 more inputs for devices. With the included remote control you can switch to the respective ports. Among other things, we have connected the Nintendo Switch and a TV Box there. If we switch on one of the devices, the port turns on automatically. This works smoothly. The workmanship is also good. The part is quite small, can be easily hidden, if desired. Only the receiver for the remote control must be within range. I think it's a pity that a relatively short cable is enclosed with the power plug and the remote control has a range of just about 1 meter. That is not enough. We are lucky that we are not quite so far away and bending forward is enough. Overall, however, we are satisfied, because the switch works smoothly.",4
3547,"The watch is not too big for my narrow wrist. The bracelet fits very well and through the magnet it also holds. Comfortable to wear. The watch does what it is supposed to. It was important to me that I can read the whatsapp messages on the watch. Otherwise you can set several sports types, weather function etc. w fits everything.",4
3548,The shoe arrived directly the next day of the order. I have to say it fits perfectly and is really comfortable. But there is a star print for packaging... Since they did not come in a cardboard box but in a simple bag that was crumpled.,4
3549,Fits perfectly for any charging cable and takes up little space... with missing a switch to switch on a u off. I didn't consider it when ordering. But otherwise great,4
3550,Are great.. but still a bit too expensive,4
3551,"Black jackets, coats and jackets from my son are well packed in it. The plastic didn't grump either. However, the presentation here shows greater transparency. In fact, you have to open the bags to see which part is exactly in them. This is probably not necessary for differently colored garments. For black clothes I would buy other covers in the future.",4
3552,"hope it lasts a long time, have only cut 7 times on it so far, but makes a good impression",4
3553,"Not a very nice movie. What does this have to do with the little prince? For me, almost nothing. Was very disappointed. Have seen better movies.",4
3554,"Very nice calendar! Gloves are well made. Creeping animals (dogs, cats, etc., no big horses) and also MatchboxAutos fit into the bags. I am satisfied!",4
3555,"Fast delivery. Size package. But unfortunately, many pens warn broken broken. Pens are too suitable for children and too short. Unfortunately not what I imagined. Nevertheless, you can use very well. . For melt pictures....",4

3560,"The guitar holders attach well the two guitars I own; one guitar is a light acoustic, the other a heavy electric. In addition, the brackets look good and simple and bring out the guitars on the wall well. Due to the padding on the holder, the guitar necks are not damaged at all. The installation on the wall was quite easy and took about 20 min.",4
3561,"Everything as described, very good. Packaging but defective, fortunately the light was not defective. The lamp is very bright. Unfortunately, the mounted cable is tight, especially with the lamps with the length of 120cm. That the power cable comes out of the lamp quite at the end of the lamp and not in the middle, the length is decisive. With my other 60-er length, that was no problem. As before the ceiling cable is shortened, measure whether it is enough.",4
3562,but without which it would never work. that's such a part. . that's such a part. . that's such a part.,4
3563,"Text and photos were informative for me. If you want to know more about the Swiss stone pine, you can build on the basis of the small booklet.",4
3564,I bought it for my daughter because she liked it so much in therapy and because of it I ordered it for her,4
3565,My daughter was very happy about it. Good quality,4
3566,"Is visually ok., assembly is a bit difficult, little space available. For the price, however, it is OK.",4
3567,All the best. We and our son were very happy with the baking tray. He now also has the opportunity to bake something really good.,4
3568,"I usually only watch horror, sci-fi and thrillers... I thought I'd watch a nice family movie... I cried for 60 minutes. my God, is the movie sad! So for children it is certainly nothing...",4
3569,It's a nice idea and looks really good,4
3570,"I have now put the little guy into operation. After the first runs in random mode, I can only say that I am satisfied with the result until long. From the noise it is okay and even if you sit in the same room.",4
3571,Could be smaller in diameter for an infant. Not washable!!!,4
3572,"... therefore, I can not evaluate the advantages and disadvantages. At first glance, it makes a good impression. Delivery was fast. What I didn't like: the backpack was packed in a plastic bag (still ok) and a matching cardboard box... that would have been enough. In addition, it was once again put into an almost twice as large outer carton with each Menke filling paper. From my point of view, this is completely superfluous, makes a lot of additional waste and thus harms the environment.",4
3573,"Great sound, a bit bass-heavy for my taste, but otherwise only recommended",4
3574,For bright fabrics and simple motifs in order. Price is still a bit daunting to try. With the pictures you should make sure that they have a good quality.,4
3575,"Day indicator practical, jacks a bit fidgety, but wireless charging super",4
3576,"Pretty good, thinner and lighter than expected",4
3577,"For little money a super 3D glasses. Unfortunately, the quality of the frame is a joke. Well, that the temples are star is still fine. But the battery compartment is a joke. It can easily happen that a small piece of plastic breaks off at the lid and it no longer closes. I then solved this with a rubber band. Looks stupid but still works well. Star deduction because of the lid that breaks slightly.",4
3578,"We are generally well satisfied with the MAM brand, including the pacifiers. They are well received, it is nice that the child can use them from both sides. The only negative thing is that you can't attach them anywhere (pacifier chain etc).",4
3579,"I bought this case to bring out my RGB lighting. I was looking for a white case with TG disc and until the date of purchase, the NZXT S340 Elite was the case that met this criterion most. Only the black edge on the TG disc bothers me a bit, but otherwise the case looks really great. From the equipment I would say: is OK. There are no dust filters, at least the front can be equipped with a 360mm radiator, the fans I have replaced with others, the cable management is fine, the air intake at the front could be better (the aperture is rather suboptimal). I deduct a star because a screw attachment to the TG has broken off. But otherwise I can recommend the case quite well .... if it weren't for the Define R6 White TG :D ) With some white spray paint for the front of the Define R6 White TG I have found the perfect white housing for me)",4
3580,"For personal use (not everyday) OK, price very good",4
3581,"The product has practical dimensions and looks very stable. The wall mount could be more robust. So far, everything is holding up great. Have them in operation every day. Rolling up works very well and a hand shower is also included.",4
3582,"Fast delivery, unfortunately a short instruction manual is missing, but was also so easy to attach with the attached cleaning agents. However, the touch sensitivity of my S9 is not set via advanced settings, but via settings/display/touch sensitivity, and reacts fine. The glass pastes perfectly with my phone case and, if you don't know it, does not notice it at all.",4
3583,"We were very curious if they are really as great as everyone writes. We can say they feel like a 2nd skin and you don't notice anything at all. However, the seat was a bit too loose, which gradually slipped away. It could be a bit tighter at the top. Why 1 star deduction",4
3584,"Beautifully processed, no rough, sharp-edged spots or splinters. Minus point: Some guests at my party complained about the mouthfeel. The wood dries out the mouth and has particularly irritated the lips and corners of the mouth. Some then switched to other cutlery.",4
3585,"Tested in three degrees and light wind, really good, warm and felt pull on the bike. But why do I need two if I only have one head?!",4
3586,"Very nobly packaged, a nice selection of tea and quantity corresponds to quality. Purchase recommendation 👍🏻",4
3587,"Beard oil in itself not bad only the problem is the bottle. After less than 2 days, the lid of the bottle is broken. Seems to have been a mistake in the production. Personally, I find the smell a little too mild but everyone should decide for themselves.",4
3588,Made tomato juice,4
3589,"With the Canon EOS 350, it has often happened to me that my eyecup has completely fallen off. This holds better than the original on the camera, but unfortunately in this model the rubber pad detaches from the eyecup. I glued it back on before it was completely torn off. I would say a cheap alternative, but unfortunately it is not as durable as the original.",4
3590,"I am actually very satisfied with the distributor, only the supply line is a bit short (therefore a star deduction). Also great with the voltage display. Would buy it again.",4
3591,"In itself a great product and the pressure is in my opinion higher than e.B with comparable products that you can buy at Saturn and similar shops. Cleaned my PC and keyboard with it which worked great. But unfortunately the black lids of all three cans were broken and torn, which of course does not affect the function of the product but is only a blemish. Overall, I can recommend this whole thing and just hope that the lids are whole next time, then there are also 5 stars. Good luck",4
3592,"We also work a lot outside in winter. We ordered the cap to have our hands free, but still enough to see when it is already dark. The cap is well made and keeps you warm in slight sub-zero temperatures. The LED lighting at the front of the envelope is nice and bright and comes from 5 small bulbs. The battery compartment sits directly on the cap under the envelope. Here come 2 CR2032 batteries in (available cheaply in a pack of 8 at the large furniture store). It is well tight, but without any rubber seals. I hope the cables and the battery compartment can withstand rain in the long run. The cap itself sits totally comfortably, it does not press anything. A great thing to keep both hands free, but still have enough light. When changing the battery, this is really helpful.",4
3593,Great motif and the mini LEDs look better than expected. Well processed and the battery box is hidden in a compartment where it does not interfere with filling. Deduction is only available because the stocking was a bit huge. Otherwise there is nothing to expose.,4
3594,"The CD is really nice but unfortunately it has a small scratch. Since the CD is for a gift, I am disappointed that something",4
3595,I am satisfied!!! Thank you,4
3596,"A very nice addition to the dirndl, good quality and fits very well. I can only recommend as a second blouse",4
3597,Very nice colors whereby the blue unfortunately runs extremely also here is the question of how the color was made. There is no information on this. Would advise against using blue and black especially for allergy sufferers!,4
3598,Installed in the garage. Good material. Easy to attach. Lid could open further,4
3599,"Inexpensive, visually good",4
3600,It is ideal if you have a flower light that can be pulled down for watering,4
3601,Tempered glass was delivered quickly and well packed. It is easy to attach but unfortunately there is always a surface at the edge where the glass does not sit on correctly. But otherwise everything top. For comparatively little money a good protection for the mobile phone.,4
3602,"Is a great combo to work with. The keystrokes are very dull and therefore quiet. Since both mouse and keyboard are very heavy, they are not so well suited for gaming. That's why the two of them go back with me.",4
3603,"The pleat has a very good quality and is also easy to assemble. Goes easier with 2 men, but is also possible alone.",4
3604,"My son is happy to finally have ""Lego"" dinosaurs. The quality is not comparable to the original, one or the other head likes to fall off and a few legs sit too loosely. But this sometimes leads to funny game situations - my son doesn't mind :)",4
3605,Shoulder buttons make fabric protrude slightly; otherwise nice romper with wide seams. Fabric feels soft. Cut is just right for thick diapers,4
3606,"The cage is fine. Unfortunately, 1 food bowl and 1 water bowl broke the plastic during delivery. I hope for a replacement delivery.",4
3607,"I am so far satisfied with the glasses. There are certainly higher quality swimming goggles, but not at this price. The swimming goggles are very easily adjustable and fit well. However, the sealing decreases a little with longer swimming time (about 2 kilometers). But I don't think it's bad, just re-adjust and move on :)",4
3608,"Very nice the numbers nice and big can be seen well. Unfortunately, the numbers are slightly larger than the letters. was super fast there again and again gladly",4
3609,"The shade sail makes a quite positive impression after unpacking, the fabric looks very durable and the seams are cleanly processed. The corresponding rods are functional. Included in the scope of delivery is a assembly manual, cords and herring, which is very positive. Time will tell how long the shade sail can withstand outdoors. But worth buying for this price!",4
3610,"fast delivery, product made of soft material, support work limited, but injuries very low",4
3611,"Gave my Mac Mini a second hard drive. It all worked out very well. However, I did NOT use the tool sent with, had my own bits for it. However, the rubber nipples, the flex cable and the ""slider"" for the board have done their job. From the P/L ratio, the 9 € are quite steep, therefore 1 star deduction. If you order from a China dealer (also via Amazon) you pay only 3.50 €. but who - like me - is impatient can confidently access here.",4
3612,"Super sweet and soft. Unfortunately, no uniform size",4
3613,"For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+ you should definitely get a case. I recently liked cases in which you can also insert the credit card. This is what the cover here offers. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid is a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks noble. In contrast to many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only on the connections are recesses. Otherwise, you can operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides well through the case. The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. Even on the QI charging station made of leather from TORRO it does not work. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made !",4
3614,"I have already read various things about ""Intermittent Fasting"". With this book you get a very good overview, especially about the health benefits. What I miss is how to deal with it, e.B. on vacation, or after long, partly humid evenings with friends. I have the feeling that it just doesn't happen and that social life takes place in the office or during running training. Therefore only 4 stars.",4
3615,"Works well, runs very quietly, just a little small.",4
3616,"If you have thought carefully that it should be a 60l, it is a visually appealing aquarium. Workmanship is good. The furnishing is slightly more complicated, because semi-circular, a traditional basin is there if necessary. also better for the fish. The filter and the lamp work almost silently. The fish used in the meantime (max. 20) seem to feel quite comfortable.",4
3617,Very crumpled and with stains,4
3618,It took a few days for my little ones to get used to it. Now they can't get out---,4
3619,Nice miniseries. I find Kai Giesinger super convincing in his role. But let's be honest.. this intro is sometimes gruesomely bad and annoying.,4
3620,"Great for the price. It looks nice and fits in the bathroom. Some things fit in and you can close the baskets. No smell, nothing defective!",4
3621,"Easy to install and fulfills its purpose, magnets close really well ....",4
3622,"The mobile phone is well made, quite clear and user-friendly designed. However, since the instructions written in micro font are not always useful, you have to get into certain settings first. I bought the product for my over 80-year-old father and explained everything to him. He alone would probably have been overwhelmed with getting to know the mobile phone on the basis of the instructions. The value for money is good overall.",4
3623,The book was better.,4
3624,"The book light is an eye-catcher, all guests are thrilled, me too. Operation very easy just open and done. Charging is also super easy with the existing USB cable. Cover made of wood, not plastic.",4
3625,"Optics and sound are great. Is very high quality processed and simply looks noble. A battery would still be the crowning glory, that bothers me personally but a bit in retrospect. But you actually know that beforehand.",4
3626,"Is reasonable to the price, had expected more",4
3627,"The bowl pad serves its purpose. It is non-slip and has a good size, so that two bowls can also be placed next to each other on it. Unfortunately, the underlay still smells. I hope the smell disappears over time. Then I give five stars!",4
3628,Tasks varied,4
3629,The device is very small and works. Unfortunately you have to pick up the software first by download which is not a problem but the link is quite difficult to type with the many parameters.,4
3630,"The lamp is very stable, the cable unfortunately hangs ugly at the back. The remote control works very well and is very convenient. The light can be aligned very arbitrarily, the twistable arm does a lot. The light itself is not as bright as I expected at the highest level, so a total of only 4 stars (also because of the cable).",4
3631,"The rosin is of the simplest kind, but quite usable",4
3632,"My mom was very happy about it, the sections are not too small. She can give free rein to her creativity in her choice of colour. The book was there quickly and securely packed. Would order again. When Mom is done, she gets a new one.",4
3633,"however, 1 star deduction, as the material could be a bit denser.",4
3634,The eyelash pliers have a good quality and they work great. It feels good in the hand and the eyelashes can be easily and easily shaped upwards.,4
3635,"Hello, 1 week camping was fun. The setup is a bit difficult, but after that the fun is guaranteed. In case of heavy rain, the seams would have to be sealed a little more densely. Space without end.",4
3636,The device does what it promises and is very accurate with its 3 dB tolerance. I use it e.B. to measure the volume of my car. It showed me the same volume that I reached in a professional measurement.,4
3637,"Nice design, our cats love it, the sisal could be a bit more sturdy, but good",4
3638,"I bought it mainly at home renovation. It cannot handle particulate matter. Filter closes after a few minutes and the suction power gives up sharply. Filter cleaning doesn't help either. You have to disassemble again and again, clean filters, reassemble them. It is large and very robust. Has decent suction power. I would only recommend to a limited extent.",4
3639,"The shelf fits in just about any closet. It consists of many individual parts, which can be assembled according to your own wishes. Since the material does not look particularly valuable, I unfortunately have to deduct a star. Nevertheless, I can recommend the product.",4
3640,"The print result is slightly paler than with brand cartridges. However, if you do not need professional printouts, you will be very satisfied with the result and the price-performance ratio.",4
3641,"Pillow pushes through a bit, so the original shape is then obsolete. Otherwise, there is nothing to complain about.",4
3642,"Beautiful piece of jewelry, looks noble, although it was rather cheap in price.",4
3643,"Everything is right about the figure. The foot is whole and there is no damage. The only point of criticism: no recommendation for the real collectors, as the packaging was totally in the bucket when the package was delivered.",4
3644,"I am convinced of the brand, not vegan",4
3645,"The product absorbs relatively quickly, does not smell unpleasant and, above all, creates a beautiful intimate environment. 👍",4
3646,"I ordered the mattress in hope that it would keep tight. Unfortunately, half of it was already out after the 2nd day. After that, however, it was strangely dense. The packaging is nice and small and handy. 4 stars!",4
3647,I like it! A bit stiff at first but that settles. Have been using it for some time now. Meanwhile already ordered for Mom & Grandma :-) It looks exactly like in the photo and it all fits in. Of course you notice the price by the quality but really great,4
3648,"I am satisfied with the coin case, the delivery was prompt and reliable. Could accommodate my coins in it well and clearly.",4
3649,"The leather wallet is very nicely processed and has a practical size, is rather a little smaller. The only drawback: The zipper always opens easily and thus small change falls out.",4
3650,"I really liked the many anchors. The size specifications are very vague... It's too big, but I don't think it's bad.",4
3651,"A great wallet. Unfortunately, the vehicle registration does not fit in. If you carry a lot of change with you, it is not necessarily ideal.",4
3652,fast delivery well packaged,4
3653,Exactly as described. Top,4
3654,The glasses are fine but are only given for the birthday and hope that they are well received. The delivery was made on time and to full satisfaction.,4
3655,For the price you can not complain,4
3656,"The shirt is a bit wider. Otherwise, I am very satisfied. The fabric feels pleasant to the touch. With the delivery it also worked out great.",4
3657,"The speaker connects quickly to Bluetooth devices and is therefore recommended. In addition, the speaker reaches up to 84 DB which is very convincing, but the sound is still great!",4
3658,"Very nice balloons that last a long time(still look top after 5 days). Unfortunately, the confetti balloons in the sun become white over time. But a star deduction. Otherwise, I am very satisfied.",4
3659,Unfortunately it didn't last long but for a short time the pond was clear 🥴,4
3660,"Looks simple, easy to clean, hygienic and resistant. Used for two toothbrush heads.",4
3661,"I usually wear size L in underwear and have ordered this underwear in XL based on the previous comments. Unfortunately, the legroom is significantly limited (going to the knees / tension on the thigh). Since the overall impression seems valuable, I will order this underwear in XXXL after return and give feedback on it.",4
3662,"Actually, I should only give a maximum of 3 stars, because the quality of the graphics is really scary and some missions can not be solved by bugs, at least not right away. So why 4 stars? Because I just had a lot of fun playing to the end. Despite the miserable graphics",4
3663,A star deduction because the touch screen does not work quite as well but otherwise 👍🏻,4
3664,"Got charger from you. However, without description. Please reply. Thank you in advance. Best regards: Jürgen Huhn",4
3665,"I finished the picture, it is wonderfully beautiful but that there was only one brush to it was not so nice because it was not a high-quality brush. I had to order frames separately and now it hangs in my office.",4
3666,Initially a bit unusual in the operation. We got used to each other and I'm happy with the performance.,4
3667,"The owl with the bump, a story that is often heard here and the songs in between, we also find great. The only thing we don't like is that the beginning begins with who reads it aloud and who the publisher is. Luckily you can also fast-forward but it's still annoying. But we would buy the Tonie again.",4
3668,Delivery just in time. The machine meets my expectations. I am therefore very satisfied.,4
3669,"I'm actually satisfied with the product. Have long thick hair and once you get the hang of it, the Dutt fits perfectly. Unfortunately, the two are broken quite quickly with me and no longer work. Nevertheless, I will order them again.",4
3670,"Delivery not at the specified time, item good and according to the offer, bag rather large, color top, elaboration good, quality good",4
3671,"Have acquired this Holy Mary to give away. The figure is kept in white and very detailed as well as well processed. The material makes a high-quality impression. Looks really pretty. The delivery took place 1 day after order and well packed, which is why the Maria arrived unscathed. The gifted one was very happy. Purchase recommendation.",4
3672,"Visually super beautiful! Personally, I find the glass a bit thin... I'm always very careful.",4
3673,"Nice bag/backpack, but in one place the seam is unprofessionally processed. This is on the back, where you carry the backpack on your back and here (apparently) the seam breaks first. Because the price is ok, I will keep the bag.",4
3674,"the case is nice. easy to assemble. Unfortunately, my SSD is not recognized via USB. I can't find a reason. SSD is not defective.",4

3677,"I bought the USB-C adapter for my 2019 iMac 27"" 5k to connect a 2002 (I think) Apple Cinema Display. Works perfectly with sleep and wakeup, the only point of criticism is a relatively thin purple stripe on the left edge of the display. I would recommend in principle, if the (depending on the display) inconspicuous bar does not disturb.",4
3678,In itself super but without cloth bag contain u d the damper we have disposed of first much too heavy and noisy. My husband installed another damper and mounted a cloth bag from the old laundry basket.,4
3679,Very good execution the lienen and angles of the wind rose could be even more accurate and a marking where above is helpful. But otherwise flawless.,4
3680,"Very entertaining story and insights into life at that time, which was very difficult for young people. I liked it.",4
3681,I really like the cover! My only flaw that the opening is relatively small that you have to squeeze the pillow in but it fits.,4
3682,The lights arrived on time as usual and the installation went smoothly. B,4
3683,"the insulating tape does not stick as tightly as I expected, therefore only 4 stars",4
3684,The socks are of very high quality. Very nice colors to choose from. Can you buy without hesitation also I would buy these again.,4
3685,"Fast delivery, perfect fit. Look good. The woven logo in the calf area is not ideal. It leaves ONE distinct imprint on the skin. The shelf life cannot be evaluated after 2 weeks of use. But I would possibly get another pair.",4
3686,"Very nice bottle! Nice for small children, for school. Can not break optimally for children.",4
3687,"Inexpensive charger, works, although not quite as simple and light as the original, but suitable as a second device.",4
3688,This is already our second doctor's case and only recommended for playing. The quality of the instruments is really great. 2 are even equipped with a lamp (fever meter and tooth mirror). The stickers must first be glued on. A small drawback is that you can no longer close the suitcase with the attached side work surfaces.,4
3689,was delivered quickly after problems due to incorrect delivery,4
3690,"... however, the studs are tiny (diameter 7 mm). The chain is not as delicate as in the picture, but for the price I did not complain about it. The pendant has a diameter of 1 cm. However, both ear studs and pendants each appear about 2 mm smaller, as only individual petals reach the respective overall size. Therefore, in my opinion, this jewelry set is only suitable for small children or very slim adults.",4
3691,"Is smaller than expected, I am 1.68m and weigh 58kg, I am quite slim, but size M was too small. Overall, however, a nice jacket, the hood is bigger than necessary, the great thumb holes make up for it.",4
3692,Tastes pleasantly of butter and thus combines the positive properties of rapeseed oil and the taste of butter. Can only recommend it. Only the price seems quite high to me.,4

3697,"I've never been so blown away by whether I liked the end of a book. I wished so much for a different one and yet I can understand why it has to end like this. Like volumes 1 and 2, I also devoured volume 3. I finally wanted to know what all this was all about. We dive deeper and deeper into the story, which makes us begin to understand more and more. Most of all, I wanted to solve the mystery of the witch hunter. I must confess, however, that I was disappointed in one and the other chapter of Lilith. Even if she realizes her mistakes, I still have not been able to forgive her completely. All in all a really great story that is amazing to read! PS: This is my first recession, so forgive me if it is still expandable.",4
3698,"The quality of the LEDs overall is very good. The color temperature is right and so is the luminous efficacy. Really very good LED's. The durability is OK, but also no more. Three LEDs are broken after about 1.5 years - but thanks to Amazon this was not a big problem and was refunded. So here, as always, everything is fine. Overall therefore 4 stars: ++ Price ++ Light intensity and light temperature ~ Durability overall okay (3 out of 10 after 1.5 years defective) --> Amazon has replaced here but without hesitation!",4

3701,"So far it's quite ok. Not like in the pictures, despite my thick cornea, but my feet have already become softer after the first time apply, but I use them once a month and maybe I will soon have more beautiful feet without cornea. In any case, a pleasant scent even after days.",4

For the reason 1 point deduction. otherwise this part is just great and I would get it again and again!",4
3705,Good material good quality and lasts longer than I thought and for this price is ok,4

3709,"The delivery took place overnight. The arrows were ordered with 18g. to play on an e-dart. The delivery was made in a sturdy plastic box, but the arrows can no longer be stored in it after complete assembly. The arrows make a valuable and good impression. Lie well in the hand, but the barrel may be a little more ribbed for my taste. The supplied black plastic tips (long/short) bend quickly and break off and are qualitatively nothing special. Therefore, I recommend ordering corresponding replacement tips at the same time. The supplied wings (different sizes) sit securely in the shaft. Summary: With good plastic tips it is fun to dart.",4
3710,"A very nice throw, the fabric really feels like suede. Unfortunately, the back is very smooth, so that the throw on the sofa slips with every movement. Would be great if that would be changed.",4
3711,very clear and practical,4

3717,"The panties were delivered quickly. I had opted for the variant with red. However, I was sent a variant with pink, which is really not my color, I'm not a Barbie ;-) I then contacted the seller and sent pictures. It was very very customer-friendly and I was sent 2 panties of the red version. Although the one not with black lace, but I see over it, because the concession was first cream. I was told that the picture was wrong, maybe this will be changed in a timely manner ;-) The panties are very comfortable to wear, you hardly notice them. However, I recommend washing them in a laundry net, as the tip unfortunately pulls threads quickly. Therefore, 1 point deduction. If you don't expect extremely high quality now (which should be logical at this price) then you can treat yourself to some cute panties. I would buy them again.",4
3718,Works as described so far,4
3719,Articles are readily recommended,4
3720,"I liked the alarm clock very much visually, because it does not look like an alarm clock at first glance. I was particularly interested in it in white, due to my interior and the colorful display shown here, but it only shines white. In addition, it still shines very brightly, despite the possibility of adjusting the brightness. Not in the height of the bed, but lower it should not disturb. There is a description, which is not perfectly understandable in german, but you get the most important thing like setting the alarm clock. How the voice control works, however, I have not yet fully under seen, so I would like more explanation. It can be operated with 3 small batteries or with a cable. However, I prefer batteries, so he can still wake me up despite a power failure. All in all, I am satisfied, but as mentioned a better explanation would be nice and possibly. a way to turn the lighting on or off by touch, as it is quite bright.",4
3721,"Nice box, great layout, mega colors. Is very practical because you can put the parts individually in the dishwasher. A star deduction as it is difficult (for children) to open and close them.",4
3722,"The foil was easy to glue on and fits perfectly 👍🏻, I am very satisfied with it you can definitely recommend",4
3723,You can definitely watch the film. :),4
3724,"very nice bracelets. It would be advantageous if you can choose different lengths. For my wrist, the size is a bit tight",4
3725,Display too dark in daylight.,4
3726,German? Classics - just find the book class and should be given even today's children in times of too much political correctness to read!,4
3727,"Delivery was dropped off in front of the door, had to carry it up itself on the third floor. Otherwise goods were good.",4
3728,We are very very satisfied and are very positively surprised. Price performance ratio fits in any case. We recommend it in any case,4
3729,"Fast delivery, the goods were no return, newer, item, generally satisfied.",4
3730,"It all worked out well! Shipping went smoothly. Everything arrived on time and well packed. Therefore, the vote is good",4
3731,"works perfectly, German instructions not unbdingt necessary.",4
3732,"We made the bed linen right after receipt, it is nice and soft and looks well made.",4
3733,"Although hard drive is very large and requires a power supply, it is therefore less suitable for portable use. Connected it to my Playstation 4 and it works perfectly, very fast processes, easy handling. Super device for little money!",4
3734,"Very potent booster which is no wonder with the ingredients. Nevertheless, there is a point deduction because the ingredients shown here do not correspond to what is then in the can.",4
3735,A bit too small she imagined me bigger!,4
3736,"There are many turning points that made the story super exciting, but also gap fillers that you did not need. I hope that this will be improved in the second part.",4
3737,"With these patches I sleep longer and deeper and my feet are fresh longer! Why I don't give full stars: one pack completely lacked the description, the other pack had a spelling mistake in it. Since I had ordered it as a Christmas present, I wrote a description myself from the Internet.",4
3738,"Machine is very quiet and in itself also makes a very nice cut. However, is more suitable for light fur without undercoat. The batteries have a minus, they no longer charge as well as at the beginning, the red lamp starts to flash after 10 minutes landing.",4
3739,"This is a soldies product, which I like very much. I like to wear it and have also bought it from my partner.",4
3740,For my standards a top mobile phone.,4
3741,Good and exciting film.,4
3742,"I wanted to have such a mirror before, in which you can store your jewelry. This jewelry cabinet offers a lot of space for necklaces, bracelets and rings. Even small perfume bottles can be placed in the cupboard. It is also good that it can be completed. I can hang the mirror on the door, but unfortunately it no longer closes. Next week I will mount it on the wall as already described here.",4
3743,"the panties sit.however, you notice that the workmanship is not particularly high-quality.although it is not too tight when stretching the fabric the seams have a little gelöst.au sin addition, it rubs off.even after washing several times.therefore beware of the, otherwise it has unsightly stains. the size of the dildo is optimal for on the go. can be worn both vaginally and anally well.After some time, however, the somewhat stiff square on which the dildo is attached is somewhat disturbing... but at home I like to wear it when tidying up. also in combination with or love balls -depending on the type of wearing of the dildo;)a nice motivation...",4
3744,"I've been training with it for a few weeks now and really have the feeling that the EMS device brings something. To sit lazily on the couch I think it is rather nothing, you have to train already. And I have the feeling that the muscles are being used more and let's see what my stomach or arms will look like in a few months:) My boyfriend also has one and thinks it's great, he is also sure that it works and he will continue to use it... are curious whether he then gets defined muscles. We report!",4
3745,"The clamps are great for clamping two smaller workpieces over the corner. For me, the price-performance ratio is right here. I can recommend it.",4
3746,Very good lightweight bottle cage. Works perfectly. Not suitable for mounting behind the saddle. Bottles then like to slip out at potholes.,4
3747,"Fits very well, but is much smaller.",4
3748,"The kit is really good, all parts fit together well. Only the chains are a bit too unstable. The figures could also be a little more beautiful, but my children don't care.",4
3749,"This is cheap thing but is OK for dirty hands (gardening), but this will not last long. For this price well. I have been looking for a long time a nail, hand brush which does not lies on the sink.",4
3750,Super nice and modern. It is also very easy to use and an eye-catcher.,4
3751,"A bit exaggerated at first but on the whole a really funny movie. I wouldn't watch the movie again, but I would be very entertaining.",4
3752,"I think the device is good, but with the statement that it can also sharpen jumbo pens, I can not cope. How?! I may miss something, but I also couldn't find a way to contact the seller. Does anyone know, please? Thank you.",4
3753,Is fine Any time again,4
3754,I like the part fits well in every corner.,4
3755,Again a very well done Simon Stark story. I think the first parts are a bit better than the newer ones. But I was very well entertained and can recommend the book.,4

Different colors, are for different skin types : Black : For all those who are prone to impure skin ( acne ). White : For all skin types, even the sensitive ones. Green : For combination skin, with green tea opinion and conclusion : beginner's set, for an affordable price. Natural product, without chemicals, without animal suffering, absolutely vegan. Unfortunately, the announced hook was missing, which should be included as a gift, so there is a star deduction.",4
3757,Just as I imagined it. Our cats have the electric blanket in their outdoor cat house and at night I set the temperature to 30 degrees.,4
3758,"The delivery of the fragrance was well packed within a few days. The scent smells very pleasant and just two sprays are enough thick. Also, the scent can still be smelled after hours. If you are looking for an eau de toilette, which combines grapefruit, apple and lavender, this is the right place for you. I got the article uncalculated, in the course of an opinion study.",4
3759,I am satisfied with the Portmanee,4
3760,"Quality is good, the shoe is unfortunately a size too small have 46 but had to order 48/49 otherwise everything fits",4
3761,"Have personally promised me more of it but brings something. Qualitatively, you can't complain.",4
3762,The price-performance ratio of this product is right.,4
3763,"The cabinet is in the finished condition (with us at least) really nice, the wood was impeccable and looked very high quality. However, I can confirm that with the somewhat crooked drill holes and the very ""minimalistic"" instructions, if you have a talented craftsman at home, it is less of a problem, I and my left hands would probably have had to give up after some despair. Nevertheless, a nice closet for the money, but you should definitely bring some talent for building.",4
3764,"Good quality socks. fit very well, but slightly thin fabric which leads to rapid wear. More suitable for warmer days.",4
3765,"You notice very quickly that this controller is the much cheaper variant. However, it is better in the hand than the originals due to the size difference. They are a little more complex to connect",4
3766,"Great recorder for beginners. Including case, grease and cleaner. Sounds good.",4
3767,"Very thin material, good workmanship and modern design!",4
3768,I am very surprised by this part.small finely arranged.simple operation.simply great,4
3769,"I think the idea is really good, but you have to suck quite hard. I tried it myself and it's hard for me. Our little one can't do it. I think it's more for older children.",4
3770,"Lots of socks for little money. The product itself: - comfortable to wear - fit well / good fit (no excess fabric corners due to poor workmanship) - do not slide down, like some other socks Disadvantage: If you want to unpack them, you take your time. All socks together are in a plastic packaging. There are always two pairs clipped together several times and made together with a plastic thong. Not to forget the plastic hook. For commercial sales, the packaging makes sense; the private person needs patience and scissors when unpacking. One could have thought a little more about the environment and the time of the customers. Conclusion: Socks themselves: Clear purchase recommendation. One star deduction wg of triple packaging.",4
3771,"I opted for the more expensive version (real metal) whereby in retrospect the plastic is probably better and easier to process. The adhesive points are not optimally set here and thus not quite adjacent at both ends. P/L is unfortunately not good here, would not buy it again!",4
3772,"This is the second marten scare. Previously had the previous model. So far I am satisfied. Find the improvement of the fuse very good, as it is denser and easier to replace.",4
3773,"I wear the top very often and gladly because it is simple and therefore fits everything. The only negative is that the fabric does not protect a bit from the cold. For aesthetics, it is worthwhile not to use an undershirt",4
3774,"Very good and rustic work, but with the disadvantage that the grate falls off a little crooked towards the grill pan. So take care of sausages.",4
3775,Very nice pencil cases for all sorts of things... the felt just feels good and also looks chic... very practical for the tool case for small parts. I now use these pencil cases for my sunglasses - are great for that! Fits in perfectly and the glasses are optimally protected! That's why there are 5 stars *****,4
3776,"Very fast delivery. The plugs are nice. However, although I knew they were small, but very petite. Are great for the 2nd ear hole. That's why I bought them. Priced ok",4
3777,Fast delivery and so far super quality. The only thing I have to complain about is that the color is not as intense as in the pictures.,4
3778,"After years of neck problems and umpteen pillows, this time via Amazon.... I haven't regretted it. A great pillow. I found the smell very disturbing at first, but evaporates within a week. Also the washing of the pillow cover was not a problem, it survived washing and dryer. Can really only recommend it.",4
3779,"The product itself I quite okay, but not under a year. Since the area to chew is much too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it for the sake of size. Now with 12 months we have looked for him out again and he can use it. Has also not yet been able to bite anything with his already few existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot.",4
3780,Is ok for the price,4
3781,"A great thing in itself! Kelly Starret has it on it - you know that. However, I have a bit of a hard time with books. Based on the photos, it is not ultra clear to me how I should do the exercises now. I like the idea and think it's very important what he says: maybe first look at the foundation before you overload yourself.",4
3782,"If the iPad is well seated, it could be a bit flatter with all the flatness itself, but that almost does not disturb the usability. Is recommended!",4
3783,my husband uses these respirators and is happy with them,4
3784,"Good evening to everyone, in my opinion the turn signals have great colors (which certainly come into their own under water) and they look well processed and the hook is very pointed. I have some thoughts about binding the tendon blank to the turn signal, as I find the holes quite sharp-edged. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to test this product in practice, as it is just a grace period. The turn signals come in a pack of 5 and make a very high-quality impression, as well as the packaging. I have to say I think 20 € for 5 turn signals appear first as a proud price. I'm curious to see if/how they pay for themselves. I hope I could be of help to the one who reads this, in the decision. Greetings Marcel",4
3785,"Hello, I will be happy to let you know, was on the post today and the spice ball had not yet arrived. Maybe tomorrow or Monday. Expect them very much. J.",4
3786,"I bought it for my valuables, and I have to say I'm amazed. Crass safe the door holds and stable in any case.",4
3787,Very satisfactory,4
3788,"Very nice material. However, for babies very large. Rather something for toddlers or at the earliest from 6 months. Otherwise, the cloth replaces the top :) still keep",4
3789,Really makes a qualitative impression. I am very satisfied,4
3790,"actually you can't complain, but you think that different fishing to play arrive.",4
3791,"Slightly larger than the original battery. But it fits. Soldered flags a little too wide, can be easily made fit with scissors. Therefore, a point deduction. Toothbrush works great again. Clear recommendation. Repair instructions abound on the Internet.",4
3792,For the price I would order the top again and again. Really pleasant fabric. I'm not quite as thin as the one in the photo so the top is a bit shorter for me. But all in all good. Ordered size S. Would order M next time.,4
3793,Good value for money,4
3794,"Cute follower, bought it as a small addition to a birthday present for a globetrotter. For the price completely o.k.",4
3795,Is just the right thing for a wedding gift... Well made...,4
3796,"The booklet is relatively thin and there are really only recipes in it, black on white. No pictures, made without love... Therefore, there is a star deduction! Otherwise a good book.",4
3797,It is a little too short for me personally. But in itself a great product :) Writing did not go off even during repeated washing and does not peel off at corners. Let's see what it looks like in a few months :D,4
3798,"Shipping costs to Austria are damn expensive. As a result, I pay the same as in the hardware store, which means that ordering almost no longer pays off.",4
3799,Good cast but still a bit lengthy the film,4
3800,"In itself, I find it beautiful and am satisfied with the fast shipping and the good packaging. After I screwed the parts together, the paint has come loose in some places and you can see green paint underneath. I helped with a black Edding and now you don't see anything anymore. It smells like chemistry, but I think that evaporates after a short time. Nevertheless, there is a point deduction. However, the boards are quite well made and there are no unsightly / uneven places. I still like it quite well.",4
3801,"fast delivery, as beach sheets.",4
3802,"goods were well packed, also the individual liquids were in their own plastic packaging, originally sealed. the liquids themselves are a matter of taste....",4
3803,Delivery as far as in order. Is intended as a gift. So I can't say anything more about it yet.,4
3804,A good swimming aid also for smaller children.Can be recommended.,4
3805,"The inflating with the small pump was a bit tedious, price-performance ratio is right. How the seat cushion helps in the long term, I can not say at this time.",4
3806,"When opening the bag, an unpleasant smell of grapes came directly towards me, which really put me off at first. I briefly thought about whether this was right and whether I should try it at all. In terms of taste, however, I was very surprised by ""Moringa Smoothie Powder"". It tastes very sweet and has a really pleasant vanilla taste. It does not dissolve completely in cold milk, but with prolonged mixing in the blender, this was no longer a problem. It does not clump together again and keeps you full much longer. I will definitely continue to use it and maybe try it in other forms than just dissolved in cold milk.",4
3807,Exciting and sometimes something different. The film is definitely worth seeing therefore 4 stars from us. Have fun watching.,4
3808,I'm really excited about the design. The rotation function really makes a lot of sense and everything is accommodated in one place. Arrived pretty well at our party.,4
3809,"Delivery has arrived after 2 days. Very handy and lightly packaged. For the construction I needed 1.5 h, but have ZERO talent in it, so is well feasible for every girl. You just have to read the instructions carefully, think logically and have a little strength for putting them together. Once it was fully assembled, it was very stable. A star trigger, as a plastic part is immediately torn.",4
3810,"Function absolutely great, together build well, especially since you have to move the running rails to get to the screw holes, and without the lever it is really hard, otherwise if you have made it then, top product just horny",4
3811,Very fast delivery.. Super...,4
3812,"The beanie is well made and visually as in the picture the colors match. Unfortunately, however, they are a bit tighter than expected.",4
3813,Shipping was fast. A lot of bursts in the pocket despite everything there is a point deduction. The long handle is attached to the bag with an oring in a leather loop and this leather loop is unfortunately not so stable is already torn with me,4
3814,"Good quality, but not suitable for the Paperwhite, although it was displayed as an ad under the Paperwhite... (In such a comparison table)",4
3815,"The holder does what it should, easy to install and well processed. Stainless steel screws with two different lengths are included. A battery light is easy to attach and does not interfere with the handlebars. When driving over uneven ground, the holder vibrates slightly, due to lack of stiffness. However, this does not offer any disadvantage in the function. Purchase recommendation!",4
3816,"The karaoke microphone was a gift, would be tried immediately and was very well received.",4
3817,Does his job well so far.,4
3818,"When buying, I did not pay attention to the fact that they are rags / cloths and not washing gloves. Nevertheless, these cloths are good and do not tear when used.",4
3819,I have square plates and bowls that don't hold quite as well - but still the draining rack is practical and helpful.,4
3820,Very good book to start with. Also the poster with the individual foods is great to hung up in the kitchen. I also think it's great that the book is not so dogmatic but very realistic.,4
3821,"After a short cleaning of the glass, the application of the protective film worked immediately without bubbles etc. At first glance, it is not recognizable that a protective film is applied to the mobile phone. You might think that the film is a bit too thick, but due to the perfect fit without inclusions, this is not a defect. I can recommend the slide without restrictions. Very easy installation, no bubbles! I directly pulled the foil from the new phone and it immediately on it and it became bubble-free by itself. Would buy it again in a time!",4
3822,The elephant is really great. He was/is a nice surprise for my daughter! Would wish if the elephant would also be available on German and maybe a little quieter!,4
3823,"The razor and trimmer does what it should and has been living with us for 3 years now. Unfortunately, the MM display shifts more often so it is difficult to get consistent length",4
3824,Fast delivery. Fits exactly.,4
3825,But unfortunately does not last long,4
3826,"I am happy about the beautiful pictures, and about James . May they have many more beautiful years together.",4
3827,Convenient to give away sweets,4
3828,Quick build up Price fits Stable is the bed also,4
3829,"Super fast shipping and for the price the quality is fine. However, fabric could be a bit thicker.",4
3830,Very fast delivery and everything as described. Very soft and easy to wash.,4
3831,"According to my daughter great, but slip down easily sometimes. Overall impression good - gladly again. Delivery could run a little faster.",4
3832,"The device was delivered quickly. The first test was positive, the device is easy to use. There is a star trigger for the poorly operated switch from ""cooling"" to ""heating"". This control panel is something leading precision mechanics such as watchmakers or jewelers. The big advantage: an analog device that does not require batteries and does not have to be reset even after a long power failure",4
3833,"Nails are ok, stable and hold well. Unfortunately, but very very long.",4
3834,"The books are quite good, but after a while it is annoying that these certain scenes, i.e. the intimate ones, start the same way over and over again. You like to skip them. Otherwise, I found the story quite exciting.",4
3835,"I think color and material are excellent! Just as I imagined it. It also encloses the edges and corners sufficiently, but both the volume buttons and the on/off button are completely enclosed by the cover, which I personally do not like so much unfortunately. Otherwise, however, the feel is very high-quality!",4
3836,inexpensive and works,4
3837,"The tempered glass of was easy to attach to the screen, has a secure adhesion and does not affect the touch. So far only good experiences with the product collected.",4
3838,My daughter likes it and plays with it. She was delighted.,4
3839,Delivered quickly! Nice jacket. This is how you want a customer service,4
3840,Very stable and cushions well when falling fits also exactly like original Apple cases unfortunately it gets brown very quickly what you can no longer get clean even with bleach or chlorine cleaner not :( otherwise very satisfied :),4
3841,"In itself a very modern floor lamp. It doesn't have a really firm stand, but that doesn't bother me anymore because it's in the corner. I find dimming via the power button a little tedious. I expected a little more from the brightness itself. It will definitely be kept, as we like it very much from the optics",4
3842,The smart socket does not buzz weird or similar and works well so far. Delivery and packaging flawless. The corresponding app I find only super confusing and stupid made!,4
3843,"Very good image quality, very sound could be a bit richer, sounds very metallic but is not bad. The workmanship is good and looks rubust. The battery keeps what it promises. For 99 eu a great hands. For playing with large memory usage, the device with 3gb of RAM is more than sufficient. Conclusion: buy a second one for my wife.",4
3844,"Expected more! But all in all, it's ok! Don't knock me off my stool!",4
3845,"Very comfortable, looks super nice and you don't have flat breasts like other sportsbhs. The straps at the back don't look super made, but you don't see that when you wear it. I am very satisfied and can only recommend the purchase.",4
3846,"Works great as a power bank, as a hand warmer only conditionally, because not hot enough.",4
3847,we scratched the parts to be able to paint them green,4
3848,Fits quite well hab was the 8er but also goes for it even if it could have been money in my opinion,4
3849,"In fact, my hair has become softer as a result, but it feels kind of stubborn and unfortunately my scalp has also started to itch :/ The scent is okay, but also disappears quite quickly. All in all, everyone has to test for themselves whether it is good for them or not",4
3850,"Had one of SPIGEN before and it was nothing. Sharp edges and thus poor haptics. This one is great, very thin and not disturbing in operation.",4
3851,"The belts are functional. The upper is soft, but whether it is genuine leather, I'm not sure. The smell is very chemical and quite strong. Unfortunately, the edge bezel is made with a cheap-looking, quite stiff material. This is disappointing and unfortunately does not make the product really high quality. Functionality is given, the Velcro closes neatly and is sewn cleanly.",4
3852,We at home have used the fish pan several times and are very happy with it.,4
3853,"Very practical, especially when using cloth diapers. Suitable for Calvin Klein. Unfortunately not suitable for Steiff and Ralph Lauren or Tommy hilfiger. Therefore, unfortunately, another set had to be bought. Instead of three times the same push button size, the set with three different sizes would make more sense.",4
3854,I am completely satisfied.,4
3855,"The fan fully fulfills its purpose. If man wants to be critical, maybe there could be a little more wind. Otherwise really good, everything as described",4
3856,"The laundry box is nice and big and also very robust, the only thing that is a bit annoying is that the lid is not attached to the box and thus sometimes lies crooked on the box. But since that doesn't bother me, I would buy this laundry box again at any time",4
3857,"Installation easy, also suitable for ceiling mounting. But just then, the extremely short connection cable stands out negatively, here the merchants could have given the technicians a few cents more. But a star deduction. Function is good, range better than expected, setting is child's play.",4
3858,"Legally sufficient to secure my front loaders against ""removal"". Price ok, processing ok, quickly delivered. Would definitely buy a second one!",4
3859,"Works great. However, the transparent covers are probably stiffer. They didn't adapt well. The color selection is also great.",4
3860,"I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I received as a giveaway, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I shcon fell into the shower), plays bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Suction cup must of course be watered, otherwise it will dissolve. it can play sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is played back as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing almost hurt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible well enough. My old speaker didn't play bass well as bass, but the frequencies were displayed quite naturally in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. That's why I have to subtract a star. I expected more from the frequency response.",4
3861,"Fast delivery, the bag looks exactly like in the photo. It does what it is supposed to and is well processed. It would be nice to have an interior subdivision",4
3862,As a vestibule on the terrace good stBil and cheap,4
3863,"As described, totally sufficient for private use",4
3864,"Fast-paced gamplay, cool graphics. Only the story is too thin for me.",4
3865,"Was very pleased with the packaging; looks appealing, recommended as a gift for Christmas, I would recommend again and again.",4
3866,"The 100 balloons, which according to the delivered packaging are more like a quarter of a pound of balloons, were delivered quickly and easily. Since there is no number of balloons on the packaging, I have counted and 102 balloons are also included. The packaging itself is already very worn and looks older. However, the balloons can be inflated well and the ones tested so far are also stable, so not outdated. The color in the inflated state is not as matt white as with other balloons but rather slightly transparent. For me a good product with light prints, therefore 4 stars.",4
3867,I am very satisfied. So far no complaint. Let's wait and see how long the mowers last. Hasn't been worn often,4
3868,Works well. After long rinsing plastic taste is gone but next day the same water tastes full of plastic that you can not drink,4
3869,"fast delivery, top seller - ordered the thing to remove blackheads from my daughter's ear. Unfortunately, this didn't really work as expected, hence a point deduction. But this is probably also due to the fact that she did not endure the pain for so long, as I really had to press very hard to get the blackheads removed. On and around the nose the things work perfectly. Clogged pores can be effectively cleaned. So all in all a great product and the tweezers are very precisely worked.",4
3870,"Unfortunately, I first assumed that my battery no longer wants with the almost twice the power as to my old device charges this stadium very well, with the S6 unfortunately the camera between the plate so the mobile phone can not bring maximum contact with the station, therefore a star deduction, it is for the price think much healthier than a new mobile phone,  for this it also charges the mobile phone when it is horizontal e.B. when you see a series of amazon prime, so I no longer have to make unnecessary brackets every time:)",4
3871,"Many good suggestions, sometimes described somewhat inaccurately",4
3872,"The pants fit well but they are rather larger. The shade is rather gray. Also, the pants sit rather loosely, especially at the knees. After washing, no change in the material. Article is recommended.",4

All in all, price-performance top, does what it should, I like to buy even more products from this manufacturer",4
3874,"Very fixed delivery, really top. The packaging could be better padded, despite edge protection which was very good, the gate had two dents on the frame. Otherwise great gate for the money. Had to complain accordingly, but the seller will already judge that.",4

3877,"On the whole, I am satisfied with the fruit. It has a nice size to play and my little one has a lot of fun to test the magnet fruit on all other magnetic objects in the house. Unfortunately, the magnets for the large fruit pieces such as the watermelon are a bit weak, so that the individual parts hardly hold together. I think that's a pity, that's why a star deduction.",4
3878,"Very pretty, practical and robust case, which securely packs the phone and gives you the opportunity to put something in card format. In the beginning it was stunned, but that went away.",4

3884,Very nice film with a top-class cast.,4
3885,"You don't really have to say much more about under armour. An absolute must-have for all sports enthusiasts. The shirt really leads the heat and sweat away from the body and thus creates a reduction in moisture and offers additional cooling. Important! Order directly your normal size, the information according to which you should order a size smaller because of a wide cut, I can not confirm.",4

3890,can be recommended,4
3891,"However, the price is too high but just right for the Bagotte suction and wiping robot.",4
3892,"Super fast delivery. The cards look great, beautiful colors and shine. I subtract a tiny dot because the column with the time is very small.",4
3893,"On the whole good, fits perfectly for the reader. But I would prefer it if you could plug the reader in sideways. Pushing in from above or out again is a bit exhausting. But otherwise to recommend also the color is not garish so that it is a beautiful green.",4
3894,"A great invention in itself - it really works. Even with a light touch, the material cools immediately. Unfortunately, our dog does not like the mat, not even with a thin cotton cover. What a pity. The mat looks very robust and well made, but I can not say anything about the longevity due to lack of use. The mat is quite heavy.",4
3895,"A great book, easy to understand, but lacks vivid material. That's why I deduct a star. Otherwise, I am more than satisfied with the recipes. The court is in Polish and german. I like that very much. The preparation is only german.",4

3897,Very good facility for the price Kammera could be a bit better but you see what you have to.,4
3898,"The stickers can be removed well, stick well, but could stick more firmly, on 1-2 I had to drive over them more often to get them glued tightly. Visually great!👍🏻",4
3899,For the price completely OK.,4
3900,"Ideal size, very good workmanship. The closure is also neatly sewn into a seam. The film is very thin, so I hope the shade is reasonably sturdy.",4
3901,"used these headphones for training (running, cycling) which worked really well. unfortunately after about half a year cracking on the speakers to hear, which was very disturbing. Otherwise a good price/performance ratio. Return was unproblematic",4

3906,It is wonderful as a little fun gift even for older people. z.B.: as a faithful companion for a truck driver.,4

3912,"Practical part. A bit of play on the drive, but easy to get over at the price",4
3913,"Quality not so great, but extremely inexpensive, fits already",4
3914,Nice plastic but could be a bit more colorful,4
3915,"Delicious mixture, (for my Empfingen) little heat. A little too much salt and too little sweetness. But at this price/performance ratio completely fine.",4
3916,"Overall, I like it very much!",4

3920,Bracket can also be mounted laterally,4
3921,Stylish sunglasses with a golden frame. Product is relatively light and looks cleanly processed but is not too high quality. But it is also difficult to expect more quality for this price. If you want to have cool sunglasses for not too much money is well advised with this product. I have owned the glasses for 2 months now and so far no signs of wear can be seen - therefore clear purchase recommendation!,4
3922,"For the night it could be a bit darker. Otherwise, I am very satisfied: good handling, precise buttons, good radio reception.",4
3923,"Quality is great and my daughter can hold it well and likes it. However, the characters don't exactly look friendly. With a children's cutlery, the animals should laugh and not look sad!!!",4
3924,Does not fit with the otterbox. Disc dissolves again. Otherwise good.,4
3925,The cartridges are perfectly recognized and have a rich color. Hopefully the colors will remain stable for longer. Point deduction because a cartridge had leaked.,4

3927,"While looking for an LED strip that I can install in the recessed grip of my kitchen, I came across this product. After the short-term delivery by Amazon, I was able to inspect the product first - on the attached photo the scope of delivery is shown. The quality of the LED strip makes a high-quality impression. The power supply and the remote control also meet my expectations. In addition to the built-in battery, a spare battery for the remote control is included. Only the connection between power supply and LED strip is a bit shaky, which is why I have to subtract a star in my review. Unfortunately, my kitchen, the original installation location is not yet finished, which is why I have attached two photos of the LED strip in non-installed condition to represent the function for potential buyers.",4
3928,The umbrella has a good price/performance ratio. It is stable and visually appropriate.,4
3929,"I wear size 36 and have ordered the skirt one size larger. It looks exactly like in the picture and fits perfectly. It is only a little longer than can be seen in the photo. The material is not particularly breathable, which is why you sweat a bit underneath but you can not complain about the price at all. Would have bought me in a different color, if a suitable one had been there",4
3930,So far everything is perfect,4
3931,"Everything almost OK. Packaging inside was a bit damaged at the corner, torn? Probably before she had fallen. Unfortunately some dark paper, not enough wise paper.",4
3932,Totally pleasant fabric,4
3933,I like the article very much and meets my expectations. Small downer: the belt tab is wrong for my height. I sewed them on the long side. Wonderful,4
3934,The fuel paste can be dosed very well and is therefore also very economical in consumption. Burns well and without residues.,4
3935,Somewhat difficult delivery despite presence not delivered Packaging quite damaged,4

3938,"nice handkerchiefs, good price, fast delivery Gladly again, thank you very much",4
3939,"I compared the different mount adapters available. Among the numerous offers made of ABS plastic, this product stood out because it is made of an aluminum alloy. Overall, it makes a good and stable impression. It is well padded inside, so that the Osmo Pocket sits wobble-free inside. There is a point deduction for the locking screw: this likes to fall out of its hole and is very thin on the thread side, so you have to screw it in very carefully so as not to destroy the thread. This should be improved. You can't expect Novoflex quality at this price.",4
3940,"The Somikon acrylic sheets with a size of 40x40 cm are sufficient for smaller objects. If the plates are treated with care and stowed well, they will not scratch so quickly. Definitely recommended for beginners. So far, I am satisfied.",4

3944,Delivered quickly. Price ok . So far I can not say anything negative. Fulfills its purpose. I can recommend providers. Thank you,4
3945,I liked the movie. The film is suitable for an entertaining and exciting evening. Even the boss couldn't get away from it,4
3946,"Very sturdy scratching post. Was immediately accepted by the Stubentiger. Processing is really no comparison to the cheaper scratching posts. The delivery took less than a week. A point deduction for a lying recess that already has a hole after a week. (My cats weigh 5.5 kilos) this should not happen at the price. Did not complain but patched. Despite everything, I can only recommend him.",4
3947,"Nice simple bag. Only 1 star deduction because the button had to be sewn again, which did not withstand longer use. Fits a lot in:-)",4
3948,The Blasting Rig Transporter has fully met expectations as a gift.,4
3949,"The delivery took a very long time, but the product was good. The cards are perfectly protected and no longer scratch or bend in the wallet or are bent.",4
3950,Great product... anytime again...,4
3951,"In itself great article, and so far very nice quality, have the earrings / piercings for a week in my ear hole and it was neither inflamed, nor have they tarnished; In other words, the material specification is correct (which is rarely the case). The reason why I got them was that my 4 ear holes in which I had earrings have always been so pinged when lying down, now my problem has been solved perfectly and I feel nothing disturbing anymore!! One star deduction, however, because I only got 4 different pairs and 2 earrings, one of which fits another pair",4
3952,"The adapter makes a reltiv high-quality impression. The two threads fit wonderfully and the ring does exactly what it should. A star trigger is available for the thin version. How stable it is remains to be seen. Otherwise, a clear purchase recommendation for the price.",4
3953,"I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. Very good is the supplied plug-in sensor cable, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly constructed. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only once to three times a day (adjustable) are displayed in the app to protect the battery. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite fiddly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect on its own, even if you put it near the router. You have to take out the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm if the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a bit louder.",4
3954,"I think it looks very stable, have it now 3 weeks and my bike is still there. I give the 4 stars because I find the locking cylinder very choppy.",4
3955,The delivery was again super fast. I have only been using this product for a few days. So I can't report too much. I've already lost a bit of weight. It seems to work. Let's see how it goes. Evaluation will follow.,4
3956,I bought breakfast for the kindergarten and it is really well received. Is just smaller than expected but still fits.,4
3957,I am very satisfied with the set workmanship and quality great. Very stable and the knives are sharp. That's all you can say.,4
3958,"In itself beautiful gift for little girls. The nail polish is just not usable, after drying it immediately detaches from the nails and especially for children this is quite stupid, they want to have something of it. Otherwise bag is well made and the price is also ok.",4
3959,Bought here at amazon and in use for some time ... so here is my review and my experiences. What speaks for / against the purchase? + close mesh + easy to attach + looks good - something big packed yourself Have fun with it. I hope it was helpful - then I am happy about a click.,4
3960,Good and fast delivery,4
3961,"Writing is not bad, OK, I think the price can be cheaper.",4
3962,"It works well, let rinse the 10 min and then take Olaplex 10 min and rinse. top results and the hair is beautiful.",4
3963,"Very cool part and really quiet. In the beginning, the description for the operation took some getting used to, but when you have it out, the fan runs really well. A bit more ""wumms"" I expected",4
3964,"The washable pads are really great. They come with 2 bags, one for storage, one for washing. The pads are soft and dissolve even waterproof mascara very well. So far I have only tried hand washing, but that worked very well, I am already looking forward to the first wash in the machine. However, I was very disappointed with the packaging. Because unlike pictured, the pads came in a plastic bag. A bitter disappointment, especially since I have not found anywhere information on how to wash the pads. Hence the prints for the packaging design, but this should not deter anyone from buying the pads, after all, you save a lot of additional packaging waste with them.",4
3965,"Unfortunately only after the holiday can test - seems to work, but it is not really easy to keep a heavy suitcase so still that ""hold"" appears every time on the display, but you can still see the approximate (on the wobble) weight of the suitcase.",4
3966,"In general, I liked this part, only the feet are cut a bit large.",4
3967,"I imagined the product a bit higher quality (horn does not work properly and steering wheel can be easily pulled out), but the little one likes it so I don't want to complain big and give 4 stars",4
3968,Shoes were delivered quickly.,4
3969,"Absolutely sufficient for my party cellar. It is projected directly onto a white wall. But it has to be REALLY dark, otherwise the device quickly reaches its limits. Absolutely TOP for my purpose. And you can't complain about the price. Installation is also quite easy.",4
3970,"The drone is fun to fly, is easy to control and convinces by the acceptable flight time of about 7 - 8 minutes per battery. The camera has a satisfying resolution but disappointed by the too low frame rate (jerking) - so you can do little with the flight shots and unfortunately not control via the mobile phone screen. The range of the good remote control of the quite fast drone is unfortunately only about 30m.",4
3971,"The projectors are easy to install with the sensors and the projection is razor sharp. 2 negative aspects,the adhesive film on the back is somewhat weak. (Attached it with mirror tape) And the long delivery time",4
3972,"With this cable I finally managed to connect the monitor to my MacBook. Unfortunately, the cable is a little strange. If you insert the display port end to the stop in the monitor no image. A little bit again and the picture is back. Hm. Uncool. Maybe it's also due to the monitor (but I hardly believe it). In addition, exactly this end of the cable makes whirring noises, which I personally find very annoying, but are not necessarily audible in everyday office life.",4
3973,Looks good. Is good for combing even for damp hair great,4
3974,"Good solubility: No lumps when using 300ml of milk per scoop. Good taste: No too intense taste and not too sweet. Packaging ok: Very thin bag, so a transfer would probably make sense during transport.",4
3975,"The binoculars are small, stable and show a sharp resolution with 10x magnification. The two objective lenses are adjustable and you can observe objects, animals or for concerts up to a distance of 1000m well. Adjusting the sharpness is good and easy, the material is slippery and waterproof in light drizzling rain. Even at dusk you can observe the opposite well, but need a small light source, because in complete darkness you can not see anything despite binoculars. The binoculars are perfectly fine, small, stable and handy for outdoor wildlife observations. The quality is also quite satisfactory, but does not arrive at a professional device, but rather serves as a small hobby device.",4
3976,The chair looks very noble and is also easy to set up. You can still sit comfortably even after a long time. One point deduction because the chair one day after delivery directly cost 15 euros less than at the time of my order.,4
3977,"Actually, there is nothing to complain about. So far, nothing has broken or come loose. They don't look particularly chic but also not totally cheap. I am satisfied and would buy you me again.",4
3978,"I bought a blue one and unfortunately the color is not as pictured, but a real dark blue which was very disappointing. If you expect this beautiful blue, you will be just as disappointed as I am.",4
3979,Well processed is enough.,4
3980,"For the price they are ok, the vacuum cleaner is in operation every 2 days, the wear I find ok. I will order the carbon brushes again, then it is the 2nd replacement pair.",4
3981,Got it as a gift. Super color selection in the package. Certainly the paints do not cover as well as branded products but I was aware of that at the price. All bottles were intact on delivery and nothing leaked.,4
3982,"The fabric is wonderfully smooth and dimensionally stable. However, I did not know that the zipper is attached to the short side of the pillow. When I put my pillow in the cover for the first time after washing, the seam on the zipper crashed tremendously. But nothing has been torn yet and so I will continue to test the stability of the closure.",4
3983,"Overall, the lamp is very neatly processed and has a good material quality. The luminous efficacy is slightly lower than expected, but the light color is very pleasant. The assembly is a bit cumbersome and requires tact. With the built-in LEDs, it is to be hoped for a long service life, as they are not easily replaceable.",4
3984,"Very fast and lightweight tablet. Good battery life. It is not necessarily to be used for photos, as sometimes a brightening flash is missing. Otherwise a nice sharp display.",4
3985,"When the package came, I thought, ""Oh, is that small."" The bags look a bit thin at first glance. The sizes are right. I immediately put the wobbly hand pump aside. My first test was the cushions and pads of the garden furniture. I stuffed the bags, closed them and vacuumed them with the vacuum cleaner. This worked very well and suddenly the big pile was pillows and flat bit. With the hand pump you would have pumped a wolf. All in all, I am satisfied, even if the price for a few bags with plastic closure is not exactly cheap. The result counts and the price level is better than with other products.",4
3986,All good again,4
3987,"The trailer was delivered quickly, my husband had assembled it quickly. And the best our dog likes to drive with it. So it meets our expectations. The only thing we have to complain about is, on the first ride on dirt roads, an axle or the wheel has bent. My husband has straightened it and he is driving again. I can't say anything about the durability yet, because then the winter came and the trailer is not used at the moment. Which is also positive, we also use the trailer in our other car as a dog transport box. Works very well.",4
3988,"Very nice idea, but unfortunately also a bit unstable. Difficult to handle for children.",4
3989,"The liquid tastes really good, also like blueberry, but does not have the blueberry taste you know! Should be revised again (taste) but otherwise everything top!",4
3990,"We bought the big bedspread because we both like turquoise. The color is as shown. Simply great. However, the chemical smell is very unpleasant. We have already washed the blanket several times now and the blanket still smells chemical. What a pity. Otherwise a great bedspread.",4
3991,"Fit was really good for the Seat and could be glued perfectly. The film is a bit matte than the varnish, but that's probably just the way it is. I have wet glued the film, so it can still be aligned.",4
3992,"Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on good luck. The mattress and a car air pump were included in the scope of delivery. About the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it does not reappear. In the inflated state, a lying test was carried out directly. It fits well on it and fits perfectly to the festival. Of course, this mattress can not replace your own bed, but the one for days at the event it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. Before that, we took out the seats at the back. Thus, it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something on the solder joint). Since my friend is skilled in craftsmanship, he was able to repair it and reassembled, the good part worked excellently and inflated the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope that it won't lose any air and will last a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend them. If I have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).",4
3993,Basically very tasty. A star deduction is available for the clear sweetener aftertaste. With a few ice cubes and a little more water but perfectly fine. Definitely recommended for the summer,4
3994,"More expected, but still good to look at",4
3995,Not for long legs. Great sweat fabric cuffs at the foot a bit too far,4
3996,"Too much bling bling for my taste, well made, a real eye-catcher because the pendant is really big.",4
3997,The packing bags are practical due to their different sizes and closure options. This makes it easy to keep order in any suitcase and backpack. Only the plastic smell could be reduced. It only evaporates after some time.,4
3998,"Not the strongest, but it was well done!",4
3999,The bottles are good and tight. The pipettes are not the big hit and arrived bent in the middle with me. For the price still okay.,4
4000,We used the tent pad as a tarpaulin for pulling for our carport and are enthusiastic about the quality. We had to shorten it a bit and the sewing went without any problems.,5
4001,"A great collar! The leather is buttery soft and the workmanship is great. The price is absolutely fair, would buy it again at any time.",5
4002,"Quickly delivered, assembly without problems. If you want to do something for fitness in your own four walls in winter, the device is well served. Price performance Top!",5
4003,Totally cute the crown. I cut off the ribbons and glued the crown to a hairband because my daughter doesn't like it when something sits tightly on her neck. My daughter still wore the crown days after her birthday. Very pretty... an eye-catcher for the birthday child!,5
4004,Very good as expected,5
4005,We use the battery in a Gigaset handset. There he lasts a good 8 days. This is not a best value but very fine. Would recommend to buy! Very fair price.,5
4006,"After receiving it, we played a week-long one. Very nice material, feels super in the genital area, even on the hand a feeling as you want it from a sex toy. I can only recommend it :))))",5
4007,"We received the swimming ring shortly before Pentecost holidays. Now our baby was also allowed into the water with it. With the sun canopy it is really awesome, it also looks totally cute, an absolute eye-catcher! The material is also very thick and pleasant, good quality. The baby also enjoyed it, we can only recommend the ring!",5
4008,"Absolutely stylish and comfortable shirt. In terms of fit, it is just right. Great cut, beautiful colors. I am very satisfied.",5
4009,"The shipping went with Prime as always lightning fast I ordered the grill mats for our grill and oven to save me the cumbersome cleaning. The grill mats arrived very quickly and well packed with me. Especially the grilling has always been annoying for me, because I knew that I would have to clean the grill again forever afterwards. The grill mat has definitely passed the grill test. The grilling works great and the mat can be easily and easily cleaned again.",5
4010,Very good condition of the Blu-ray. Fast delivery.,5
4011,Hamma. Play table tennis in the living room. Really awesome I can recommend to everyone. The workmanship is also really class,5
4012,"Very bright and inexpensive lighting (not only suitable for bicycles), which can be attached very easily and flexibly. I bought them mainly because of my broken taillight. But will also use them as additional lighting after I have repaired the rear light.",5
4013,Ingenious thing - works perfectly,5
4014,Very cool idea of the bags Beautifully processed and great print We had a lot of fun with it at the Jungesellen farewell :) gladly again,5
4015,My first claim for me was the space-saving positioning on my desk. At this price you should not expect a designer piece. But even the simple plastic processing convinces with its functionality and stability even for heavier remote controls. It also offers Patz for some other things and easily accessible through the rotation function for everything. For simple and undemanding use so absolutely recommended.,5
4016,"Everything went well, gladly again!.......................................................................................... ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",5
4017,I am enthusiastic about vrs design. Great design and convincing quality. I will order this case again in a different color. Absolute purchase recommendation !!!!,5
4018,I am very satisfied with this watch.. Thanks Amazon.,5
4019,"Absolutely high-quality workmanship of the mobile phone case. I can only recommend. Although the shell is very light, it is not expensive, the price of 12 euros I think it is worth it! Highly recommended. Beautiful design.",5
4020,Great pictures. Very good for 4-7 years.,5
4021,"as described,great",5
4022,I'm super happy with the interface. The sound is great and it also looks very chic. The handling is also easy. I can only recommend it,5
4023,I ordered the pens to decorate clay paper. The colors have a beautiful metallic shine and look noble. By appropriate posture of the pen you can paint / write thinner or thicker. I am very happy with the pens and would order them again at any time,5
4024,"Just ordered my 2nd bottle. Now feel better and more vital after 2 weeks, I can only recommend.",5
4025,I keep buying supplies.,5
4026,"I bought the bumpers because the bumpers broke off on my Elite controller (connection jet. With a YT manual it also worked wonderfully to change the bumpers. It is important that they fit perfectly with me and everything works as usual again. Personally, I don't care that they are black, I think that's a matter of taste",5
4027,Good value for money.,5
4028,great workmanship and clean shave,5
4029,"Works great for a few weeks now. The luminosity is much brighter than the previous incandescent lamps, I think that was 40 watts (used in our bathroom, so small room). The light color is also very pleasant - similar to the incandescent lamps. Clear purchase recommendation!",5
4030,"It may take a long time after the charging process is complete. Can be hung up, there are multiple modes, camping and emergency is very good",5
4031,The delivery was fast as usual. Very well packed everything great. The watch is very nicely processed and actually not audible. It is perfect for learning the clock. Easy to understand and super readable. I would recommend them at any time and also give them away.,5

I think the play of colors is great, whereby the colors are static and cannot be changed. Also the uneven illumination, the color ""swells"" past the edges of the keys does not bother me, on the contrary I find it sympathetic. The buttons are easy to read in daylight.

I also wear the watch when swimming, doing sports, at work, in my free time, a real, precise all-rounder. In my opinion, you almost never need a smartwatch with the mobile phone in your pocket or a reasonable holder for the car and you usually only have to charge it all the time.

The whole thing is as small as possible and with an appealing design. This set meets all these requirements. The keyboard has a very pleasant pressure point, the touch of the keys is a bit loud, but that's perfectly fine for me. The mouse lies well in the hand and the mouse buttons do not have to be pressed very deep to react. I use the set for office applications as well as for gaming and find it suitable for both. However, if you are looking for a wireless set purely for home and use a lot of office applications, you should rather look for a larger keyboard with a number pad. However, the set absolutely fulfills my purposes.",5

4796,"Punctual delivery,and nice products.Anyway again👍",5
4797,"I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only by eating healthy but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.",5

Even if you prefer to bake smaller muffins, no problem, here nothing overcoats at all and they look very nice. I can recommend 100%. Other baking pans from Wilton are also far better than the usual ones and the price as I think is also more than reasonable. Good quality at a reasonable price.",5

4809,"I bought the mirror tiles for the bathroom on the boat and glued two so far. For safety's sake, I bought strong mounting tape for damp rooms, because a boat moves in contrast to an apartment and is also exposed to more extreme temperatures. The mirrors are very even and well worked on the edges. Fair price for good goods!",5
4810,"Delivery took place before the specified delivery date. The price-performance ratio is definitely right, for the price the quality is really satisfactory. The bag looks great, the storage space is sufficient for a small purse, mobile phone, bowl, sunglasses.",5

4812,"I have been mainly using Teufel products for many years. Teufel has the best price/performance in this segment in my opinion. Also the Real Blue headphones meet exactly what most test Internet also say. Great sounds in all areas, comfortable to wear, very very light and super processed both in quality and in appearance. The market should learn a lot from this and not sell things with totally overpriced prices, where various celebrities run around. For the normal music lover, I highly recommend this model...",5
4813,I gave this horse away and it was very well received by the gift. Highly recommended. I would also buy it again.,5

4824,"If you follow the instructions on the glass, you get a good result. When ironing, however, I would put a cotton cloth between the iron and the painted fabric. Before washing, the color was even richer, but the subject is still very beautiful, just a bit paler. I would recommend to let the paint dry and paint over it again. Fie quantity of color is very productive!",5
4825,"good quality, if I first bought the watch from Burei, which I like very much, then I recommended it to my friend. This is my second purchase of Burei as a gift for my friend. They are very happy!",5
4826,"I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters which I already had to send back unfortunately could not do this. Practical is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. For what else do I use my PlayStation :P There was a small adapter where it can be attached to the tablet. This should bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, this does not fit with the adapter. Naja also keeps so safe and has contact therefore... All in all although a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, very small the whole and in an aluminum piece stably manufactured. Price performance fits.",5

4834,"I originally wanted to use the Magic Wallet to replace another wallet. The wallet is delivered in a gift box, acts like a small drawer. I find it very nice and this also makes it possible to simply give away the product. The distribution of the product is very good, the feel is very pleasant and the wallet also looks good. The credit cards and also perso and health card can be easily distributed to the various pockets, but in some places I had to push a little tighter. But the cards probably don't fall out so easily. The coin compartment is provided with a zipper. I find the ribbons for the banknotes as well as the functionality behind them very good, the banknotes are kept safe and the children are thrilled how a banknote suddenly disappears behind the ribbons. However, the Magic Wallet is a bit thicker than my current wallet, so I'm more likely to give it away.",5

Included are two batteries, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full points for it and believe it lasts at least as long as the old caliper.
